The teahouse is generally used as a forum to help new users with editing Wikipedia not for general knowledge queries. If you tell me the word, I can try to help, but, in the future, such questions should be asked at the reference desk.

I made a List of ~10000 brocken URLs User:âµ“/Worklist brocken URLs with Quarry:query/78127 (feel free to fork it) The SQL query filters not existing top level-domains, all URLs in this List are broken. The Domain in list is in reversed order (el_to_domain_index) Most of the cases are easy to fix (i.e remove a white space-character). In some cases I needed a URL-decoder ( meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/). More difficult cases can only be solved with the help of the version history or with the help of web archives and Google search. (i.e. https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2018%E2%80%9319_Ukrainian_First_League&diff=prev&oldid=1185545810 ) I fixed this kind of errors in german wikipedia so Quarry:query/77794 is clean. But I am not able to do this in english wikipedia. âµ“ (talk) 17:57, 17 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Hello, âµ“, and welcome to the Teahouse. (I'm surprised that your user name is acceptable, to be honest). What is it you are asking, exactly? If you are inviting other people to do some of the work you have chosen to do - well, there might be somebody who is interested, but that is not really what this page is for.

The teacher is named in the article as having falsified exam results. It didn't seem to me that the image added anything to the article and I also thought it might be contrary to WP:BLPPRIVACY, though images are not mentioned in that policy. I'm wondering though about the image of the headteacher which was already in the article. Again, I'm not sure it adds anything for the reader; but thinking about privacy specifically, looking at WP:IMAGEPOL I see that privacy in policy terms is only an issue if the picture was taken in a public place. The image in this case was taken outside a school. Is a school a public or private place as far as this policy is concerned? I checked the essay at WP:WPSCH/AG, but it does not cover images of staff. Thanks. Tacyarg (talk) 22:07, 17 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] School is a public place and considering she didn't just fake 1 exam but 50, that would in, my opinion, justify a photo of her taken outside the school being included in the article. GriffinGeiling (talk) 22:14, 17 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Sorry, I wasn't clear. I wasn't asking about my removal of the picture of the teacher (the image doesn't make it clear where that was taken), but what policy is about including pictures of headteachers. I'm interested in the general policy as well as relating to this particular article. Tacyarg (talk) 22:21, 17 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] @Tacyarg: This doesn't answer your question, but commons:File:PhilCubbon.png has been nominated for speedy deletion for allegedly being a copyright violation. GoingBatty (talk) 23:29, 17 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Why is it necessary to have a photograph of any person connected with this school? How is her physical appearance of encyclopedic notability at all? I see no reason for any photograph of any person to be associated with this article. - Julietdeltalima (talk) 23:58, 17 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] @Tacyarg Offhand, I can't point to any guidelines or essays that will specifically justify inclusion/exclusion of an image of a member of staff of a school. But all images need to be relevant, appropriate, and give added encyclopaedic value to an article. If one wants to know what staff members look like, then an WP:EXTERNALLINK to the school website should suffice in the majority of cases. It would certainly be WP:UNDUE in my opinion to include a photo of staff members/head teachers, irrespective of whether or not they were subject to media scrutiny, unless that person were already WP:NOTABLE. It definitely is so in the instance of a controversy relating to staff actions. As always, common sense applies, and I think the editor who added the copyright images and claiming them as their own was trying to WP:RIGHTGREATWRONGS, as these were virtually their only edits. Nick Moyes (talk) 00:00, 18 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] We should probably lean on the side of caution and remove both photos. When he's not the principal or whatever anymore, the photo is going to be removed anyway. ~WikiOriginal-9~ (talk) 00:01, 18 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Thank you all, that is helpful. Tacyarg (talk) 00:26, 18 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] To be honest, the article's handling of the teacher who got reprimanded is not great. It accuses her of faking more than 50 results, supporting this with a pay-walled article (acceptable but not ideal when supporting highly negative information) and an article that was written before the hearing that dealt with her case. Meanwhile, an article written after the hearing states 40.[1] The other articles I find talking 50+ are also pre-hearing, which implies that maybe she was "acquitted" of 10+, and we should not err on the high side. The article has also clearly misled GriffinGeiling into believing she faked 50 exams whereas so far as I can see she faked the teacher-assessment of 40? pupils in one exam. Our article's one-liner also fails to reflect the background behind the case (that she was struggling with work-load; that she had already been suspended from work for a long period; that she had expressed great contrition and admitted she'd messed up). We should be very cautious of stuff that encourages readers to jump to tabloid-conclusions about real, living individuals. And ultimately, events like this should have sustained coverage to be encyclopaedia-worthy. I can find no sustained coverage of this event. And that's ignoring the grammatical error. Elemimele (talk) 19:12, 18 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] The article is up for deletion. The handing of the teacher incident in the article is, to me, a very clear, gross and rank BLP violation. --Tagishsimon (talk) 19:55, 18 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Urgent Assistance Needed: Conflict of Interest Disclosure Process[edit] Dear Wikipedia Teahouse, I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to seek urgent assistance with a conflict of interest (COI) matter that I am currently facing on Wikipedia. I have been following the guidance provided, but unfortunately, I am struggling to find the specific process for disclosure. The situation is further complicated as my edits are being revoked without a clear resolution. I believe a lack of disclosure is the root cause, and I am eager to rectify this as soon as possible. Given the urgency of the matter and my commitment to aligning with Wikipedia's policies, I kindly request your guidance on the COI disclosure process. If there is a specific avenue or protocol that I may have overlooked, your expertise would be invaluable. The timely resolution of this issue is crucial to ensuring that my contributions comply with Wikipedia's standards. I would appreciate any assistance or clarification you can provide in this regard. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter, and I look forward to your guidance. Best regards, Chitheenabler Chitheenabler (talk) 22:33, 17 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Hello, @Chitheenabler and welcome to the Teahouse. You can dislose a COI on your user page on the talk page of the article, or in your edit summary. I see you've already disclosed it on your talk page, which is a good first step.
