It joined the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1926 which later became the International Cricket Council.[2] The BCCI is an autonomous, private organization that does not fall under the purview of the National Sports Federation of India of Government of India and does not receive any grants from the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports. The BCCI is influential in international cricket.[19][20][21] The International Cricket Council shares the largest part of its revenue with the BCCI. IPL run by BCCI is one of the wealthiest sports leagues in the world.[22] In financial year 2022-2023, BCCI earned ₹6,558 crore (US$820 million). BCCI paid ₹4,000 crore (US$500 million) in taxes for the financial year 2022-23.[23][details 1] Grant Govan was the first BCCI president and Anthony De Mello was its first secretary.[24] As of February 2023[update], Roger Binny is the incumbent BCCI president and Jay Shah is secretary.[25][26] BCCI has hosted multiple ICC World Cups,[a] and will host the 2023 Cricket World Cup, the 2026 ICC T20 World cup, the 2031 ICC ODI Cricket World Cup,[b] and the 2025 Women's Cricket World Cup.[28][c] The BCCI manages four squads that represent India in international cricket; the men's national cricket team, the women's national cricket team, the men's national under-19 cricket team and women's national under-19 cricket team. It also governs developmental India A, India B and India A women's teams.[29] Its national selection committee, which is led by chief national selector, selects players for these teams.[d] As part of its duties, the BCCI organises and schedules matches to be played by each of these teams, and schedules, sanctions and organises domestic cricket in India.[30][31][32] History[edit] This section needs expansion.

These sailors played cricket near their coastal settlements. The first recorded match in India was played between the British army and British settlers in 1751. The world's second-oldest cricket club, Calcutta Cricket Club, was founded in 1792 in present-day Kolkata. The Parsis were the first civilian community to accept cricket as a sport and play it in India.[33] In 1848, they set up the Oriental Cricket Club in present-day Mumbai. In 1850, they founded the Young Zoroastrian Cricket Club. In 1886, Hindus founded the Hindu Gymkhana sports club.[34] In 1912, an all-India cricket team visited England for the first time, and were sponsored and captained by the Maharaja of Patiala. In 1926, two representatives of Calcutta Cricket Club travelled to London to attend meetings of the Imperial Cricket Conference, the predecessor of the current International Cricket Council. Although technically not an official representative of Indian cricket, they were allowed to attend by Lord Harris, chairman of the conference. The outcome of the meeting was the MCC's decision to send a team that was led by Arthur Gilligan, who had captained England in The Ashes, to India.[citation needed] Founding and early years[edit] CK Nayudu (in the 1930s), former Indian cricketer, Indian cricket team's first captain in Test cricket In a meeting with the Maharaja of Patiala and others, Gilligan promised to press for its inclusion in the ICC if all of the game's promoters in the country united to establish a single controlling body. An assurance was given[by whom?] and on 21 November 1927 a meeting was held in Delhi, which was attended by delegates from Patiala, Delhi, United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, Rajputana, Alwar, Bhopal, Gwalior, Baroda, Kathiawar, Central Provinces and Berar, Sindh and Punjab. The delegates agreed to create a board for control of cricket in India. On 10 December 1927, a unanimous decision to form a provisional board of control was taken, and the BCCI was formed in December 1928. R. E. Grant Govan was elected as its first president and Anthony de Mello was secretary.[35] In 1926, the BCCI joined the Imperial Cricket Council, then the governing body for international cricket. In 1936, the BCCI started India's premier first-class cricket championship the Ranji Trophy, which was named after the first Indian person who played international cricket, the King of Nawanagar state K.S. Ranjitsinhji,[36] who played for England in international cricket. The Mumbai cricket team is the most-successful team, winning 41 titles. In 1932, India played its maiden Test match under the captaincy of C. K. Nayudu against England at Lord's cricket ground in London. During England's 1933-34 tour of India, on 17 December 1933, Lala Amarnath became the first Indian batsman to score a test century, scoring 118 on his debut, at Bombay Gymkhana.[37] In 1967–68, India won its first-ever Test cricket series outside Asia. Previously it had defeated Pakistan, New Zealand and England, and won series in India.[38] 1945–1987[edit] Main articles: History of cricket in India from 1945–46 to 1960, History of cricket in India from 1960–61 to 1970, and History of cricket in India from 1970–71 to 1985 In 1952, the England team toured India; it was their first tour of India after its Independence. Nigel Howard was the captain of touring team.[39] The former India captain Vijaya Ananda Gajapathi Raju, also known as Vizzy, was the BCCI president in the 1960s.[40] In 1975, the BCCI paid ₹2,500 per match to the test cricketers. Banks, Indian railways and private enterprises would recruit players.[41] The board appointed Ajit Wadekar captain in 1971, the Indian team won their first test series against England on English soil, and against the West Indies, Sunil Gavaskar made his test debut in latter series. India won the 1983 Cricket World Cup, defeating the defending champions the West Indies by 43 runs in the final at Lord's. India also won the World Championship of Cricket in 1985, defeating Pakistan by eight wickets in the final at Melbourne Cricket Ground. The BCCI hosted the 1987 World Cup; it was the first time the event was organised outside England.[42] 1987–2000[edit] Main article: History of cricket in India from 1985–86 to 2000 Through the 1980s and early 1990s, BCCI paid ₹5 lakh per match to terrestrial television network Doordarshan to broadcast the Indian cricket team's matches.[43] It hosted the ICC Cricket World Cup competitions in 1987 and 1996.[27][e] In 1991, BCCI proposed South Africa's readmission to international cricket at the International Cricket Council (ICC).[44] After the proposal succeeded, the BCCI sold television broadcast rights for the first time; South African Broadcasting Corporation purchased the rights to broadcast the South African cricket tour of India, South Africa's first official international tour after the 21-year boycott from international cricket.[45] During this time, South Africa joined the "Asian bloc" of the BCCI and its South-Asian neighbours. In 1993, the BCCI signed a deal with TransWorld International (TWI), which would pay the BCCI to televise England's tour of India on satellite television and Doordarshan would pay TWI for the rights to televise the matches in India.[46][47] The 1993 Hero Cup was broadcast on Star TV, which made it the first cricket series to be broadcast on satellite television in India and broke the monopoly of Doordarshan.[48][46] A lengthy legal battle between Doordarshan and the BCCI—which was led by Jagmohan Dalmiya and president I. S. Bindra—ensued. In February 1995, the Supreme Court of India ruled the television rights of India's matches were a commodity belonging to the BCCI, for which the broadcaster must pay BCCI and not the other way around.[49] BCCI, in a joint bid with Pakistan and Sri Lanka, won the rights to host the 1996 Cricket World Cup, defeating the England-and-Australia bloc. The tournament was a commercial success,[50] yielding the ICC a profit of contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 71 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India responseCode 3 200
