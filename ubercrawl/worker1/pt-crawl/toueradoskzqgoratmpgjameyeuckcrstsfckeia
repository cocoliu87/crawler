To change this template's initial visibility, the |state= parameter may be used: {{Wikipedia directories|state=expanded}} will show the template expanded, i.e. fully visible. {{Wikipedia directories|state=autocollapse}} will show the template autocollapsed, i.e. if there is another collapsible item on the page (a navbox, sidebar, or table with the collapsible attribute), it is hidden apart from its title bar, but if not, it is fully visible.
