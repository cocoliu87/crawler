According to US officials, the losses were not expected to impact Ukraine's counteroffensive as a whole.[6] The Russian Defence Ministry said its forces had repelled an offensive by Ukrainian forces involving 1,500 soldiers and 150 armoured vehicles after a two-hour battle with Ukrainian troops in the early hours. In response, Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said only that Russia was conducting "defensive actions" near Orikhiv.[7] Three people, including a child were reported to have been killed by Russian shelling in Ukrainsk, Donetsk Oblast.[8] One person was killed and eight others were wounded after Russian shelling struck a flood evacuation point in Kherson.[9] In Russia, drones struck two settlements in Belgorod Oblast.[10] The Russian Orthodox Church transferred 11 Ukrainian POWs from Zakarpattia Oblast to Hungary, saying that it was a request by the Hungarian government.[11] But despite assurances by the office of Prime Minister Viktor Orban that the prisoners arrived of their own volition and were free to leave the country, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said the Hungarians ignored their requests to contact them, adding that the transfer was conducted without the agreement of the Ukrainian government.[12] On 20 June, three of the POWs were returned to Ukraine.[13] The United Kingdom imposed new sanctions on Belarus for its support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which included banning imports of gold, cement, wood and rubber from Belarus and blocking exports to Belarus of banknotes and machinery, as well as materials that could be used to produce chemical and biological weapons.[14] As part of NATO's efforts to secure its border with Ukraine, Germany announced it would donate two MANTIS Air Defence Systems to Slovakia.[15] 9 June One person was killed and three others injured in a Russian air strike in Zviahel, Zhytomyr Oblast. Eight people were wounded in another attack in Uman. The Ukrainian military said they shot down four out of six missiles launched during the attacks.[16] According to OSINT Defender, an Open Source Intelligence website, the Ukrainian counteroffensive started towards the town of Tokmak in Zaporizhzhia Oblast with a mixture of Leopard tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles.[17] A Russian military spokesman claimed its forces had destroyed 13 tanks in Zaporizhzhia and eight in Donetsk.[18] The Security Service of Ukraine posted an intercepted call on its Telegram channel that claimed to show Russia's responsibility for the Kakhovka Dam's destruction. The call, which news agency Reuters could not immediately verify, was between two Russian-speaking men, with one of whom, described by the Ukraine security service as a Russian soldier, saying that the action at the dam was by a sabotage group under Russian command, and was supposed to "scare" people but "[the group did] more than what they planned for."[19] In Russia, three people were wounded by a drone strike on a residential building in Voronezh.[20] A state of emergency was later declared in the region.[21] President Vladimir Putin said Russia would begin deploying tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus after the staging facilities are ready on 7–8 July.[22] He also said during an interview published on Telegram that the Ukrainian offensive had begun.[23] Belgium announced it would supply Ukraine with 105mm artillery rounds worth 32.4 million euros ($35 million), which would be purchased from Belgian industry and delivered as soon as possible.[24] 10 June During a nighttime attack on Odesa, Russian forces fired two missiles and eight drones. Ukrainian officials reported that all had been shot down. Falling drone debris set fire to an apartment building killing three people. Another 27, including three children, were wounded.[25] An airfield in Poltava Oblast was damaged by missiles. One person was killed in an attack in Kharkiv Oblast.[26] Two people, including a nurse were killed by Russian shelling at a hospital in Huliapole, Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The Ukrainian military claimed to have advanced 1.2 kilometers (0.75 miles) near Bakhmut over the past 24 hours.[27] During a surprise visit by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy acknowledged the start of the country's counteroffensive against Russia. Trudeau also announced 500 million Canadian dollars (£297 million) in new military aid for Ukraine.[26] Radio New Zealand launched an external investigation after discovering that some 15 stories about the war in Ukraine "were edited to align with the Russian view of events" to give a "false account" of the conflict.[28] The station's executive later apologized, admitting that RNZ's editorial systems had been insufficiently robust, while a digital journalist was placed on leave.[29] In Russia, a freight train with fifteen cars was derailed in Belgorod Oblast. No casualties were reported.[30] 11 June Ukraine announced the liberation of the villages of Blahodatne, Makarivka and Neskuchne in Donetsk Oblast, the first settlements it had taken since the start of the counteroffensive. The Russian defence ministry claimed Ukrainian speedboats tried to attack the reconnaissance vessel Priazovye in the Black Sea.[31] A prisoner swap occurred between Russian and Ukrainian POWs, with 94 Russians swapped for 95 Ukrainians.[32] In Russia, a suspected Ukrainian drone crashed near the village of Strelkovka in Kaluga Oblast.[33] Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu ordered all volunteer fighting groups to sign a contract with the ministry, calling it a step towards increasing the effectiveness of Russian forces in Ukraine. However, the Wagner Group's head Yevgeny Prigozhin insisted that they were not covered by the order. Russian media reported it was an attempt by Shoigu to rein in Wagner following Prigozhin's previous outbursts against the military establishment.[34] 12 June Ukraine announced it had retaken seven villages in Z contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 116 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine_(8_June_2023_%E2%80%93_31_August_2023) responseCode 3 200
