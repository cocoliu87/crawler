The term is most commonly used to refer to the regular octahedron, a Platonic solid composed of eight equilateral triangles, four of which meet at each vertex. A regular octahedron is the dual polyhedron of a cube. It is also a rectified tetrahedron, a square bipyramid in any of three orthogonal orientations, and a triangular antiprism in any of four orientations. An octahedron is the three-dimensional case of the more general concept of a cross polytope. A regular octahedron is a 3-ball in the Manhattan (ℓ1) metric. Regular octahedron[edit] Dimensions[edit] If the edge length of a regular octahedron is a, the radius of a circumscribed sphere (one that touches the octahedron at all vertices) is r u = 2 2 a ≈ 0.707 ⋅ a {\displaystyle r_{u}={\frac {\sqrt {2}}{2}}a\approx 0.707\cdot a} and the radius of an inscribed sphere (tangent to each of the octahedron's faces) is r i = 6 6 a ≈ 0.408 ⋅ a {\displaystyle r_{i}={\frac {\sqrt {6}}{6}}a\approx 0.408\cdot a} while the midradius, which touches the middle of each edge, is r m = 1 2 a = 0.5 ⋅ a {\displaystyle r_{m}={\tfrac {1}{2}}a=0.5\cdot a} Orthogonal projections[edit] The octahedron has four special orthogonal projections, centered, on an edge, vertex, face, and normal to a face. The second and third correspond to the B2 and A2 Coxeter planes. Orthogonal projections Centered by Edge Face Normal Vertex Face Image Projective symmetry [2] [2] [4] [6] Spherical tiling[edit] The octahedron can also be represented as a spherical tiling, and projected onto the plane via a stereographic projection. This projection is conformal, preserving angles but not areas or lengths. Straight lines on the sphere are projected as circular arcs on the plane. Orthographic projection Stereographic projection Cartesian coordinates[edit] An octahedron with edge length √2 can be placed with its center at the origin and its vertices on the coordinate axes; the Cartesian coordinates of the vertices are then ( ±1, 0, 0 ); ( 0, ±1, 0 ); ( 0, 0, ±1 ). In an x–y–z Cartesian coordinate system, the octahedron with center coordinates (a, b, c) and radius r is the set of all points (x, y, z) such that | x − a | + | y − b | + | z − c | = r . {\displaystyle \left|x-a\right|+\left|y-b\right|+\left|z-c\right|=r.} Area and volume[edit] The surface area A and the volume V of a regular octahedron of edge length a are: A = 2 3 a 2 ≈ 3.464 a 2 {\displaystyle A=2{\sqrt {3}}a^{2}\approx 3.464a^{2}} V = 1 3 2 a 3 ≈ 0.471 a 3 {\displaystyle V={\frac {1}{3}}{\sqrt {2}}a^{3}\approx 0.471a^{3}} Thus the volume is four times that of a regular tetrahedron with the same edge length, while the surface area is twice (because we have 8 rather than 4 triangles). If an octahedron has been stretched so that it obeys the equation | x x m | + | y y m | + | z z m | = 1 , {\displaystyle \left|{\frac {x}{x_{m}}}\right|+\left|{\frac {y}{y_{m}}}\right|+\left|{\frac {z}{z_{m}}}\right|=1,} the formulas for the surface area and volume expand to become A = 4 x m y m z m × 1 x m 2 + 1 y m 2 + 1 z m 2 , {\displaystyle A=4\,x_{m}\,y_{m}\,z_{m}\times {\sqrt {{\frac {1}{x_{m}^{2}}}+{\frac {1}{y_{m}^{2}}}+{\frac {1}{z_{m}^{2}}}}},} V = 4 3 x m y m z m . {\displaystyle V={\frac {4}{3}}\,x_{m}\,y_{m}\,z_{m}.} Additionally the inertia tensor of the stretched octahedron is I = [ 1 10 m ( y m 2 + z m 2 ) 0 0 0 1 10 m ( x m 2 + z m 2 ) 0 0 0 1 10 m ( x m 2 − y m 2 ) ] . {\displaystyle I={\begin{bmatrix}{\frac {1}{10}}m(y_{m}^{2}+z_{m}^{2})&0&0\\0&{\frac {1}{10}}m(x_{m}^{2}+z_{m}^{2})&0\\0&0&{\frac {1}{10}}m(x_{m}^{2}-y_{m}^{2})\end{bmatrix}}.} These reduce to the equations for the regular octahedron when x m = y m = z m = a 2 2 . {\displaystyle x_{m}=y_{m}=z_{m}=a\,{\frac {\sqrt {2}}{2}}.} Geometric relations[edit] Using the standard nomenclature for Johnson solids, an octahedron would be called a square bipyramid. Dual[edit] The octahedron is the dual polyhedron of the cube. If an octahedron of edge length = a {\displaystyle =a} is inscribed in a cube, then the length of an edge of the cube = 2 a {\displaystyle ={\sqrt {2}}a} . Stellation[edit] The octahedron represents the central intersection of two tetrahedra The interior of the compound of two dual tetrahedra is an octahedron, and this compound, called the stella octangula, is its first and only stellation. Correspondingly, a regular octahedron is the result of cutting off from a regular tetrahedron, four regular tetrahedra of half the linear size (i.e. rectifying the tetrahedron). The vertices of the octahedron lie at the midpoints of the edges of the tetrahedron, and in this sense it relates to the tetrahedron in the same way that the cuboctahedron and icosidodecahedron relate to the other Platonic solids. Snub octahedron[edit] One can also divide the edges of an octahedron in the ratio of the golden mean to define the vertices of an icosahedron. This is done by first placing vectors along the octahedron's edges such that each face is bounded by a cycle, then similarly partitioning each edge into the golden mean along the direction of its vector. There are five octahedra that define any given icosahedron in this fashion, and together they define a regular compound. An icosahedron produced this way is called a snub octahedron. Tessellations[edit] Octahedra and tetrahedra can be alternated to form a vertex, edge, and face-uniform tessellation of space. This and the regular tessellation of cubes are the only such uniform honeycombs in 3-dimensional space. Characteristic orthoscheme[edit] Like all regular convex polytopes, the octahedron can be dissected into an integral number of disjoint orthoschemes, all of the same shape characteristic of the polytope. A polytope's characteristic orthoscheme is a fundamental property because the polytope is generated by reflections in the facets of its orthoscheme. The orthoscheme occurs in two chiral forms which are mirror images of each other. The characteristic orthoscheme of a regular polyhedron is a quadrirectangular irregular tetrahedron. The faces of the octahedron's characteristic tetrahedron lie in the octahedron's mirror planes of symmetry. The octahedron is unique among the Platonic solids in having an even number of faces meeting at each vertex. Consequently, it is the only member of that group to possess, among its mirror planes, some that do not pass through any of its faces. The octahedron's symmetry group is denoted B3. The octahedron and its dual polytope, the cube, have the same symmetry group but different characteristic tetrahedra. The characteristic tetrahedron of the regular octahedron can be found by a canonical dissection[1] of the regular octahedron which subdivides it into 48 of these characteristic orthoschemes surrounding the octahedron's center. Three left-handed orthoschemes and three right-handed orthoschemes meet in each of the octahedron's eight faces, the six orthoschemes collectively forming a trirectangular tetrahedron: a triangular pyramid with the octahedron face as its equilateral base, and its cube-cornered apex at the center of the octahedron.[2] Characteristics of the regular octahedron[3] edge arc dihedral 𝒍 2 {\displaystyle 2} 90° π 2 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {\pi }{2}}} 109°28′ π − 2 𝟁 {\displaystyle \pi -2{\text{𝟁}}} 𝟀 4 3 ≈ 1.155 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {\tfrac {4}{3}}}\approx 1.155} 54°44′8″ π 2 − 𝜿 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {\pi }{2}}-{\text{𝜿}}} 90° π 2 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {\pi }{2}}} 𝝓 1 {\displaystyle 1} 45° π 4 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {\pi }{4}}} 60° π 3 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {\pi }{3}}} 𝟁 1 3 ≈ 0.577 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {\tfrac {1}{3}}}\approx 0.577} 35°15′52″ 𝜿 {\displaystyle {\text{𝜿}}} 45° π 4 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {\pi }{4}}} 0 R / l {\displaystyle _{0}R/l} 2 ≈ 1.414 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}\approx 1.414} 1 R / l {\displaystyle _{1}R/l} 1 {\displaystyle 1} 2 R / l {\displaystyle _{2}R/l} 2 3 ≈ 0.816 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {\tfrac {2}{3}}}\approx 0.816} 𝜿 {\displaystyle {\text{𝜿}}} 35°15′52″ arc sec 3 2 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {{\text{arc sec }}3}{2}}} If the octahedron has edge length 𝒍 = 2, its characteristic tetrahedron's six edges have lengths 4 3 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {\tfrac {4}{3}}}} , 1 {\displaystyle 1} , 1 3 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {\tfrac {1}{3}}}} (the exterior right triangle face, the characteristic triangle 𝟀, 𝝓, 𝟁 of the octahedron), plus 2 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}} , 1 {\displaystyle 1} , 2 3 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {\tfrac {2}{3}}}} (edges that are the characteristic radii of the octahedron).
