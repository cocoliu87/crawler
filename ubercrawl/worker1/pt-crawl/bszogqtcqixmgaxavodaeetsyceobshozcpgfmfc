The term was originally used in cricket before being adopted by other sports. The award can go to a player from any team. If team has lost but a player from the losing team has had an incredible performance then he can also be named as Man of the Match. In Test cricket, the man of the match award became a regular feature in the mid-1980s.[1] It is usually awarded to the player whose contribution is seen as the most important in winning the game, but there have been many instances of a player on the losing team receiving the award.[2] In Test matches, Jacques Kallis holds the record for the highest number of awards, with 23 in 166 matches, followed by Muttiah Muralitharan with 19 awards.[1] In ODI matches Sachin Tendulkar holds the record for the highest number of man of the match awards, with 62 in 463 matches.[3] Sanath Jayasuriya is second with 48. In Twenty20 Internationals, Virat Kohli leads with 15 awards.[4] Andrea-Mae Zepeda of Austria completed a clean sweep of POTM awards in a WT20I series against Belgium in September 2021. Hayley Matthews achieved the same feat for the West Indies against Australian in October 2023, despite her team losing the series 2-1.

On these occasions, the commentators and other awarding authorities held on to share the awards, without giving the award to a player of the winning team.[13] In Test cricket there have been rare instances when a joint award for man of the match or man of the series has been announced. However, in ODIs and Twenty20 internationals this is usually when a member of the losing team is the highest scorer, such as when Charles Coventry (194) and Tamim Iqbal (154) shared the award after Zimbabwe lost the match. In another interesting match held on 3 April 1996, the whole New Zealand team was awarded the Man of the Match award by adjudicator Basil Butcher who pronounced it a team performance.[14] It was the first time that a whole team had been given the Man of the Match award.[15] There have been only three occasions, one in test cricket and two in ODI cricket, when the whole team has been awarded the man of the match by considering the team performance rather than individual performances.[13] Team Man of the Match awards[edit] In Test cricket, South Africa has been awarded Team man of the match award, in the West Indies tour in 1998/99 season. The match was won by South Africa by 351 runs and whole 11 players awarded the man of the match award.[13] 15–18 January Scorecard South Africa v West Indies 313 (92.5 overs) Mark Boucher 100 (183) Courtney Walsh 6/80 (24.5 overs) 144 (47.1 overs) Brian Lara 68 (77) Allan Donald 5/49 (13 overs) 399/5d (115.2 overs) Gary Kirsten 134 (305) Carl Hooper 3/117 (36.2 overs) 217 (75.2 overs) Ridley Jacobs 78 (92) Paul Adams 4/64 (21.2 overs) South Africa won by 351 runs SuperSport Park, Centurion Umpires: Aleem Dar (Pak) and Billy Bowden (NZ) Player of the match: South Africa West Indies won the toss and elected to field. This is the first time that the West Indies lost a series 5–0. In ODI cricket, New Zealand team has been awarded man of the match award for their team performances to 4 run victory against the West Indies on 3 April 1996.[16][17] On 1 September 1996, Pakistan team has been awarded man of the match for their team performance against England for their 2 wicket win. 3 April 1996 Scorecard New Zealand 158 (35.5 overs) v West Indies 154 (49.1 overs) Craig Spearman 41 (39) Laurie Williams 3/16 (4.5 overs) Roland Holder 49* (86) Chris Cairns 2/17 (5.1 overs) New Zealand won by 4 runs Bourda, Georgetown, Guyana Umpires: Clyde Duncan (WI) and Eddie Nicholls (WI) Player of the match: New Zealand West Indies won the toss and elected to field. 1 September 1996 Scorecard England 246 (50 overs) v Pakistan 247/8 (49.4 overs) Nick Knight 125* (145) Wasim Akram 3/45 (10 overs) Saeed Anwar 61 (59) Adam Hollioake 4/45 (8.4 overs) Pakistan won by 2 wickets Trent Bridge, Nottingham Umpires: John Holder (Eng) and David Shepherd (Eng) Player of the match: Pakistan England won the toss and elected to bat.

Joint awards in Tests[edit] Joint awards are sometimes given to two players, either from the same team or one from each team. As of 2017, there have been 14 instances where two players from the same team were given the Man of the Match award in Test cricket.[18] # Match Venue Date MoM 1 MoM 2 Result 1 India v Sri Lanka Nagpur 27 December 1986 Dilip Vengsarkar Maninder Singh India won 2 New Zealand v West Indies Christchurch 12 March 1987 Richard Hadlee Ewen Chatfield New Zealand won 3 New Zealand v Sri Lanka Hamilton 22 February 1991 Ian Smith Andrew Jones Drawn 4 New Zealand v Australia Auckland 12 March 1993 Ken Rutherford Danny Morrison New Zealand won 5 contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 70 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Player_of_the_Match_awards_(cricket) responseCode 3 200
