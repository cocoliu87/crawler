Set the |answered= or |ans= parameter to no to reactivate your request. In location, Kolbasna is not a city but a village, thus "Transnistrian city of Kolbasna" should be changed to "Transnistrian village of Kolbasna" ZZARZY223 (talk) 07:42, 2 May 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] Done – Jonesey95 (talk) 18:58, 3 May 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] Extended-confirmed-protected edit request on 10 June 2022[edit] This edit request to Template:2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine infobox has been answered. Set the |answered= or |ans= parameter to no to reactivate your request. Remove the "Supported by: Columbia" in the infobox under Ukraine. The Columbian military will send a team to train the Ukrainian military in demining techniques. This training will be given in a third-party country, so it is comparable to training provided by The Netherlands or Germany on various weapons systems. I do not believe that this training rises to the level of military support. These demining teams will not support any active hostilities, compared to e.g. Belarus, which provided its territory as staging grounds for the Kyiv offensive and airfields for air combat missions. If we do decide to keep the support, we should replace the Russian-language sources with an English-language source, such as this Reuters article: https://www.reuters.com/world/colombia-train-ukrainian-military-landmine-removal-2022-05-23/ YD407OTZ (talk) 16:06, 10 June 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] Already done Proposed edit was already done when I came across this request. Thanks for the heads up though YD407OTZ --N8wilson 21:46, 10 June 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] Why are there no other listed commanders?[edit] Only the presidents are listed. Why is there no mention of key military men in this war like Sergei Shoigu? WR 22:35, 11 July 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] Per WP:INFOBOXPURPOSE, the body of the article only supports the inclusion of those two. Cinderella157 (talk) 00:49, 12 July 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] The body of the article only supports the inclusion of the two. A better solution is to add a link to the list of commanders like the one written in the Vietnam War infobox. Parham wiki (talk) 23:56, 17 April 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] In my view, this is only an end-around the guidance at WP:INFOBOXPURPOSE. The infobox should be a reflection of the article - which it is. Cinderella157 (talk) 00:33, 18 April 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] So why is there a link for the units involved in the battle (Order of battle)? Isn't this redundant? Also the link is given to Invasion Commanders (same as Order of battle article) NOT APOLLO 11!

Neither one claims to exist anymore. WMSR (talk) 18:30, 6 October 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] Both still exist within Russia. They were annexed, but they did not cease to exist. Applodion (talk) 23:05, 13 November 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] Donetsk and Luhansk PRs ware Russian puppet states formally annexed by Russia. They should be removed from the infobox, otherwise we have to include every subject of Russian Federation --Perohanych (talk) 00:00, 26 December 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] @Applodion @Perohanych @WMSR Here's my opinion on this: The annexation of the DPR and LPR to the Russian Federation is internationally unrecognized, so in my opinion, we should not treat them as a subject of the Russian Federation, nor should we treat them as separate countries and use the flag icon in the infobox. So what I've done is I've changed the little parenthetical disclaimer in the infobox to say: "34,000 (separatist militias)" in order to reconcile the two situations.

Set the |answered= or |ans= parameter to no to reactivate your request. Separating the Southern/Kherson Counteroffensive from Southern Ukraine offensive. For some reason they keep getting merged, but like, Southern Ukraine offensive is Russia's offensive and the counteroffensive is well.. Ukraine's offensive to retake land. Its not even said that the counteroffensive has ended. Slimebor (talk) 20:28, 23 January 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] As i said before, the article is NOT named "Southern Ukraine offensive", "its Southern Ukraine CAMPAIGN", the kherson counteroffensive is only a part of the southern campaign/theatre.

Navigation, Formatting, and Content Change Request BEFORE status = Ongoing (list of engagements · territorial control · timeline of events) AFTER timeline = Timeline of events. This page includes a list of 3+ phases and sub-lists, on separate pages, by month with monthly and daily updates listed in descending order. status = Ongoing (list of engagements · territorial control) Commentary Way wonky but none-the-less a timeline is NOT a (parenthetical) status status may be perjorative and singular timeline may be perjorative also, though intending to be chronological and truthy if not factual. At this point, the only reason to visit this collection of pages pertains to developments and very recent history. The bulk of the pages and sub sub sub pages are static and informationally wonky. Other sites have very structured lists / diaries primarily accessed by date-specific URLs, for example: //domain.com/ukraine_war/2023-01-24 This URL is short and sweet and semi-infinitely extensible (until 9999-12-31), includability is high for the next war and its hundreds! of regional predecessors (over 1,000's of years). List_of_wars_involving_Ukraine The other domains do not pretend to be encyclopedic, thus the timeline suits their needs with little other background content. contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 83 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Template_talk:Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine_infobox responseCode 3 200
