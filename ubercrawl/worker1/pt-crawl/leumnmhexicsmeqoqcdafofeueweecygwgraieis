It also serves as the winter capital of the state and the administrative headquarters of the Kangra district since 1855.[5][6][7] The town also hosts the Tibetan Government-in-exile. Dharamshala was a Municipal council till 2015 when it was upgraded to a Municipal corporation. The town is located in the Kangra Valley, in the shadow of the Dhauladhar range of the Himalayas at an altitude of 1457m. Dharamshala and its surrounding areas find references in ancient Hindu scriptures such as Rig Veda and Mahabharata. The region was under the Mughal influence before it was captured by the Sikh empire in 1785. The British captured the region following the First Anglo-Sikh War of 1846 and was part of undivided province of Punjab. Post Indian Independence in 1947, it remained as a small hill station. In 1960, the Central Tibetan Administration was moved to Dharamshala when the 14th Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso established the Tibetan exile administration he had to flee Tibet. The economy of the region is dependent majorly on agriculture and tourism. The town is now a major hill station and spiritual center. It has been selected as one of a hundred in India to be developed as a smart city under Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's flagship "Smart Cities Mission".[8] Etymology[edit] Dharamshala (Devanagari: धर्मशाला; ITRANS: Dharmashala; IAST: Dharmaśālā) is a Hindi word derived from Sanskrit that is a compound of the words dharma (धर्म) and shālā (शाला) literally "House or place of Dharma". In common usage, the word refers to a shelter or rest house for spiritual pilgrims.[9] When permanent settlements were established in the region, there was one such rest house from which the settlement took its name.[10] Due to a lack of uniform observance of transliteration and transcription conventions for Hindi and the Devanagari script in which Hindi is written, the name of the town has been transcribed into English and other languages using Romanic scripts variously as Dharamshala, Dharamsala, Dharmshala and Dharmsala.[10] These four permutations result from two variables: the transcription of the word धर्म (dharma)—particularly the second syllable (र्म) and that of the third syllable (शा). A strict transliteration of धर्म as written would be 'dharma' [ˈdʱərma]. In the modern spoken Hindi of the region, there is a common metathesis in which the vowel and consonant sounds in the second syllable of certain words (including धर्म) are transposed, which changes 'dharma' to 'dharam' pronounced somewhere between [ˈdʱərəm] and [ˈdʱərm]. Regarding the third syllable, the Devanagari श corresponds to the English sh sound, [ʃ] and thus शाला is transcribed in English as 'shala'. Therefore, the most accurate phonetic transcription of the Hindi धर्मशाला into Roman script for common (non-technical) English usage is either 'Dharamshala' or, less commonly, 'Dharmshala', both of which render the sh (/ʃ/) sound of श in English as 'sh' to convey the correct native pronunciation, 'Dharamshala' [dʱərəmˈʃaːlaː] or 'Dharmshala' ([dʱərmˈʃaːlaː]). Regardless of spelling variations, the correct native pronunciation is with the sh sound (/ʃ/).[11] History[edit] Early history[edit] Dharamshala and its surrounding areas find references in ancient Hindu scriptures such as Rig Veda and Mahabharata.[12] There are mentions of the region by Pāṇini in 4th century BC and by Chinese traveler Heun Tsang during the reign of king Harshavardhana in 7th century AD.[13] The indigenous people of the Dharamshala area (and the surrounding region) are the Gaddis, a predominantly Hindu group who traditionally lived a nomadic or semi-nomadic transhumant lifestyle.[14] The region was subject to attacks from Mughal rulers Mahmud of Ghazni in 1009 and Firuz Shah Tughlaq in 1360. In 1566, Akbar captured the region and brought it under the Mughal rule. As the Mughal rule disintegrated, Sikh chieftain Jai Singh brought the region to his control and gave it to Sansar Chand of the Katoch dynasty, legitimate Rajput prince in 1785. Gurkhas invaded and captured the region in 1806 before being defeated by Ranjit Singh in 1809. The Katoch dynasty was reduced to the status of jagirdars under the treaty of Jawalamukhi signed between Chand and Singh in 1810. Post the death of Chand, Ranjit Singh annexed the region into the Sikh empire.[12] British occupation[edit] The British captured the region following the First Anglo-Sikh War of 1846. Under the British Raj, the regions were part of undivided province of Punjab, and were ruled by the governors of Punjab from Lahore.[10] In 1860, the 66th Gurkha Light Infantry was moved from Kangra to Dharamshala, which was at first made a subsidiary cantonment.[15][10] The Battalion was later renamed 1st Gurkha Rifles.[16] Dharamshala became a popular hill station during the British.[10] In 1905, the Kangra Valley suffered a major earthquake destroying much of the cantonment and the infrastructure in the region killing nearly 20,000 including 1,625 at Dharmasala including 15 foreigners and 112 of the Gurkha garrison."[10] Many of the Gurkhas were part of the Indian National Army founded by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose taking part in the Indian Independence movement. Post independence[edit] The architecture in Dharamsala has a Buddhist influence Post Indian Independence in 1947, it remained as a small hill station. On 29 April 1959, the 14th Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso established the Tibetan exile administration in Mussoorie when he had to flee Tibet .[17] In May 1960, the Central Tibetan Administration was moved to Dharamshala when Jawaharlal Nehru, then Prime Minister of India allowed him and his followers to settle in McLeod Ganj north of Dharamshala.[18][19] There they established the "government-in-exile" in 1960 and the Namgyal Monastery.[20] In 1970, Dalai Lama opened the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives which is one of the most important institutions for Tibetology.[21] Several thousand Tibetan exiles have now settled in the area where monasteries, temples, and schools have come up. It has become an important tourist destination with many hotels and restaurants, leading to growth in tourism and commerce.[22] In 2017, Dharamshala was made the winter capital of Himachal Pradesh with the legislative assembly located at Sidhbari.[23] Geography[edit] View of the Kangra Valley from Bhagsu Nag Dharamshala has an average elevation of 1,457 m (4,780 ft), covering an area of almost 8.51 km2 (3.29 sq mi).[24] Dharamsala is located in the Kangra Valley, in the shadow of the Dhauladhar mountains. The town is divided into two distinct sections "Lower Dharamshala" and McLeod Ganj with a narrow road surrounded by pine, Himalayan oak, and rhododendron connecting the regions.[25] Climate[edit] Dharamshala has a monsoon influenced, humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cwa). Summer begins in early April and peaks in May when temperatures can reach 36 °C (97 °F) and lasts until the start of June. From June to mid-September is the monsoon season, when up to 3,000 mm (120 inches) of rainfall can be experienced, making Dharamshala one of the wettest places in the state. Autumn is mild and lasts from October to the end of November. Autumn temperatures average around 16–17 °C (61–63 °F). Winter starts in December and continues until late February. Snow and sleet are common during the winter in upper Dharamshala (including McLeodganj, Bhagsu Nag, and Naddi). Lower Dharamshala receives little frozen precipitation except for hail. Historically, the Dhauladhar mountains used to remain snow-covered all year long; however, in recent years they have been losing their snow blanket during dry spells.[26] v t e Climate data for Dharamshala (1991–2010, extremes 1951–2011) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 24.7 (76.5) 28.0 (82.4) 31.6 (88.9) 35.6 (96.1) 38.6 (101.5) 38.6 (101.5) 42.7 (108.9) 37.8 (100.0) 34.8 (94.6) 34.6 (94.3) 26.6 (79.9) 27.2 (81.0) 42.7 (108.9) Average high °C (°F) 15.7 (60.3) 17.1 (62.8) 21.5 (70.7) 26.5 (79.7) 30.3 (86.5) 31.2 (88.2) 27.3 (81.1) 26.6 (79.9) 26.6 (79.9) 25.2 (77.4) 21.7 (71.1) 17.8 (64.0) 24.0 (75.2) Average low °C (°F) 6.0 (42.8) 7.3 (45.1) 10.9 (51.6) 15.4 (59.7) 19.1 (66.4) 20.9 (69.6) 20.0 (68.0) 19.7 (67.5) 18.0 (64.4) 14.3 (57.7) 10.3 (50.5) 7.2 (45.0) 14.1 (57.4) Record low °C (°F) −1.9 (28.6) −1.6 (29.1) 2.4 (36.3) 7.3 (45.1) 8.4 (47.1) 12.6 (54.7) 14.3 (57.7) 14.1 (57.4) 11.2 (52.2) 8.0 (46.4) 4.8 (40.6) −1.0 (30.2) −1.9 (28.6) Average rainfall mm (inches) 83.6 (3.29) 128.3 (5.05) 111.3 (4.38) 65.7 (2.59) 72.4 (2.85) 279.0 (10.98) 859.0 (33.82) 942.3 (37.10) 377.7 (14.87) 52.6 (2.07) 18.8 (0.74) 36 contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 45 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Dharamshala responseCode 3 200
