It has had many different names, formats and teams since the inaugural 1969-1970 season. Initially a knockout cup, the competition now features a single round-robin followed by a finals series. The tournament is contested between teams representing the six states of Australia, who also compete in the first-class Sheffield Shield. Three other teams have also played in the tournament for short periods of time: New Zealand's national team competed from 1969–70 until the 1974–75, Australian Capital Territory participated from 1997–98 until 1999–2000, and a select Cricket Australia XI took part as the seventh team for three seasons from 2015–16 until 2017–18. The current champions are Western Australia. History[edit] England was the first country to introduce a domestic one-day limited-overs competition with its Gillette Cup in 1963. Australia was the next country to do so when this competition was established in 1969–70. It has been held every summer since, under a wide variety of names and formats. It is a List A cricket competition. It was the first List A competition to feature numbers on player's shirts when they were introduced for the 1995–96 season and numbers were also subsequently introduced for the ODI series later in the season. In September 2017, former Australian Test cricketer Jason Gillespie suggested that Papua New Guinea should be added to the competition.[3] Seasons and competition formats[edit] 1969/70–1978/79 – Straight knockout 1979/80–1981/82 – 2 pools of 3, semi-finals, 3rd/4th playoff and final 1982/83–1991/92 – 2 pools of 3, semi-finals and final 1992/93–1999/2000 – Single round robin (i.e. home OR away), preliminary final and final 2000/01–2010/11 – Double round robin home and away plus final. 2011/12–2012/13 – Partial round robin (8 matches per team, 3 of 5 opponents played both home and away), plus final. 2013/14 – Carnival format, 6 round games, preliminary final and final. 2014/15 – Carnival format, 7 round games, preliminary final and final. 2015/16–2017/18 – Carnival format, 8 round games, preliminary final and final. 2018/19 – Single round robin, 2 qualification finals, 2 semi-finals and final. 2019/20–present – Carnival format, 7 round games and final Seasons of sponsorship and competition names[edit] 1969/70 - 1970/71 - Vehicle & General Australasian Knock-out Competition 1971/72 - 1972/73 - Coca-Cola Australasian Knock-out Competition 1973/74 - 1978/79 - Gillette Cup 1979/80 - 1987/88 - McDonald's Cup 1988/89 - 1991/92 - FAI Cup 1992/93 - 2000/01 - Mercantile Mutual Cup 2001/02 - 2005/06 - ING Cup 2006/07 - 2009/10 - Ford Ranger Cup 2010/11 - 2013/14 - Ryobi One-Day Cup 2014/15 - 2016/17 - Matador BBQs One-Day Cup 2017/18 - 2018/19 - JLT One-Day Cup 2019/20 - 2022/23 - Marsh One-Day Cup Teams[edit] Team Colour Limited-Overs Cricket Team Home Cricket Ground/s Since 1969/1970 City/Cities Est.
