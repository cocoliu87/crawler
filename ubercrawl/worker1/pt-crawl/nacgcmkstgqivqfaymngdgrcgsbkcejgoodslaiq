Writing R as <, this is stated in formal logic as: ∀ x ∈ X ∀ y ∈ X ( [ x < y ∧ ¬ ( y < x ) ∧ ¬ ( x = y ) ] ∨ [ ¬ ( x < y ) ∧ y < x ∧ ¬ ( x = y ) ] ∨ [ ¬ ( x < y ) ∧ ¬ ( y < x ) ∧ x = y ] ) . {\displaystyle \forall x\in X\,\forall y\in X\,([x<y\,\land \,\lnot (y<x)\,\land \,\lnot (x=y)]\,\lor \,[\lnot (x<y)\,\land \,y<x\,\land \,\lnot (x=y)]\,\lor \,[\lnot (x<y)\,\land \,\lnot (y<x)\,\land \,x=y])\,.} Properties[edit] A relation is trichotomous if, and only if, it is asymmetric and connected. If a trichotomous relation is also transitive, then it is a strict total order; this is a special case of a strict weak order.[2][3] Examples[edit] On the set X = {a,b,c}, the relation R = { (a,b), (a,c), (b,c) } is transitive and trichotomous, and hence a strict total order. On the same set, the cyclic relation R = { (a,b), (b,c), (c,a) } is trichotomous, but not transitive; it is even antitransitive. Trichotomy on numbers[edit] A law of trichotomy on some set X of numbers usually expresses that some tacitly given ordering relation on X is a trichotomous one. An example is the law "For arbitrary real numbers x and y, exactly one of x < y, y < x, or x = y applies"; some authors even fix y to be zero,[1] relying on the real number's additive linearly ordered group structure. The latter is a group equipped with a trichotomous order. In classical logic, this axiom of trichotomy holds for ordinary comparison between real numbers and therefore also for comparisons between integers and between rational numbers.[clarification needed] The law does not hold in general in intuitionistic logic.[citation needed] In Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory and Bernays set theory, the law of trichotomy holds between the cardinal numbers of well-orderable sets even without the axiom of choice. If the axiom of choice holds, then trichotomy holds between arbitrary cardinal numbers (because they are all well-orderable in that case).[4] See also[edit] Begriffsschrift contains an early formulation of the law of trichotomy Dichotomy Law of noncontradiction Law of excluded middle Three-way comparison References[edit] ^ a b Trichotomy Law at MathWorld ^ Jerrold E.
