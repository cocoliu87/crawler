It was launched in support of the concurrent Operation 1027 by other rebel forces in Myanmar.[4][5] Timeline[edit] 7 November[edit] It began on 7 November 2023, with junta border posts in Mese Township, Kayah State (including Pantein)[1] being seized by Karenni forces. Many weapons were seized by the rebels.[6] 70 junta soldiers were said to have been killed in the attack, while Karenni forces claimed to have incurred four dead.[1] 10 November[edit] On 10 November, the KNDF claimed they shot down a junta K-8W trainer/attack aircraft which crashed in a combat zone near Loikaw, the capital of Kayah State. However, the Tatmadaw claimed the aircraft suffered a technical problem.[7][8] 11 November[edit] Main article: Operation 1111 Starting from 4:00 AM in the morning, KNDF and KA forces started attacking military bases around Loikaw in an operation dubbed "Operation 11.11". The coalition forces captured seven military bases and shot down an aircraft.[9][10] The KNDF claimed responsibility for a Myanmar Air Force fighter jet that crashed in Eastern Kayah near Loikaw during the first day of the battle. A junta source stated that it was unclear if it crashed from enemy fire or from technical failure.[11] 15 November[edit] On 15 November, after two days of fighting, the KNDF took control of Loikaw University. At least 110 junta soldiers were killed and 38 surrendered during the fighting.[12] Due to junta retaliation strikes, more than 34 civilians were killed in Loikaw, as well as 50 being injured.[12] See also[edit] Battle of Mese Operation 1027 Mo So massacre References[edit] ^ a b c d e f CJ014, MPA (2023-11-08).
