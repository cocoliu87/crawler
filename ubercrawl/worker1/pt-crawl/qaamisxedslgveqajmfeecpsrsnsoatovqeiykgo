(July 2021) (template removal help) The Klein bottle immersed in three-dimensional space The surface of the Earth requires (at least) two charts to include every point. Here the globe is decomposed into charts around the North and South Poles. In mathematics, a manifold is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point. More precisely, an n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional manifold, or n {\displaystyle n} -manifold for short, is a topological space with the property that each point has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset of n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional Euclidean space. One-dimensional manifolds include lines and circles, but not self-crossing curves such as a figure 8. Two-dimensional manifolds are also called surfaces. Examples include the plane, the sphere, and the torus, and also the Klein bottle and real projective plane. The concept of a manifold is central to many parts of geometry and modern mathematical physics because it allows complicated structures to be described in terms of well-understood topological properties of simpler spaces. Manifolds naturally arise as solution sets of systems of equations and as graphs of functions. The concept has applications in computer-graphics given the need to associate pictures with coordinates (e.g. CT scans). Manifolds can be equipped with additional structure. One important class of manifolds are differentiable manifolds; their differentiable structure allows calculus to be done. A Riemannian metric on a manifold allows distances and angles to be measured. Symplectic manifolds serve as the phase spaces in the Hamiltonian formalism of classical mechanics, while four-dimensional Lorentzian manifolds model spacetime in general relativity. The study of manifolds requires working knowledge of calculus and topology. Motivating examples[edit] Circle[edit] Figure 1: The four charts each map part of the circle to an open interval, and together cover the whole circle. After a line, a circle is the simplest example of a topological manifold. Topology ignores bending, so a small piece of a circle is treated the same as a small piece of a line. Considering, for instance, the top part of the unit circle, x2 + y2 = 1, where the y-coordinate is positive (indicated by the yellow arc in Figure 1). Any point of this arc can be uniquely described by its x-coordinate. So, projection onto the first coordinate is a continuous and invertible mapping from the upper arc to the open interval (−1, 1): χ t o p ( x , y ) = x . {\displaystyle \chi _{\mathrm {top} }(x,y)=x.\,} Such functions along with the open regions they map are called charts. Similarly, there are charts for the bottom (red), left (blue), and right (green) parts of the circle: χ b o t t o m ( x , y ) = x χ l e f t ( x , y ) = y χ r i g h t ( x , y ) = y . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\chi _{\mathrm {bottom} }(x,y)&=x\\\chi _{\mathrm {left} }(x,y)&=y\\\chi _{\mathrm {right} }(x,y)&=y.\end{aligned}}} Together, these parts cover the whole circle, and the four charts form an atlas for the circle. The top and right charts, χ t o p {\displaystyle \chi _{\mathrm {top} }} and χ r i g h t {\displaystyle \chi _{\mathrm {right} }} respectively, overlap in their domain: their intersection lies in the quarter of the circle where both x {\displaystyle x} and y {\displaystyle y} -coordinates are positive. Both map this part into the interval ( 0 , 1 ) {\displaystyle (0,1)} , though differently. Thus a function T : ( 0 , 1 ) → ( 0 , 1 ) = χ r i g h t ∘ χ t o p − 1 {\displaystyle T:(0,1)\rightarrow (0,1)=\chi _{\mathrm {right} }\circ \chi _{\mathrm {top} }^{-1}} can be constructed, which takes values from the co-domain of χ t o p {\displaystyle \chi _{\mathrm {top} }} back to the circle using the inverse, followed by χ r i g h t {\displaystyle \chi _{\mathrm {right} }} back to the interval. If a is any number in ( 0 , 1 ) {\displaystyle (0,1)} , then: T ( a ) = χ r i g h t ( χ t o p − 1 [ a ] ) = χ r i g h t ( a , 1 − a 2 ) = 1 − a 2 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}T(a)&=\chi _{\mathrm {right} }\left(\chi _{\mathrm {top} }^{-1}\left[a\right]\right)\\&=\chi _{\mathrm {right} }\left(a,{\sqrt {1-a^{2}}}\right)\\&={\sqrt {1-a^{2}}}\end{aligned}}} Such a function is called a transition map. Figure 2: A circle manifold chart based on slope, covering all but one point of the circle. The top, bottom, left, and right charts do not form the only possible atlas. Charts need not be geometric projections, and the number of charts is a matter of choice. Consider the charts χ m i n u s ( x , y ) = s = y 1 + x {\displaystyle \chi _{\mathrm {minus} }(x,y)=s={\frac {y}{1+x}}} and χ p l u s ( x , y ) = t = y 1 − x {\displaystyle \chi _{\mathrm {plus} }(x,y)=t={\frac {y}{1-x}}} Here s is the slope of the line through the point at coordinates (x, y) and the fixed pivot point (−1, 0); similarly, t is the opposite of the slope of the line through the points at coordinates (x, y) and (+1, 0). The inverse mapping from s to (x, y) is given by x = 1 − s 2 1 + s 2 y = 2 s 1 + s 2 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x&={\frac {1-s^{2}}{1+s^{2}}}\\[5pt]y&={\frac {2s}{1+s^{2}}}\end{aligned}}} It can be confirmed that x2 + y2 = 1 for all values of s and t. These two charts provide a second atlas for the circle, with the transition map t = 1 s {\displaystyle t={\frac {1}{s}}} (that is, one has this relation between s and t for every point where s and t are both nonzero). Each chart omits a single point, either (−1, 0) for s or (+1, 0) for t, so neither chart alone is sufficient to cover the whole circle. It can be proved that it is not possible to cover the full circle with a single chart. For example, although it is possible to construct a circle from a single line interval by overlapping and "gluing" the ends, this does not produce a chart; a portion of the circle will be mapped to both ends at once, losing invertibility. Sphere[edit] The sphere is an example of a surface. The unit sphere of implicit equation x2 + y2 + z2 – 1 = 0 may be covered by an atlas of six charts: the plane z = 0 divides the sphere into two half spheres (z > 0 and z < 0), which may both be mapped on the disc x2 + y2 < 1 by the projection on the xy plane of coordinates. This provides two charts; the four other charts are provided by a similar construction with the two other coordinate planes. As with the circle, one may define one chart that covers the whole sphere excluding one point. Thus two charts are sufficient, but the sphere cannot be covered by a single chart. This example is historically significant, as it has motivated the terminology; it became apparent that the whole surface of the Earth cannot have a plane representation consisting of a single map (also called "chart", see nautical chart), and therefore one needs atlases for covering the whole Earth surface. Other curves[edit] Four manifolds from algebraic curves: ■ circles, ■ parabola, ■ hyperbola, ■ cubic. Manifolds need not be connected (all in "one piece"); an example is a pair of separate circles. Manifolds need not be closed; thus a line segment without its end points is a manifold. They are never countable, unless the dimension of the manifold is 0. Putting these freedoms together, other examples of manifolds are a parabola, a hyperbola, and the locus of points on a cubic curve y2 = x3 − x (a closed loop piece and an open, infinite piece). However, excluded are examples like two touching circles that share a point to form a figure-8; at the shared point, a satisfactory chart cannot be created. Even with the bending allowed by topology, the vicinity of the shared point looks like a "+", not a line. A "+" is not homeomorphic to a line segment, since deleting the center point from the "+" gives a space with four components (i.e. pieces), whereas deleting a point from a line segment gives a space with at most two pieces; topological operations always preserve the number of pieces. Mathematical definition[edit] Further information: Categories of manifolds Informally, a manifold is a space that is "modeled on" Euclidean space. There are many different kinds of manifolds. In geometry and topology, all manifolds are topological manifolds, possibly with additional structure. A manifold can be constructed by giving a collection of coordinate charts, that is, a covering by open sets with homeomorphisms to a Euclidean space, and patching functions[clarification needed]: homeomorphisms from one region of Euclidean space to another region if they correspond to the same part of the manifold in two different coordinate charts. A manifold can be given additional structure if the patching functions satisfy axioms beyond continuity. For instance, differentiable manifolds have homeomorphisms on overlapping neighborhoods diffeomorphic with each other, so that the manifold has a well-defined set of functions which are differentiable in each neighborhood, thus differentiable on the manifold as a whole. Formally, a (topological) manifold is a second countable Hausdorff space that is locally homeomorphic to a Euclidean space. Second countable and Hausdorff are point-set conditions; second countable excludes spaces which are in some sense 'too large' such as the long line, while Hausdorff excludes spaces such as "the line with two origins" (these generalizations of manifolds are discussed in non-Hausdorff manifolds). Locally homeomorphic to a Euclidean space means that every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset of the Euclidean space R n , {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n},} for some nonnegative integer n. This implies that either the point is an isolated point (if n = 0 {\displaystyle n=0} ), or it has a neighbo contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 42 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Manifold responseCode 3 200
