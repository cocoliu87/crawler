December 31 Tatiana the Tiger The Siberian Tiger Tatiana (pictured) escapes from her enclosure and fatally attacks three visitors at the San Francisco Zoo. --Camptown (talk) 11:24, 31 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Only one person was killed, so "fatally attacks three visitors" is inaccurate. The story is 6 days old now and not ITN worthy IMO anyways.

Kenyan presidential election, 2007 is already on ITN. --76.64.77.205 (talk) 22:57, 31 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] December 30 Mwai Kibaki, the incumbent, has been declared as the winner of the Kenyan presidential election, 2007. Julius Sahara (talk) 16:31, 30 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I strongly endorse putting this up, but I would recommend including the allegations of fraud, and Odinga claiming victory as well. AecisBrievenbus 18:06, 30 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I endorse this as a topic for ITN. How about: Mwai Kibaki is declared the winner of the Kenyan presidential election despite allegations of fraud. Perhaps the rioting should be mentioned too, although there's only one line in the article about that. There's a free picture of Kibaki available.-gadfium 19:01, 30 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I would suggest using the word "amidst" instead of "despite". AecisBrievenbus 19:49, 30 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Suprised this still isnt posted, by all means its ITN worthy, and with a good picture too. Russeasby (talk) 23:15, 30 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Posted, although I'll let someone more capable switch the photos --Stephen 23:31, 30 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] In American football, the New England Patriots go undefeated 16-0 with their victory over the Giants. This is significant for several reasons: They are the first NFL team in more than 35 years to go undefeated, and the only team in history to go 16 and 0. Along the way, they have set several significant team records (most points scored by a team, most touchdowns scored by a team, highest point differential and more) and individual records (most touchdown passes in a season by Brady and Moss and more). On top of all of that, it was broadcast in a historic (and unprecedented for any sporting event) three network simulcast (NBC and CBS - plus several non NBC/CBS local affiliates - carried the NFL Network's feed). A ton of significant information that should be in ITN, but I stumped on the wording and how much of this to include, so I'll leave suggestions to others. --Edward Morgan Blake (talk) 04:21, 30 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I agree that this is a momentous and historic event in American sport. I'll add it to the template shortly, and if you (or anyone else) have any comments and suggestions about a tweak to my blurb, please let me know, as some of my previous entries have been a bit off in terms of the manual of style that is generally used here. gaillimhConas tá tú? 05:41, 30 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Haha, I'm happy to implement your suggestion, either way is fine with me. In fact, I actually just basically copied and pasted your since-removed suggestion onto the template itself, so just let me know which version you think is better; I'm fine either way gaillimhConas tá tú? 05:55, 30 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] The new one is great. (But what do I know, heehee). --Edward Morgan Blake (talk) 05:58, 30 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Haha, cheers gaillimhConas tá tú? 05:59, 30 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Since this is now up (and I myself have been involved in some of these debates regarding sports on ITN that are now archived) my question is how long it this is going to take before some non-American Wikipedians (perhaps many) start complaining that it should be removed because it is not a championship or is not significantly international news, or why similar records in other sports are never included, etc. Good luck... Zzyzx11 (Talk) 06:07, 30 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Well, I hope I did a good job communicating the significance of what has occurred above. A few weeks ago there was a cricket thing in ITN... so if our friends across the pond need some reference, imagine a football (soccer) team in one of the top leagues going undefeated (assuming that such a feat is as rare in soccer as it is in American football), and the ultimate game being shown simultaneously on Sky Sports, BBC1, and ITV, with international media coverage, and the team shattering a half dozen records. It's certainly a big deal in the sport of American football, in North America in general, and according to at least one reporter at a post game press conference, Japan (go figure). --Edward Morgan Blake (talk) 06:20, 30 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Such a feat is very rare in football (soccer). It happened once in Brazil (Flamengo, I think it was), Arsenal achieved it once or twice in England and Ajax achieved it once or twice in the Netherlands. AecisBrievenbus 13:01, 30 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Hasn't Arsenal FC did this before? They had draws/ties though. This can't be compared with soccer since several teams compete in several competitions (league+cup+continental competition) at the same time so having an undefeated season is impossible. Anyway I don't think this is ITN material, since the Pats haven't really accomplished anything yet (unless the NFL gives them a trophy or something, but not cash). If they win 3 more times then they can should be posted at the ITN. --Howard the Duck 17:33, 30 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I agree. This isn't ITN worthy if you ask me. - Shudde talk 22:39, 30 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] As an Australian who often argues against American national sport being on in the news, I actually don't have a problem with this, and think it is quite interesting news (even for someone like me who has no idea or knowledge about anything gridiron related). However, I must say if something like this were to happen in, say, the Australian Football League, it wouldn't have a mention (for example, the results of the Superbowl were put up on the main page, but the results of the AFL Grand Final weren't, despite me suggesting it). I'm a big football fan, but I would argue against inclusion here. I'd rather include the BCS National Championship Game result on Jan. 7 and wait for the Super Bowl for our NFL mention. -- Mwalcoff (talk) 18:07, 30 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I agree with this. With 2 big american football stories we know will be coming in the next ~5 weeks, having this regular season story seems a bit like overkill. --W.marsh 20:13, 30 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Agree with the above. Generally, I am not a sports fan and would rather not see any sports related items ITN, but I realize I am in the minority on that. But really, I think this is a bit excessive. I do get annoyed with the anti baseball/american football arguments in general, but they have a point on this one. Russeasby (talk) 23:15, 30 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I don't think the threshold for ITN should ever be X ammount of stories per Y time period relating to a specific subject. This is notable on its own merits or its not. If a lot of countries had their elections during the same few weeks, would that mean that we should not include all of them? This isn't just some random sports record either. It's the biggest team record in the most popular sport in the US, where the vast majority of native speakers live. It's been done for the first time in 35 years. It matters. Grant.alpaugh (talk) 05:48, 31 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] The majority of speakers part isn't a valid arguement. If it was, every American thing would get on ITN. And, somehow, I don't see this happening if a CFL team went undefeated next year, which would be the first time in sixty years. --Plasma Twa 2 (talk) 06:39, 31 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] The fact that the US is where the majority of native speakers live is a valid argument. This is an encyclopedia for English users, and primarily for native speakers. This isn't the Simple English Wikipedia. Either way the US is one of the largest (if not the largest) demographics of English speakers on the planet, so the most popular sport to them is by default a popular sport for English speakers. This is a major record in this sport. It's notability was well articulated by the first poster. Millions of people in the UK, Canada, Japan, and other countries follow the NFL. I can't for the life of me see what the problem is. I promise you that if one of the Premiership (either football or rugby union) teams finished the league undefeated and undrawn you'd be all about posting it. Also, the idea that every American story gets posted is absolutely ridiculous. Every notable American item gets posted just like every other country in the world. Grant.alpaugh (talk) 17:59, 31 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Now, I think it's gotten to the point where any sports accomplishment in a top league will be suggested for ITN. When another sports team goes undefeated, there will be a lot more resistance then this one cause it's not NFL. And you didn't listen to me, did you? I said that, if ITN did have an American bias due to population, then everything would get on. And Don't twist my words, thank you. --Plasma Twa 2 (talk) 19:21, 31 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I'm also an American football fan, and I think this should only have been mentioned if they won the Super Bowl.--Boznia 01:09, 31 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] No argument from m contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 80 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Wikipedia:In_the_news/Candidates/December_2007 responseCode 3 200
