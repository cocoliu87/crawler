Archives 1, 2 Nationality[edit] it is not accurate or meaningul to claim godel was austrian..in fact for most of his life he would have have answered questions about his nationality with "american." if you asked gim about his ethnicity or ancestey he would have stated "german." godel was not "austrian" would never have said he was "austrian " and never considered himself "austrian" — Preceding unsigned comment added by 50.36.86.173 (talk • contribs) 16:31, 26 December 2019 (UTC)Reply[reply] I did think about whether the section that introduces this article should state his nationality. However, reading this article I see this could be difficult - the article says that he was born in part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, now in the Czech republic, to a German family. Vorbee (talk) 21:57, 9 December 2020 (UTC)Reply[reply] Not worth it. His nationality is irrelevant to his work. Really we should drop the habit more generally of leading with nationality, but especially in a case like this, where it's complicated and the complications become an edit-war temptation for nationalists. Just let it be. His nationality is "mathematician". --Trovatore (talk) 23:16, 9 December 2020 (UTC)Reply[reply] Just came to say that I was happy to not see any nationality claim in the introduction. IMO Wikipedia should refrain from the habit of writing about nationalities in the first sentence. So, bravo 131.176.243.9 (talk) 13:32, 17 October 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] Very clearly, Kurt Gödel was Austrian. When he was born in 1906 in Brno, the city lay in Austria-Hungary, more precisely in Cisleithania. There was no Austro-Hungarian citizenship in Austria-Hungary. One was either Austrian (in Cisleithania), or Hungarian (in Transleithania). Kurt Gödel therefore had the Austrian citizenship. In 1918, Brno became Czechoslovakian. The German-speaking inhabitants of Czechoslovakia were later referred to as Sudeten Germans and almost the entirety of them was expelled from Czechoslovakia to Germany and Austria (the German-speaking inhabitants of Brno almost entirely to Austria) in 1945 and 1946. In 1929, Kurt Gödel renounced the Czechoslovakian citizenship and became Austrian again. Furthermore, the article tells us, that Kurt Gödel considered himself Austrian and that he studied at the University of Vienna. It is therefore completely correct to refer to him as - if not Austrian - at least Austrian-born. Viennese97 (talk) 13:57, 1 May 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Cisleithania was a nonformal term. Godel is definitelly Moravian-born or Czech-born, because he was born and spent his childhood in Moravia and had Czech citizenship. I don't understand why among the citizeships of Godel is German, when he obtained German citizenship? I don't understand why you talk about Sudeten Germans, that's a term invented by Nazis to justify anexion of the Czechia. After war the term was forbidden by law and Godel wasn't in Czechia long time before WWII and it's not true that all German-speaking inhabitants were expelled, Czech Jews for example we're also mainly German-speaking and my German speaking Jew grandmother wasn't expelled. Czechia was historically multiethnic country, but after WWII it was unimaginable, that Czechs would live with Germans peacefully in one state. 46.135.96.236 (talk) 09:20, 2 May 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] He can't be Czech-born because he was born in 1906 in Austria-Hungary with the Austrian citizenship, and not in the Czech Republic. He only got the Czech citizenship in 1918. But he didn't want it, and renounced it, and got the Austrian citizenship again. Second, he did not want to be Czechoslovakian because he neither spoke Czech nor Slovakian, but German. And German Bohemians and Moravians are Austrian and not Czech.
