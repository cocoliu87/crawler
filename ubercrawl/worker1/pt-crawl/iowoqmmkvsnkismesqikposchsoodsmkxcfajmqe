The station is on the East–West, North East and Thomson–East Coast lines, and is located near the junction of Outram Road, Eu Tong Sen Street and New Bridge Road on the boundary of Bukit Merah and Outram planning areas. It is the closest MRT station to Singapore General Hospital, the Police Cantonment Complex, Outram Community Hospital and the Health Promotion Board. The station was included in the early plans of the MRT network in 1982; it was constructed a part of the Phase I MRT segment from Novena, and was due to be completed by December 1987. Before plans for the line were extended to the World Trade Center, the station was originally the terminus of the North-East line. When the Thomson–East Coast Line opened on 13 November 2022, Outram Park station became a triple-line interchange, joining Marina Bay and Dhoby Ghaut stations. History[edit] Construction and East–West Line[edit] EWL platforms Outram Park station was included in early plans of the MRT network in May 1982.[1] It was to be constructed as part of the Phase I MRT segment from Novena station;[2] the segment was due to be completed by December 1987.[3] The segment was given priority because it transits areas with a higher demand for public transport, such as the densely populated housing estates of Toa Payoh and Ang Mo Kio, and the Central Area. The line was intended to relieve traffic congestion on the Thomson–Sembawang Road corridor.[4][5] The contract for the construction of Outram Park station and 4 km (2.5 mi) of tunnels between the Tiong Bahru and Maxwell (now Tanjong Pagar) stations was awarded to a Japanese joint venture Ohbayashi-Gumi/Okumura Corporation in November 1983 at a cost of S$73.85 million (US$95 million in 2020).[6][7] During the station's construction, Outram Primary School was relocated.[8] A slip road from Outram Road to Eu Tong Sen Street was closed and sewer pipes were moved.[9][10] The tunnel from Outram Park to Tiong Bahru was scheduled to be completed in September 1984.[11] Train services commenced on 12 December 1987, when the line extension to the station was officially completed. The station was part of a line service that continuously ran from Yishun station in the north to Lakeside station in the west.[12][13] From 28 October 1989, Outram Park station began to serve the East–West Line (EWL) with the operational split of the MRT system.[14][a] North East line[edit] NEL platforms Preliminary studies for the North East Line (NEL) in 1986 included plans to terminate that line at Outrram Park station rather than HarbourFront station.[16] In a 1995 study, plans for the NEL were extended to serve the World Trade Centre.[17] After the government approved plans for the new line in January 1996,[18] communications minister Mah Bow Tan announced in March 1996 the station would interchange with the NEL.[19] In September 2000, construction of lift access in the station began. EWL station upgrades were completed on 12 October 2002. [20] On 14 August 2017, Two meeting points called Heart Zones were designated near the EWL and NEL exits to better assist the elderly.[21] Thomson–East Coast line[edit] TEL platforms On 29 August 2012, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) announced Outram Park station would interchange with the proposed Thomson Line.[22][23] At the same time, the Singapore Land Authority announced the acquisition of Pearls Centre, giving residents three years to vacate the premises to facilitate tunneling works under the complex.[24][25] On 15 August 2014, the LTA announced the Thomson Line would be integrated into the Thomson–East Coast Line (TEL). The TEL platform at Outram Park would be constructed as part of Phase 3, consisting of 13 stations between Mount Pleasant and Gardens by the Bay.[26][27] On 9 March 2022, Transport Minister S Iswaran announced in Parliament Stage 3 (Caldecott to Gardens by the Bay via Napier) would open in the second half of 2022.[28] Following the opening of the Thomson–East Coast Line on 13 November 2022, Outram Park station became a triple-line interchange, joining Marina Bay and Dhoby Ghaut stations.[29] Contract T220 for the design and construction of Outram Park TEL platform and associated tunnels was awarded to Daelim Industrial Co. Ltd at a cost of S$301 million in May 2014. Construction started in 2014 with completion expected in 2021.[30] To facilitate the construction of the TEL station, a temporary pedestrian overhead bridge had to be removed and a road had to be diverted. The TEL train tunnels were built near existing EWL tunnels; they were tested and monitored for structural integrity during construction. In tandem with the TEL station's opening, a new underpass was opened to allow commuters to cross Orchard Road.[31] To facilitate the construction of a new linkway between the NEL and TEL, the linkway between the EWL and NEL was closed and replaced with a new one on 29 May 2023.[32] On 7 October 2022, during a visit by Transport Minister S. Iswaran to Outram Park and Maxwell stations, it was announced the TEL platform would began operations on 13 November that year.[33][34] Incidents[edit] On 6 March 2008 in the NEL section of the station, a police officer shot a man who had threatened him with a knife. The man had already stabbed a person to death at a coffee shop in Jalan Kukoh. Four platform central screen doors in the direction of HarbourFront were affected due to a police cordon, which lasted two hours, and passengers were required to use other doors to board and alight trains; train services were otherwise unaffected.[35] A coroner's inquiry into the man's death ruled the shooting was a case of justifiable homicide and a district judge ruled the shooting was without any criminal intent.[36] Details[edit] Location[edit] Outram Park MRT station is located near the junction of Outram Road, Eu Tong Sen Street and New Bridge Road on the boundary of Bukit Merah and Outram planning areas.[37] The station serves several health facilities, such as Singapore General Hospital, the National Cancer Centre,[38][39] the Health Sciences Authority, Outram Community Hospital and the Health Promotion Board; schools such as Cantonment Primary School and Outram Secondary School;[40] and the Police Cantonment Complex.[41][42] Services[edit] Outram Park station is an interchange station on the EWL, the NEL and the TEL. Its code is EW16/NE3/TE17.[41][43] On the EWL, the station is located between Tanjong Pagar and Tiong Bahru stations.[44] As of June 2023[update], EWL trains operate in both directions every 2–5 minutes from approximately 6:00 a.m. (6:25 a.m. on Sundays and public holidays) to 12:00 a.m.[45] On the NEL, the station is located between HarbourFront and Chinatown stations.[44] As of June 2023[update], NEL trains operate in both directions every 2–5 minutes from approximately 6:10 a.m. for services fo HarbourFront, 6:00 am for services towards Punggol (6:30 am on Sundays and public holidays for both directions) to 12:00 a.m.[45] On the TEL, the station is located between Havelock and Maxwell stations,[44] with headways of 5–6 minutes[46] from approximately 6:00 a.m. (6:25 a.m. on Sundays and public holidays) to 12:00 a.m. towards Gardens by the Bay.
