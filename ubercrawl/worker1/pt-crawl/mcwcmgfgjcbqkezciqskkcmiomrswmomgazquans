The alliance of intelligence operations is also known as the Five Eyes.[3][4][5] In classification markings this is abbreviated as FVEY, with the individual countries being abbreviated as AUS, CAN, NZL, GBR, and USA, respectively. Emerging from an informal agreement related to the 1941 Atlantic Charter, the secret treaty was renewed with the passage of the 1943 BRUSA Agreement, before being officially enacted on 5 March 1946 by the United Kingdom and the United States. In the following years, it was extended to encompass Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Other countries, known as "third parties", such as West Germany, the Philippines, and several Nordic countries, also joined the UKUSA community in associate capacities, although they are not part of the mechanism for automatic sharing of intelligence that exists between the Five Eyes.[6] Much of the sharing of information is performed via the ultra-sensitive STONEGHOST network, which has been claimed to contain "some of the Western world's most closely guarded secrets".[7] Besides laying down rules for intelligence sharing, the agreement formalized and cemented the "Special Relationship" between the UK and the US.[8] Due to its status as a secret treaty, its existence was not known to the Prime Minister of Australia until 1973,[9] and it was not disclosed to the public until 2005.[10] On 25 June 2010, for the first time in history, the full text of the agreement was publicly released by the United Kingdom and the United States, and can now be viewed online.[11] Shortly after its release, the seven-page UKUSA Agreement was recognized by Time magazine as one of the Cold War's most important documents, with immense historical significance.[10] The global surveillance disclosure by Edward Snowden has shown that the intelligence-sharing activities between the First World allies of the Cold War are rapidly shifting into the digital realm of the Internet.[12][13] History[edit] Origins (1940s–1950s)[edit] The parties agree to the exchange of the products of the following operations relating to foreign communications:- Collection of traffic. Acquisition of communications documents and equipment. Traffic analysis. Cryptanalysis. Decryption and translation. Acquisition of information regarding communications organizations, procedures, practices and equipment. —AMENDMENT NO. 4 TO THE APPENDICES TO THE UKUSA AGREEMENT (THIRD EDITION), page 5 The agreement originated from a ten-page 1943 British–US Communication Intelligence Agreement, BRUSA.[14] The UKUSA Agreement connected the signal intercept networks of the UK Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and the US National Security Agency (NSA) at the beginning of the Cold War.[15] The document was signed on 5 March 1946 by Colonel Patrick Marr-Johnson for the UK's London Signals Intelligence Board and Lieutenant General Hoyt Vandenberg for the US State–Army–Navy Communication Intelligence Board. Although the original agreement states that the exchange would not be "prejudicial to national interests", the United States often blocked information sharing from Commonwealth countries. The full text of the agreement was released to the public on 25 June 2010.[16] The "Five Eyes" term has its origins as a shorthand for a "AUS/CAN/NZ/UK/US EYES ONLY" classification level.[17] Onset of the Cold War (1950s–1960s)[edit] Under the agreement, the GCHQ and the NSA shared intelligence on the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and several Eastern Bloc countries (known as Exotics).[18] The network was expanded in the 1960s into the Echelon collection and analysis network.[8] The treaty was extended to include Canada (1948), Australia (1956) and New Zealand (1956). In 1955, the agreement was updated to designate Canada, Australia and New Zealand as "UKUSA-collaborating Commonwealth countries".[16] Other countries that joined as "third parties" were Norway (1952), Denmark (1954) and West Germany (1955). Investigations (1970–90s)[edit] In the aftermath of the 1973 Murphy raids on the headquarters of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), the existence of the UKUSA Agreement was revealed to Australia's Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. After learning about the agreement, Whitlam discovered that Pine Gap, a secret surveillance station close to Alice Springs, Northern Territory, had been operated by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).[19][20][21][22] At the height of the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, the use and control of Pine Gap by the CIA was strongly opposed by Whitlam, who fired the chief of the ASIO before being dismissed as prime minister.[23] The existence of several intelligence agencies of the Five Eyes was not revealed until the following years: 1974 In Canada, an investigative television report on CBC News's newsmagazine program The Fifth Estate revealed the existence of the Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC).[24][25] 1975 In the United States, the Church Committee of the Senate revealed the existence of the National Security Agency (NSA).[26][27] 1976 In Britain, an investigative article in Time Out magazine revealed the existence of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ).[28] 1977 In Australia, the Hope Commission revealed the existence of Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) and the Defence Signals Directorate (DSD).[29] 1980 In New Zealand, the existence of the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) was officially disclosed on a "limited basis".[30] In 1999, the Australian government acknowledged that it "does co-operate with counterpart signals intelligence organisations overseas under the UKUSA relationship."[31][32] The existence of the UKUSA Agreement, however, was not publicly revealed until 2005.[10] The contents of the agreement were officially disclosed to the public on 25 June 2010. Four days later, the agreement was described by Time magazine as one of the "most important documents in the history of the Cold War."[10] Recent media leaks[edit] In July 2013, as part of the 2013 Edward Snowden revelations, it emerged that the NSA is paying GCHQ for its services, with at least £100 million of payments made between 2010 and 2013.[33] On 11 September 2013, The Guardian released a leaked document provided by Edward Snowden which reveals a similar agreement between the NSA and Israel's Unit 8200.[34] According to The Sydney Morning Herald, Australia operates clandestine surveillance facilities at its embassies "without the knowledge of most Australian diplomats". These facilities are part of an international espionage program known as STATEROOM.[35] Security and intelligence agencies[edit] Although the UKUSA alliance is often associated with the ECHELON system, processed intelligence is reliant on multiple sources of information and the intelligence shared is not restricted to signals intelligence. The following table provides an overview of the government agencies involved and their respective responsibilities within the "Five Eyes" community:[17] Country Signals intelligence Defence intelligence Security intelligence Human intelligence United Kingdom Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) Defence Intelligence (DI) Security Service a.k.a. MI5 Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) a.k.a.

Five Eyes[edit] Main article: Five Eyes The Five Eyes (often abbreviated as FVEY) are an intelligence alliance comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. These countries are bound by the multilateral UKUSA Agreement, a treaty for joint cooperation in signals intelligence.[17][36] Australia[edit] Australia monitors South Asia and East Asia.[17] Canada[edit] Canada's geographical proximity to the Soviet Union provided considerable eavesdropping advantages during the Cold War. Canada continues to monitor the Russian and Chinese interior while managing intelligence assets in Latin America.[17] New Zealand[edit] The Waihopai Valley Facility – base of the New Zealand branch of the ECHELON Program In addition to Southeast Asia, New Zealand is responsible for the western Pacific[17] and maintains listening posts in the South Island at Waihopai Valley just south-west of Blenheim, and on the North Island at Tangimoana. United Kingdom[edit] Europe, European Russia, Middle East, and Hong Kong.[17] United States[edit] The US is focused on the Middle East, Russia, and China, in addition to the Caribbean and Africa.[17] 9 Eyes, 14 Eyes, and other "third parties"[edit] See also: Fourteen Eyes, a section in Five Eyes article This diagram depicts the relationship between the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the so-called "s contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 49 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/UKUSA_Agreement responseCode 3 200
