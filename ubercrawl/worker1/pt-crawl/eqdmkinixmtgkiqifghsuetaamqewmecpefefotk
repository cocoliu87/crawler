SandyGeorgia (Talk) 15:15, 21 July 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] Add FAQ ?[edit] Should the Main Page FAQ subsection be added here as a See also link? SandyGeorgia (Talk) 12:01, 18 July 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] My opinion is that it is too long, not only about FAs, the verbosity in it should be trimmed, and it is unlikely to be read. The idea here was to keep it short and readable. Not sure that a See also link would do any harm, though. SandyGeorgia (Talk) 12:03, 18 July 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] I think some sort of link may be useful. Especially since the current text is If you would like to see a new subject featured on the Main Page... Unless there is some other guide about how to get content on the MP in general (that is not just via TFA, but via OTD, ITN, DYK, etc)? A one liner like: See also: Frequently Asked Questions about the main page. Not as a hat note, just in the bottom of the text section. That FAQ could link back here where relevant as well. — xaosflux Talk 14:45, 18 July 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] Add info on general assessment[edit] Over at the main page discussion, User:Darcyisverycute has suggested adding another bit, which I would suggest be added to See also at the bottom of the page: See also: How Wikipedia articles are graded and assessed." SandyGeorgia (Talk) 19:40, 20 July 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] Thanks SandyGeorgia :) I think it looks good in its current state- easy to understand, helping interested users navigate as well. Darcyisverycute (talk) 07:23, 21 July 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] Too much[edit] I think that there's (still) too much. I would be happy to see the {{FApages}} content shrunk to just the first section (FA, FL, etc.). What do you think about something this short and simple? About Today's featured article Featured content: Featured articles Featured lists Featured pictures Featured topics Today's featured article (TFA) for this month This star symbolizes the featured content on Wikipedia. Featured articles (FAs) are some of the best articles at the English Wikipedia. They are written by volunteers about subjects of their own choosing, and evaluated by other volunteers against the featured article criteria. Each day, Today's featured article coordinators select one of the FAs to be featured on Wikipedia's main page. If you would like to see a new subject featured on the Main Page, you can learn about contributing to Wikipedia. See also Frequently Asked Questions about the main page How Wikipedia articles are graded and assessed The less on the page, the more of what's there might get read. WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:17, 20 July 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] I agree ... just wanted to get something started ... will do now ... SandyGeorgia (Talk) 20:35, 20 July 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] PS I suspect we may have to repeatedly remind people the intent of this page, which is why I added a link to the initial discussions at the top of this talk page; we want to keep this very short and simple, aimed at new/starting readers who don't understand how something comes to be featured on the main page ... we don't need all the extra links to the gory detail. SandyGeorgia (Talk) 20:38, 20 July 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] Your slightly pessimistic view is probably right. There's always room for my cow on the commons... WhatamIdoing (talk) 23:36, 20 July 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] Volunteers[edit] Back to the "no one's in charge" issue (relative to other kinds of website featured articles), should we add the word volunteer to this line? Each day, Today's featured article coordinators select one of the FAs to be featured on Wikipedia's main page. Becomes: Each day, Today's featured article volunteer coordinators select one of the FAs to be featured on Wikipedia's main page. SandyGeorgia (Talk) 20:56, 20 July 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] For someone that has no idea what this is and is coming in from the outside - "What is a FAC?" Where do they come from? Can I be one? I think the only real mention of that volunteer role is in Wikipedia:Featured article candidates - that simply mentions that it exists, but not what it is - etc. — xaosflux Talk 22:11, 20 July 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] Perhaps something like "Volunteer coordinators select one FA per day to become Wikipedia:Today's featured article"? My thought was that splitting "TFAVC" into two parts ("VC" and "TFA") might make the sentence simpler. It might be even easier if we lose the "coordinator" title, and say "some of the English Wikipedia's volunteers select..." or "designated volunteers select..." WhatamIdoing (talk) 23:34, 20 July 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] I prefer the latter (designated volunteers select); Xaosflux does that work for you? SandyGeorgia (Talk) 23:38, 20 July 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] Ps, the reason I prefer that is it hints at the community consensus about their appointment. SandyGeorgia (Talk) 23:43, 20 July 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] @SandyGeorgia I'm fine with any of them. It doesn't really excuse that we don't have anything anywhere (except perhaps the deep archives of WT:FAC) that says what coordinators are, how they are selected, etc. I don't think all that detail belongs on this page at all, but it should probably be somewhere. — xaosflux Talk 23:47, 20 July 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] How's this? I de-emphasized the "one per day" a tad because there have been exceptions, albeit rare. SandyGeorgia (Talk) 00:01, 21 July 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] Donate to Wikipedia[edit] There are many worthy entities which provide a great service to the public—wiki is one of them. I would like to donate to wiki but indirectly so my personal and financial info will not be compromised. If Wiki were registered on Amazon.com’s charity list, I would donate annually. I used Wikipedia several times a day and appreciate the ability to obtain reliable information on almost any topic that I’m curious about. 75.118.64.13 (talk) 19:17, 16 December 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] Hi IP! Try searching for "the Wikimedia Foundation" on Amazon Smile; you can select it there. FWIW, I don't think Wikipedia stores any info on donors (that's why the pop-ups don't go away after you donate) and I'd consider it a far more trustworthy data steward than Amazon. {{u|Sdkb}} talk 20:02, 16 December 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] Help request[edit] Hello! I'm an admin in the Albanian Wikipedia. Can someone help me set up a system similar to this feature in there? We already have a rather outdated system about "article of the week" and we'd like to update it accordingly to use a similar "infrastructure" as the one utilized here but I'm not sure about all the (sub)pages that make such a thing possible (templates, categories, etc.) We may also need to update our main page code to accommodate for such a change. Can someone guide me in this process? - Klein Muçi (talk) 08:56, 15 January 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] What does "at the English Wikipedia" mean?[edit] From the article: "Featured articles (FAs) are some of the best articles at the English Wikipedia. They are written by volunteers about subjects of their own choosing, and evaluated by other volunteers against the featured article criteria." What does this mean? Is this a grammatical error? 174.61.145.205 (talk) 22:44, 2 February 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Hi 174., I think I'm missing something - exactly which article are you seeing that phrase on? — xaosflux Talk 23:31, 2 February 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Disregard, it was here on the associated project page - I changed 'at' to 'in'. — xaosflux Talk 23:33, 2 February 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] did the FA not switch over?[edit] I checked on 2 browsers on my phone and I think it's still Taylor Swift which was yesterday's too? I think the DYK switched. I'm not sure the correct place to report this, or how time zones work, but FYI jengod (talk) 01:23, 15 September 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Jengod, the Taylor Swift song is the current FA. It was just posted early because the previous one had some BLP concerns and got pulled. Thebiguglyalien (talk) 01:43, 15 September 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] I, for one, welcome our new Taylor Swiftian overlords. (No seriously thanks for replying and explaining, Alien. Appreciate it.) jengod (talk) 01:48, 15 September 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 81 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:About_Today%27s_featured_article responseCode 3 200
