Though the president is the chief executive of the government of Myanmar, the 2008 Constitution reserves certain important executive powers for the NDSC and certain actions of the president require approval by the NDSC. Of the 11 members, the commander-in-chief appoints 5 members and controls 6 votes, guaranteeing the Tatmadaw (military) permanent control of a key part of the executive branch regardless of election results.[1][2][3] The military reports directly to the NDSC, effectively making the military unaccountable.[4] The NDSC's existence is enshrined in Chapter V of the Constitution of Myanmar,[5] and it was formed on 31 March 2011.[6][1] After President Win Myint refused to call a meeting of the NDSC to address the Tatmadaw’s baseless allegations of massive voter fraud in the 2020 general election, the military under the leadership of Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing executed a coup on 1 February 2021, removing Win Myint and installing Myint Swe as Acting President so he could call a meeting of the NDSC and transfer state power to Min Aung Hlaing. The NDSC has since continued to serve as the purported basis of legitimacy for Min Aung Hlaing’s military dictatorship.[7] The NDSC's constitutionally enshrined roles include expansive powers: Recommend pardonees for the President to grant amnesty[5][8] Approve the President's act of severing foreign diplomatic relations[5] Coordinate with the President to take military action against aggressors[5] Approve the Tatmadaw's ability to conscript citizens[5] Nominate a candidate for Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services, to be appointed by the president[5] Coordinate with the President in declaring a state of emergency[5] Exercise legislative, executive and judiciary powers during a state of emergency[5] Exercise sovereign power during a state of emergency[5] Members[edit] According to the Constitution, NDSC's membership must consist of the following individuals: President First Vice-President Second Vice-President Speaker of the Pyithu Hluttaw Speaker of the Amyotha Hluttaw Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Deputy Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Minister of Defence Minister of Foreign Affairs Minister of Home Affairs Minister of Border Affairs National Defence and Security Council of Myint Swe (2021–present)[edit] Position Name Acting President and First Vice President Myint Swe Second Vice President Henry Van Thio Speaker of the House of Representatives T Khun Myat Speaker of the House of Nationalities Vacant Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Min Aung Hlaing Deputy Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Soe Win Minister of Defence Mya Tun Oo (2021–2023) Tin Aung San (2023–present) Minister of Home Affairs Soe Htut (2021–2023) Yar Pyae (2023–present) Minister of Foreign Affairs Wunna Maung Lwin (2021–2023) Than Swe (2023–present) Minister of Border Affairs Tun Tun Naung National Defence and Security Council of Win Myint (2018–2021)[edit] Position Name President Win Myint First Vice President Myint Swe Second Vice President Henry Van Thio Speaker of the House of Representatives of Myanmar T Khun Myat Speaker of the House of Nationalities Mahn Win Khaing Than Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Min Aung Hlaing Deputy Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Soe Win Minister of Defence Sein Win Minister of Home Affairs Kyaw Swe (2018 - 2020) Soe Htut(2020 - 2021) Minister of Foreign Affairs Aung San Suu Kyi Minister of Border Affairs Ye Aung National Defence and Security Council of Htin Kyaw (2016–2018)[edit] Position Name President Htin Kyaw First Vice President Myint Swe Second Vice President Henry Van Thio Speaker of the House of Representatives of Myanmar Win Myint Speaker of the House of Nationalities Mahn Win Khaing Than Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing Armed Forces Deputy Commander-in-Chief Soe Win Minister of Defence Sein Win Minister of Home Affairs Kyaw Swe Minister of Foreign Affairs Aung San Suu Kyi Minister of Border Affairs Ye Aung National Defence and Security Council of Thein Sein (2011–2016)[edit] As of 9 July 2013, NDSC was composed of the following members:[9][10][11] Position Name President Thein Sein First Vice President Tin Aung Myint Oo(2011–2012) Sai Mauk Kham(2012–2016) Second Vice President Sai Mauk Kham(2011–2012) Nyan Tun(2012–2016) Speaker of the Pyithu Hluttaw Shwe Mann Speaker of the Amyotha Hluttaw Khin Aung Myint Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing Armed Forces Deputy Commander-in-Chief Soe Win Minister of Defence Hla Min(2011–2012) Wai Lwin(2012–2015) Sein Win(2015–2016) Minister of Home Affairs Ko Ko Minister of Foreign Affairs Wunna Maung Lwin Minister of Border Affairs Thein Htay (2011–2013) Thet Naing Win(2013–2015) Kyaw Swe(2015–2016) References[edit] ^ a b Htun Aung Gyaw (21 February 2014).
