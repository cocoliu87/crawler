Chennai (/ˈtʃɛnaɪ/ ⓘ, Tamil: [ˈt͡ɕenːaɪ̯], IAST: Cennaī), formerly known as Madras,[a] is the capital city of Tamil Nadu, the southernmost state of India. It is the state's primate city both in area and population and is located on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal. According to the 2011 Indian census, Chennai is the sixth-most populous city in India and forms the fourth-most populous urban agglomeration. Incorporated in 1866, the Greater Chennai Corporation is the oldest municipal corporation of India and the second oldest in the world after London. Historically, Chennai and surroundings were part of the Chola, Pandya, Pallava and Vijayanagara kingdoms for many centuries. The coastal land, which then contained the fishing village Madrasapattinam, was purchased by the British East India Company from the Nayak ruler Damarla Chennapa Nayaka, in the 17th century. The British garrison established the Madras city and port, and built Fort St. George—the first British fortress in India—which the French won over briefly in 1746, before becoming the winter capital of the Madras Presidency, a colonial province of the British Raj in the Indian subcontinent. After India gained its independence in 1947, Madras continued as the capital city of the Madras State and present-day Tamil Nadu. The city was officially renamed as Chennai in 1996. The city is coterminous with Chennai district, which together with the adjoining suburbs constitutes the Chennai Metropolitan Area,[b] the 36th-largest urban area in the world by population[27] and one of the largest metropolitan economies of India. As the traditional and de facto gateway of South India,[1][2][3][4] Chennai is among the most-visited Indian cities by foreigners. It was ranked the 43rd most-visited city in the world in 2015 and 36th in 2019.[28][29] The Quality of Living Survey rates it as India's safest city.[30] Chennai attracts 45 percent of health tourists visiting India, and 30 to 40 percent of domestic health tourists.[31] As such, it is termed "India's health capital".[32][33] Chennai has the fifth-largest urban economy,[34] and had the third-largest expatriate population in India.[35][36] Ranked as a beta-level city in the Global Cities Index,[37] Chennai was dubbed India's best city by India Today in 2014.[38][39] It was named the "hottest" city (city worth visiting and worth living in for long term) by the BBC in 2015, citing its amalgam of both modern and traditional values.[40] It was the only South Asian city to be ranked among National Geographic's "Top 10 food cities" in 2015,[41] and ranked ninth on Lonely Planet's best cosmopolitan cities of the world.[42] In October 2017, Chennai was added to the UNESCO Creative Cities Network (UCCN) list for its rich musical tradition.[43] Chennai hosts more than one-third of India's automobile industry, and is a major film production center, home to the Tamil-language film industry. Etymology See also: Names of Chennai in different languages The name Chennai was derived from the name of Damarla Mudirasa Chennappa Nayakudu, father of Damarla Venkatapathy Nayak, a Nayak ruler who served as a general under Venkata III of the Vijayanagara Empire from whom the British East India Company acquired the town in 1639.[44][45] As such, the city's name is of Telugu language origin.[46][47][48] The first official use of the name Chennai is said to be in a sale deed, dated August 1639, to Francis Day of the East India Company, even before[49] the Chennakesava Perumal Temple was built in 1646,[50] while some scholars argue to the contrary.[51] The name Madras is also of native origin, and has been shown to have been in use before the British established a presence in India.[52] A Vijayanagara-era inscription dated to the year 1367 that mentions the port of Mādarasanpattanam, along with other small ports on the east coast, was discovered in 2015 and it was theorised that the aforementioned port is the fishing port of Royapuram.[53] According to some sources, Madras is derived from Madraspattinam, a fishing village north of Fort St George.[54] However, it is uncertain whether the name was in use before the arrival of Europeans.[55] British military mapmakers believed Madras was originally Mundir-raj or Mundiraj, which was the name of a Telugu community, Mudiraj, who were the native inhabitants of the city.[56][57] There are also suggestions that it may have originated from the Portuguese phrase Mãe de Deus or Madre de Dios, which means "mother of God", due to Portuguese influence on the port city, specifically referring to a Church of St. Mary.[58] In August 1996, the Government of Tamil Nadu officially changed the name from Madras to Chennai. At that time many Indian cities underwent a change of name.[59][60] However, the name Madras continues in occasional use for the city,[61] as well as for places named after the city such as University of Madras, IIT Madras, Madras Institute of Technology, Madras Medical College, Madras Veterinary College, Madras Christian College. History See also: History of Chennai and Timeline of Chennai history Clive House at Fort St. George, the first English settlement in India, founded in 1639 Diogo Lopes de Sequeira, Viceroy of Portuguese India, established the first European settlement in Chennai with the construction of the port of São Tomé de Meliapor in 1522. Surrender of the City of Madras in 1746 to de La Bourdonnais, by Jacques François Joseph Swebach 18th-century print of Fort St. George, the oldest English settlement in India St. Thomas Mount, Chennai Stone age implements have been found near Pallavaram in Chennai. According to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Pallavaram was a megalithic cultural establishment, and pre-historic communities resided in the settlement.[62] The region around Chennai has served as an important administrative, military, and economic centre for many centuries. During the 1st century CE, a poet and weaver named Thiruvalluvar lived in the town of Mylapore (a neighbourhood of present-day Chennai).[63] From the 1st–12th century the region of present Tamil Nadu and parts of South India was ruled by the Cholas.[64] The Pallavas of Kanchi built the areas of Mahabalipuram and Pallavaram during the reign of Mahendravarman I. They also defeated several kingdoms including the Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas who ruled over the area before their arrival. Sculpted caves and paintings have been identified from that period.[65] Ancient coins dating to around 500 BCE have also been unearthed from the city and its surrounding areas. A portion of these findings belonged to the Vijayanagara Empire, which ruled the region during the medieval period.[66] The Portuguese first arrived in 1522 and built a port called São Tomé after the Christian apostle, St. Thomas, who is believed to have preached in the area between 52 and 70 CE. In 1612, the Dutch established themselves near Pulicat, north of Chennai.[67] On 20 August 1639 Francis Day of the East India Company along with the Nayak of Kalahasti Damarla Chennappa Nayakudu, travelled to the Chandragiri palace for an audience with the Vijayanager Emperor Peda Venkata Raya.[68] Day was seeking to obtain a grant for land on the Coromandel coast on which the company could build a factory and warehouse for their trading activities. He was successful in obtaining the lease of a strip of land about 10 km (6 mi) long and 1.6 km (1 mi) inland in return for a yearly sum of five hundred lakh pagodas.[69][70][71] On 22 August, he secured the land grant from local Nayak (Damarla Venkatadri Nayaka and his younger brother Aiyappa Nayaka of Poonamallee).[72][73] The region was then formerly a fishing village known as "Madraspatnam".[66] A year later, the Company built Fort St. George, the first major English settlement in India,[74] which became the nucleus of the growing colonial city and urban Chennai, grew around this Fort.[75] Post independence the fort housed the Tamil Nadu Assembly until the new Secretariat building was opened in 2010, but shortly afterwards it was again moved back to Fort St. George, due to a change in the Government.[76] In 1 contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 41 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Chennai responseCode 3 200
