Founded in 2013, it is currently led by party president Santiago Abascal, vice presidents Jorge Buxadé, Javier Ortega Smith, Reyes Romero, and secretary-general Ignacio Garriga.[19] Vox identifies itself as right-wing but has been described as far-right by academics and journalists.[12] The party entered the Spanish parliament for the first time after winning seats in the April 2019 general election. Later that year, it received 3.6 million votes in the November 2019 general election, winning 52 seats and becoming the third-largest party in the Congress of Deputies. Its public support reached its peak within the next few years, according to the results of subsequent regional elections and opinion polling, but in the 2023 Spanish general election showed worse results: a loss of 19 seats in parliament (albeit whilst remaining the third-largest political party in Spain with roughly 3 million votes). In the European Parliament, Vox is part of the European Conservatives and Reformists Party with Brothers of Italy and Law and Justice; it declined to join the Identity and Democracy group (which includes such far-right parties as National Rally, League, and Alternative for Germany). History[edit] Origins[edit] Javier Ortega Smith giving a speech in 2018 Vox was founded on 17 December 2013, and publicly launched at a press conference in Madrid on 16 January 2014, as a split from the People's Party (PP).[20][21][22] This schism was interpreted as an offshoot of "neoconservative"[23] or "social conservative"[24] PP party members.[a] The party platform called for the rewriting of the Spanish constitution so as to curb regional autonomy and abolish regional parliaments.[22] Several founding members of the party (for example, Alejo Vidal-Quadras, José Antonio Ortega Lara, and Santiago Abascal) had been members of the platform "reconversion.es",[b] which had issued a manifesto in 2012 calling for a recentralization of the State.[26] Vidal-Quadras was proclaimed as the first chairman in March 2014.[27][c] Their initial funding, totalling nearly 972,000 euros, came in the form of individual donations from supporters of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) and of People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK), thanks to their "personal relationship" with Vidal-Quadras, who had supported the NCRI during his stint in the EU Parliament. There is no evidence that Vox has broken Spanish or EU funding rules accepting these donations.[26][29] The 2014 European elections marked the first time the newly formed Vox fielded a candidate, with Vidal-Quadras running under its banner, though he narrowly failed to retain his seat in the European Parliament.[30] In September 2014, the party elected Santiago Abascal, one of the founders, as its President, and Iván Espinosa de los Monteros, also a founder, as General Secretary. Eleven members of the National Executive Committee were also elected. The party participated in the 2015 and the 2016 elections, but did not do well, scoring 0.23% and 0.20% of votes respectively. Amidst the Spanish constitutional crisis precipitated by the Catalan referendum, Vox opted to not participate in the Catalan regional elections of 2017.[31] After the Catalan declaration of independence, the party sued the Parliament of Catalonia and several independentist politicians.[32] Its membership grew by 20% in the span of forty days immediately following this action.[33] Entrance into institutions and opposition to COVID-19 measures[edit] On 10 September 2018, Vox enlisted Juan Antonio Morales, an independent legislator in the regional parliament of Extremadura (who had dropped out of the PP parliamentary group) as party member.[34] On 2 December 2018, they won 12 parliamentary seats in the Andalusian regional election,[35] [36] entering a regional parliament for the first time. It supported the coalition regional government by Ciudadanos and the Popular Party. With this result, Vox was also given a first seat in the Senate, which was taken by Francisco José Alcaraz.[37] The party obtained 10.26% of votes in the April 2019 general election, electing 24 Deputies and entering the Congress of Deputies for the first time.[38] Later, the party entered the European Parliament for the first time with 6.2% of the votes and three Eurodeputies, which after Brexit became four. After this election, the party joined the European Conservatives and Reformists group and the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe.[14] Vox has declined the invitation to join the Identity and Democracy group (which includes such far-right parties as National Rally, League, and Alternative for Germany).[39] In the second general election of the year in November, Vox came third and increased its number of deputies from 24 to 52.[40] It was the most-voted party in the Region of Murcia and the autonomous city of Ceuta.[41] At the beginning of 2020, during the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic, Vox called for travel restrictions between China and Spain, and later between Italy and Spain, to safeguard against the "Chinese virus".[42] At that time the epidemic was already in full swing in those countries, but it was prior to any COVID cases being officially confirmed within Spain in significant numbers. That position found no support among other parties, and it was criticized as xenophobic rhetoric.[43][44] The party claims that serious counter-COVID measures were deliberately delayed in Spain by the government, which hid the information and downplayed known risks to allow for mass public events on International Women's Day (8 March) to take place, as these events were important for the left wing agenda of the newly formed coalition government of PSOE and UP.[45] At the same time, Vox went forward with their own global party conference on 8 March in Vistalegre, where party supporters from all parts of Spain were invited. The conference resulted in numerous cases of COVID infection, including confirmed cases of COVID transmission between members of Vox leadership.[46][47] This fact was often brought up by Vox opponents to criticize Vox attitude towards COVID situation in Spain.[48] During the anti-COVID lockdown and follow-up restrictions, Vox routinely criticized government measures as inefficient, partisan, and partially unconstitutional.[49] In April 2020 the party appealed to the Constitutional Court of Spain against the first State of Alarm (15 March – 21 June) declared by the government.[50] In October 2020, Vox's parliamentary group at the Congress of Deputies tabled a motion of no confidence against the current Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, bringing Santiago Abascal as alternative candidate.[51] The motion failed to gain any support among the other parliamentary groups, gathering 52 'yes' votes (those of Vox legislators) and 298 'no' votes (the rest of the chamber).[52] In November 2020 Vox appealed to the Constitutional Court of Spain against the second State of Alarm (October 25, 2020 – May 9, 2021) declared by the government.[53] In the face of the 2020 United States presidential election, Vox was fully supportive of President Donald Trump's candidacy,[54] even tweeting from its official account that Joe Biden was the preferred candidate of "El País, Podemos, Otegi, Maduro, China, Iran and pedophiles", which according to the international news agency EFE was echoing QAnon conspiracy theories.[55] Vox took part in the 2021 CPAC conference and refused to acknowledge Biden's victory.[56] Santiago Abascal during a rally in 2021 At the beginning of 2021, Vox's abstention was instrumental in securing European COVID-recovery funds on Socialist terms.[57] Many Vox supporters considered this as the "largest error in Vox's history".[58] During 2020 and 2021 electoral campaigns for regional elections in the Basque Country,[59] Catalonia,[60] and the Community of Madrid[61] multiple legal electoral events of Vox were physically attacked by radical political opponents on the premises of "Vox's legitimate electoral events in some regions being provocative acts". The view of the events as provocations was endorsed by high ranking UP members, including their speaker Pablo Echenique, and their leader, the Second Deputy Prime Minister of Spain at the time, Pablo Iglesias.[62] On 14 July 2021, in response to the Vox's appeal the previous year, the Constitutional Court of Spain declared by a narrow majority (6 votes in support vs. 5 votes against) that the first anti-COVID State of Alarm was unconstitutional in the part of suppressing the freedom of movement established by the Article 19 of the Constitution.[63] In October 2021 the Constitutional Court of Spain supported two other appeals by Vox, and declared unconstitutional the closing down of Spanish Parliament and Senate in the beginning of pandemic, and the second State of  contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 55 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Vox_(political_party) responseCode 3 200
