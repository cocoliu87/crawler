They got married with a grand ceremony held at Chittagong and a similar kind of reception at Dhaka on 27th of the same month. Former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia was also present at the event.[15] When asked about his relationship prior to his marriage, the dashing opener said "I had only Tk 5,000 in my account when she [Ayesha] went for higher education in Malaysia and it was very tough to maintain regular communication with her. But luckily I got a national call-up and I bought a laptop and an air ticket with the match fees from my first international match. There were lot of ups and downs in our relationship but we had the patience to make today's occasion possible. "He also added, "I was not a starter when we fell in love eight years back and she has little interest in cricket. So one thing is very clear; she loves Tamim the person, not Tamim Iqbal the cricketer."[16]He had his first son named Arham Iqbal Khan on 28 February 2016 and his first daughter named Alishba Iqbal Khan on 19 November 2019.[17] Domestic and T20 franchise career[edit] This article may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia's quality standards.
