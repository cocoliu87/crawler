Suomen Yleisradio / A.B. Finlands Rundradio[3] Official website yle.fi Yleisradio Oy (lit. 'Public Radio, Ltd.'; Swedish: Rundradion Ab), abbreviated as Yle ( Finnish pronunciation: [ˈyle]) and translated to English as the Finnish Broadcasting Company, is Finland's national public broadcasting company, founded in 1926. It is a joint-stock company which is 99.98% owned by the Finnish state, and employs around 3,200 people in Finland. Yle shares many of its organizational characteristics with its British counterpart, the BBC, on which it was largely modeled. Yle also owns Pikku Kakkonen, Which is a popular Children's TV show. Pikku Kakkonen is shown on TV, on the channel Yle 2. The literal translation of "Pikku Kakkonen" is "tiny two". Yle was long funded by revenues obtained from a broadcast receiving license fee payable by the owners of radio sets (1927–1976) and television sets (1958–2012), as well as receiving a portion of the broadcasting license fees payable by private television broadcasters. Since 2013, the license fee has been replaced by a public broadcasting tax (known as the Yle tax), collected annually from private individuals and corporations together with their other taxes. By far the largest part of the Yle tax is collected from individual taxpayers, with payments assessed on a sliding scale. Minors and those with an annual income less than €7,813 are exempt. At the lower limit the tax payable by individuals is €50 per annum and the maximum (payable by an individual with a yearly income of €20,588 or more) is €140.[4] The rationale for the abolition of the television license fee was the development of other means of delivering Yle's services, such as the Internet, and the consequent impracticality of continuing to tie the fee to the ownership of a specific device. Yle receives no advertising revenue, as all channels are advertisement-free. Yle has a status that could be described as that of a non-departmental public body. It is governed by a parliamentary governing council. Yle's turnover in 2010 was €398.4 million. In 2022, Yle's annual budget was about €560 million.[5] Yle operates three national television channels, 13 radio channels and services, and 25 regional radio stations. As Finland is constitutionally bilingual—around 5.5% of the population speaks Swedish as their mother tongue—Yle provides radio and TV programming in Swedish through its Swedish-language department, Svenska Yle. As is customary in Finnish television and cinemas, foreign films and TV programs, as well as segments of local programs that feature foreign language dialogues (e.g. news interviews), are generally subtitled on Yle's channels. Dubbing is used in cartoons intended for young children who have not yet learned to read; off-screen narration in documentaries is also frequently dubbed.[citation needed] In the field of international broadcasting, one of Yle's best-known services was Nuntii Latini, the news in Latin, which was broadcast worldwide and made available on the Internet. Yle was one of 23 founding broadcasting organizations of the European Broadcasting Union in 1950. It hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 in Helsinki. History[edit] This section needs expansion.

(August 2017) Equipment made in Yleisradio's workshop at the end of the 1930s intended for broadcasting the 1940 Summer Olympics Yle's headquarters from 1993 to 2016, known as Iso Paja ("the big workshop"), in Pasila, Helsinki. Now occupied by the VR Group. Suomen Yleisradio (Finland's General Radio) was founded in Helsinki on 29 May 1926. The first radio program was transmitted on 9 September that year, the date generally considered the birthday of regular broadcasting activities in Finland. Not until 1928 did Yle's broadcasts become available throughout the country. By the beginning of the 1930s, 100,000 households could listen to Yle programs. In 1957, Yle made its first television broadcast tests, and regular TV programming started the next year under the name Suomen Televisio (Finland's Television), which was later renamed Yle TV1. Television's popularity in the country grew rapidly. In 1964, Yle obtained TES-TV and Tamvisio, which were merged to Yle TV2. In 1969, the Finnish Broadcasting Company began broadcasting television programs in color, but due to the high cost of technology, color became standard only in the late 1970s. On 1 May 1977, Tv-uutiset (~ TV-news) and TV-nytt switched to color. In the 2000s, Yle founded a number of new radio and television channels. In 2007, there was a digital television switchover. A completely new digital channel, Yle Teema (~ Yle Theme) was introduced, and the Swedish-language FST (Finlands Svenska Television, ~ Finland's Swedish Television) was moved from the reserved analogue channel time to its own digital channel YLE FST5, which was later renamed Yle Fem. In addition to these four channels (TV1, TV2, Teema, and Fem), a fifth channel, YLE24, was launched in 2001 for 24-hour news programming. This channel was replaced by YLE Extra, a channel attempting to cater to the youth, which was in turn decommissioned in 2007.[6] Until 4 August 2008, the fifth channel was used to broadcast Yle TV1 with Finnish subtitles broadcast on programs in foreign languages (without having to enable the TV's or digital set-top box's subtitle function).
