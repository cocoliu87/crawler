Background[edit] It was formed for the first time in 2006 in order to unite against the Israel Defense Forces during clashes and wars and included Hamas and the Islamic Jihad Movement, but it fell into obscurity. It was then developed, expanded, and was formed under its current name on July 23, 2018, among 12 military wings after violations by Israel in Jerusalem and the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the most prominent of which was the installation of electronic gates.[4] It currently consists of 12 different armed groups, and has coordinated a large number of attacks on Israel including the October 7 attacks,[citation needed] and has also coordinated defence and retaliations against Israeli aggression.[5][6][7] Ayman Nofal in May 2023 explained the goals and organization of the room, which he said was to create an inter-organizational alliance to coordinate operations, and increase the potential of the "Palestinian Resistance", and for it to "become a comprehensive framework for all the organizations, networks and fighters, without exception".[8] He also gave a list of the 9 factions out of 12 which he said were "fully unified under the room".[5] Members[edit] Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades: Hamas[5][9][10][11] Al-Quds Brigades: Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)[5][9][10][11] Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades: Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)[5][9][11] National Resistance Brigades: Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP)[5][9][11] Al-Nasser Salah al-Deen Brigades: Popular Resistance Committees (PRC)[5][9][11] Mujahideen Brigades: (Palestinian Mujahideen Movement)[5][9][11] Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades (ex-Fatah, no longer aligned with it)[5][9][11] Jihad Jibril Brigades: (Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command (PFLP-GC)[5][9] Al-Ansar Brigades (Palestinian Freedom Movement)[5][9][11] Not mentioned by Nofal:[5] Ayman Jawda Squads (ex-Fatah)[5][9] Abd al Qadr al-Husseini Brigades (ex-Fatah)[5][9] Al-Assefa Army (ex-Fatah)[5][9] See also[edit] Rejectionist Front References[edit] ^ "غرفة العمليات المشتركة..
