Reference levels are set up based on statistics obtained from the multi-decadal observations (typically 30 years).[3] Free-flowing rivers[edit] Free-flowing rivers use the low navigable water level (also lowest navigable water level, LNWL) as a low reference water level.[3] When the river is at or above LNWL, the ships of the target draft can use its fairway.[4] LNWL is usually defined as the water level that the river surface stays mostly above at the times when the river is navigable (e. g., during the ice-free season in Europe),[3] so that the river level on average stays below the LNWL only for a fixed small portion of a year. For example, in Europe the limit of time below LNWL is 20 ice-free days per year (e. g., on Rhine) or, alternatively, corresponds to 5–6% of the ice-free period on European rivers (6% on Danube[3]).[5] The highest navigable water level (HNWL) is defined as a water level that is exceeded for only a few days a year (usually 1%). Regulated rivers, canals[edit] The low reference level is usually not defined for regulated rivers and canals, as in these cases the depth of the navigation channel is guaranteed by design (sufficient margins are covering the variations of the flow).[1] The high reference water level (MHW) is sometimes set to accommodate the short-term variations (for example, tidal effects, usually at the levels observed 1% of the time) and the effect of water level changes due to the operation of locks and weirs.[1] Equivalent water level[edit] In Germany, an equivalent water level (German: Gleichwertiger Wasserstand, GlW) is the value of a stream gauge that corresponds to the nominal fairway depth (ideal minimum channel depth, TuGlW).[6] See also[edit] Chart datum Vertical datum References[edit] ^ a b c d Muilerman et al. 2018, p. 63. ^ Wang, Lu; Xie, Ping; Xu, Chong-Yu; Sang, Yan-Fang; Chen, Jie; Yu, Tao (2 August 2021).
