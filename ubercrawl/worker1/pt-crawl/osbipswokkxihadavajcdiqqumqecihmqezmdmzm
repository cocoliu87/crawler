ISO basic Latin alphabet AaBbCcDdEeFfGgHhIiJjKkLlMmNnOoPpQqRrSsTtUuVvWwXxYyZz v t e P, or p, is the sixteenth letter of the Latin alphabet, used in the modern English alphabet, the alphabets of other western European languages and others worldwide. Its name in English is pee (pronounced /ÀàpiÀê/), plural pees.[1] History The Semitic P√™ (mouth), as well as the Greek Œ† or œÄ (Pi), and the Etruscan and Latin letters that developed from the former alphabet, all symbolized /p/, a voiceless bilabial plosive. Egyptian Proto-Sinaitic Proto-Canaanite p øit Phoenician pe Archaic Greek Pi Greek Pi Etruscan P Latin P Use in writing systems Late Renaissance or early Baroque design of a P, from 1627 In English orthography and most other European languages, ‚ü®p‚ü© represents the sound /p/. A common digraph in English is ‚ü®ph‚ü©, which represents the sound /f/, and can be used to transliterate ‚ü®œÜ‚ü© phi in loanwords from Greek. In German, the digraph ‚ü®pf‚ü© is common, representing a labial affricate /pf/. Most English words beginning with ‚ü®p‚ü© are of foreign origin, primarily French, Latin and Greek; these languages preserve Proto-Indo-European initial *p. Native English cognates of such words often start with ‚ü®f‚ü©, since English is a Germanic language and thus has undergone Grimm's law; a native English word with initial /p/ would reflect Proto-Indo-European initial *b, which is so rare that its existence as a phoneme is disputed. However, native English words with non-initial ‚ü®p‚ü© are quite common; such words can come from either Kluge's law or the consonant cluster /sp/ (PIE *p has been preserved after s). In the International Phonetic Alphabet, /p/ is used to represent the voiceless bilabial plosive. P is the eighth least frequently used letter in the English language. Music A bold italic letter p is used in musical notation as a dynamic indicator for "quiet". It stands for the Italian word piano.[2][3] Related characters Ancestors, descendants and siblings The Latin letter P represents the same sound as the Greek letter Pi, but it looks like the Greek letter Rho. ê§ê : Semitic letter Pe, from which the following symbols originally derive Œ† œÄ : Greek letter Pi êåê : Old Italic and Old Latin P, which derives from Greek Pi, and is the ancestor of modern Latin P.
