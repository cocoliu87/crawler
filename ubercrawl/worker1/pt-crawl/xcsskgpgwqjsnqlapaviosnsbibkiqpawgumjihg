Los Angeles Times CNN I know this entry is a bit early, but i think that the Boycott should make it to the front page since "some are saying Monday could be the largest day of protest since the Vietnam War". dposse 22:45, 28 April 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] I agree. If this protest is large enough, it will definitely be worthy for the "In the news" section. BTW, if anyone's wondering, an article on this protest has been started: Great American Boycott. --G VOLTT 00:32, 29 April 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] There's also the Spanish version of the Star-spangled Banner that was talked about on the New York Times today (Nuestro Himno). Maybe combine the two somehow. Mithridates 15:24, 29 April 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] This definitely should be on the Main Page on Monday (although I don't like the current sentence). joturner 16:31, 29 April 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Does anyone think this is significant enough: the Global Night Commute? It is happening tonight, and it has over 50,000 people signed up so far. The people are going to be sleeping in city parks to protest the situation in Uganda with the Lord's Resistence Army. --Basar 18:20, 29 April 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] seconded!--gozar 19:32, 29 April 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] What about the 2006 NFL Draft starting?-Bio2590 23:00, 29 April 2006 (UTC) April 28, 2006 The Bush administration took initial steps to use the States Secrets Privilege to block a lawsuit against AT&T and the NSA brought by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

This is a significant business story, with South Korea cracking down on corruption. Both Chung Mong Koo and Hyundai Motor Company articles are updated. --Aude (talk | contribs) 18:58, 28 April 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Comment: Maybe an article on the current anti-corruption campaign in South Korea is in order.

The Conservative government of Canada announced on Monday, April 24 that it will no longer lower the flag on top of the Peace Tower at Parliament Hill whenever a Canadian soldier has been killed in action, reversing a practice set down by the previous government in 2002. This announcement came after the news of four Canadian soldiers killed by an improvised roadside bomb in Afghanistan. It has been updated on WikiNews. (CBC) FellowWikipedian talk 19:20, 28 April 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Then it should only be on Wikinews and Current Events until we have an updated Wikipedia article, which I don't really see happening with this story. --Golbez 19:48, 28 April 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] I guess I can't add an article on Wikipedia on this. It should stay on WikiNews.

(BBC) Govus 17:27, 27 April 2006 (UTC) (seems like a major event to me...)Reply[reply] Object - construction beginning is surely not notable enough. Maybe when it is finished/opened it will be, though. Batmanand | Talk 21:26, 27 April 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] This is pretty important to anyone. This story should be posted. FellowWikipedian talk Post. This event is very significant, as it is the beginning of the new plan for Ground Zero, and it ends a long debate, as mentioned in above blurb. Clarkefreak ∞ 22:09, 27 April 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] It will be finished in 2011.
