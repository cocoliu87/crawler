Any other opinions? --Tone 15:47, 30 December 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Nope, we don't post election results from Scotland, Hong Kong, Puerto Rico, etc. either. It should be something historic like Sark elections ending feudal order in Europe or Greenland's referendum for autonomy from Denmark. Try DYK. --GPPande 15:52, 30 December 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] We had Taiwan elections, but those are from a more autonomous state considered by many to be an independent nation. However, Bouganville is much, much smaller, and as gppande said, it's not historic like other sub-entities. Oppose.
