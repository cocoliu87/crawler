Background[edit] The building was designed by Kisho Kurokawa and completed in 1994 as Lane Crawford Place (Chinese: 达卡佛坊).[1] It is now owned by Wharf Estates Singapore, formerly "Wheelock Properties (Singapore)",[2] a division of Hong Kong's Wheelock and Co. The mall has an underpass to Shaw House and ION Orchard.[3] It was the site of Borders' flagship Singapore store until its closure in 2011.[4] Following which, Marks & Spencer became Wheelock Place's main tenant.[5] A new book shop, Zall Bookstore, opened in 2021.[6] The mall houses multiple homegrown retail, food, and lifestyle brands. Among these are Browhaus, Cedele, and Privè.
