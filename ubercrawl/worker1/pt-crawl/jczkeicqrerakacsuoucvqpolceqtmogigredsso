The region's largest city and administrative capital is Beersheba (pop. 211,251), in the north. At its southern end is the Gulf of Aqaba and the resort city and port of Eilat. It contains several development towns, including Dimona, Arad, and Mitzpe Ramon, as well as a number of small Bedouin towns, including Rahat, Tel Sheva, and Lakiya. There are also several kibbutzim, including Revivim and Sde Boker; the latter became the home of Israel's first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, after his retirement from politics. Although historically part of a separate region (known during the Roman period as Arabia Petraea), the Negev was added to the proposed area of Mandatory Palestine, of which large parts later became Israel, on 10 July 1922, having been conceded by British representative St John Philby "in Trans-Jordan's name".[a] Despite this, the region remained exclusively Arab until 1946; in response to the British Morrison–Grady Plan which would have allotted the area to an Arab state, the Jewish Agency enacted the 11 points in the Negev plan to begin Jewish settlement in the area.[2][3] A year later, the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine allotted a larger part of the area to the Jewish State which became Israel. The desert is home to the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, whose faculties include the Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research and the Albert Katz International School for Desert Studies, both located on the Midreshet Ben-Gurion campus adjacent to Sde Boker. In October 2012, global travel guide publisher Lonely Planet rated the Negev second on a list of the world's top ten regional travel destinations for 2013, noting its current transformation through development.[4][5] The Negev (red), Israel's parts of the Judaean Mountains (salmon) and Judaean Desert (pink) on a map of Israel Etymology and other names The origin of the word Negev is from the Hebrew root denoting 'dry'; in the Hebrew Bible, the word Negev is also used for the direction 'south'. Some English-language translations use the spelling Negeb. The Negev mentioned in the Bible consisted only of the northernmost part of the modern Israeli Negev, with the semiarid Arad-Beersheba Valley defined as "the eastern (biblical) Negev".[6] In Arabic, the Negev is known as an-Naqab or an-Naqb ('the [mountain] pass'),[7][8] though it was not thought of as a distinct region until the demarcation of the Egypt-Ottoman frontier in the 1890s and has no single Arabic name.[9] During the British Mandate, it was called "Beersheba sub-district".[9] Geography Nahal Paran The Negev contains the oldest discovered surface on Earth, with an approximate age of 1.8 million years.[10][11] During the Pleistocene, the Negev fluctuated between intervals of relative humidity and intervals of aridity similar to or even more severe than the present day; from around 80,000 to 13,000 years BP, during a time interval roughly corresponding to the Last Glacial Period, the Negev was significantly more humid than today.[12] It covers more than half of Israel, over some 13,000 km2 (5,000 sq mi), or at least 55% of the country's land area. It forms an inverted triangle shape whose western side is contiguous with the desert of the Sinai Peninsula, and whose eastern border is the Arabah valley. The Negev has a number of interesting cultural and geological features. Among the latter are three enormous, craterlike makhteshim (box canyons), which are unique to the region: Makhtesh Ramon, HaMakhtesh HaGadol, and HaMakhtesh HaKatan. The Negev is a rocky desert. It is a melange of brown, rocky, dusty mountains interrupted by wadis (dry riverbeds that bloom briefly after rain) and deep craters. It can be split into five different ecological regions: northern, western and central Negev, the high plateau and the Arabah Valley. The northern Negev, or Mediterranean zone, receives 300 mm (12 in) of rain annually and has fairly fertile soils. The western Negev receives 250 mm (9.8 in) of rain per year, with light and partially sandy soils. Sand dunes can reach heights of up to 30 metres (98 ft) here. Home to the city of Beersheba, the central Negev has an annual precipitation of 200 mm (7.9 in) and is characterized by impervious soil, known as loess, allowing minimum penetration of water with greater soil erosion and water runoff. The high plateau area of Negev Mountains/Ramat HaNegev (Hebrew: רמת הנגב, The Negev Heights) stands between 370 metres (1,210 ft) and 520 metres (1,710 ft) above sea level with extreme temperatures in summer and winter. The area gets 100 mm (3.9 in) of rain per year, with inferior and partially salty soils. The Arabah Valley along the Jordanian border stretches 180 km (110 mi) from Eilat in the south to the tip of the Dead Sea in the north. The Arabah Valley is very arid with barely 50 mm (2.0 in) of rain annually. It has inferior soils, in which little can grow without irrigation and special soil additives. Flora and fauna Flowers bloom in the Negev Mountains in early spring, after winter rains Vegetation in the Negev is sparse, but certain trees and plants thrive there, among them Acacia, Pistacia, Retama, Urginea maritima and Thymelaea.[13] Hyphaene thebaica or doum palm can be found in the Southern Negev. The Evrona Nature Reserve is the most northerly point in the world where this palm can be found. A small population of Arabian leopards, an endangered animal in the Arabian peninsula, survives in the southern Negev.[14] Other carnivora found in the Negev are the caracal, the striped hyena, the Arabian wolf, the golden jackal and the marbled polecat.[15] The Arabah mountain gazelle survives with a few individuals in the Negev. The dorcas gazelle is more numerous, with some 1,000–1,500 individuals in the Negev.[15] Some 350 to 500 Nubian ibex live in the Negev Highlands and in the Eilat Mountains.[16] The Negev shrew is a species of mammal of the family Soricidae that is found only in Israel.[17] A population of the critically endangered Kleinmann's tortoise (also known as the Negev tortoise) survives in the sands of the western and central Negev Desert.[18] Animals that were reintroduced after their extinction in the wild or localized extinction respectively are the Arabian oryx and the Persian fallow deer. Also introduced was the Asiatic wild ass, which in the Negev counts about 250 animals.[19] Like many areas in Israel and the rest of the Middle East, the Negev used to host in the distant past the Asiatic lion and the Asiatic cheetah, right until their complete extinction at the hands of humans in later centuries. Climate The Negev region is arid (Eilat receives on average only 24 mm (0.94 in) of rainfall a year), receiving very little rain due to its location to the east of the Sahara (as opposed to the Mediterranean, which lies to the west of Israel), and extreme temperatures due to its location 31 degrees north. However the northernmost areas of the Negev, including Beersheba, are semi-arid. The usual rainfall total from June through October is zero. Snow and frost are rare in the northern Negev, and snow and frost are unknown in the vicinity of Eilat in the southernmost Negev.[20] Climate data for Beersheba Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 28.4 (83.1) 31 (88) 35.4 (95.7) 40.9 (105.6) 42.2 (108.0) 46 (115) 41.5 (106.7) 40.5 (104.9) 41.2 (106.2) 39.6 (103.3) 34 (93) 31.4 (88.5) 46 (115) Average high °C (°F) 16.7 (62.1) 17.5 (63.5) 20.1 (68.2) 25.8 (78.4) 29 (84) 31.3 (88.3) 32.7 (90.9) 32.8 (91.0) 31.3 (88.3) 28.5 (83.3) 23.5 (74.3) 18.8 (65.8) 25.7 (78.3) Average low °C (°F) 7.5 (45.5) 7.6 (45.7) 9.3 (48.7) 12.7 (54.9) 15.4 (59.7) 18.4 (65.1) 20.5 (68.9) 20.9 (69.6) 19.5 (67.1) 16.7 (62.1) 12.6 (54.7) 8.9 (48.0) 14.2 (57.6) Record low °C (°F) −5 (23) −0.5 (31.1) 2.4 (36.3) 4 (39) 8 (46) 13.6 (56.5) 15.8 (60.4) 15.6 (60.1) 13 (55) 10.2 (50.4) 3.4 (38.1) 3 (37) −5 (23) Average precipitation mm (inches) 49.6 (1.95) 40.4 (1.59) 30.7 (1.21) 12.9 (0.51) 2.7 (0.11) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0.4 (0.02) 5.8 (0.23) 19.7 (0.78) 41.9 (1.65) 204.1 (8.04) Average precipitation days 9.2 8 6.4 2.6 0.8 0 0 0 0.1 1.8 4.6 7.5 41 Source: Israel Meteorological Service[21][22] Climate data for Eilat Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 32.2 (90.0) 35.8 (96.4) 38.7 (101.7) 43.4 (110.1) 45.2 (113.4) 47.4 (117.3) 48.3 (118.9) 48.0 (118.4) 45.0 (113.0) 44.3 (111.7) 38.1 (100.6) 33.6 (92.5) 48.3 (118.9) Average high °C (°F) 21.3 (70.3) 23.0 (73.4) 26.1 (79.0) 31.0 (87.8) 35.7 (96.3) 38.9 (102.0) 40.4 (104.7) 40.0 (104.0) 37.3 (99.1) 33.1 (91.6) 27.7 (81.9) 23.0 (73.4) 31.5 (88.6) Average low °C (°F) 10.4 (50.7) 11.8 (53.2) 14.6 (58.3) 18.4 (65.1) 22.5 (72.5) 25.2 (77.4) 27.3 (81.1) 27.4 (81.3) 25.2 (77.4) 21.8 (71.2) 16.3 (61.3) 11.9 (53.4) 19.4 (66.9) Record low °C (°F) 1.2 (34.2) 0.9 (33.6) 3.0 (37.4) 8.4 (47.1) 12.1 (53.8) 18.5 (65.3) 20.0 (68.0) 19.4 (66.9) 18.6 (65.5) 9.2 (48.6) 5.3 (41.5) 2.5 (36.5) 0.9 (33.6) Average rainfall mm (inches) 4 (0.2) 3 (0.1) 3 (0.1) 2 (0.1) 1 (0.0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 4 (0.2) 2 (0.1) 5 (0.2) 24 (1) Average rainy days (≥ 0.1 mm) 2.1 1.8 1.6 0.9 0.7 0 0 0 0 0.7 0.8 1.9 10.5 Source: Israel Meteorological Service[23][24][25][26] History Of the three Acacia species growing in high plateau of the Negev, Acacia pachyceras is the most cold- contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 39 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Negev responseCode 3 200
