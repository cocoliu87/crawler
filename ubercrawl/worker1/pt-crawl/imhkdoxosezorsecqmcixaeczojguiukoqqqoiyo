Bush in July 2006 Regional Governor of Darfur Incumbent Assumed office 10 August 2021 (2021-08-10) President Abdel Fattah al-Burhan Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok Preceded by office created Chairperson of the Transitional Darfur Regional Authority In office 23 April 2007 – 6 December 2010 Preceded by office created Succeeded by Shartai Jaafar Abdel Hakam Personal details Born (1968-12-12) December 12, 1968 (age 54) Furawiyya, North Darfur, Sudan[1] Political party Sudan Liberation Movement Suliman Arcua Minnawi (Arabic: سليمان أركو مناوي; born 12 December 1968), also known as "Minni Minnawi" (مني مناوي), is a Sudanese politician who was the leader of the largest faction of the Sudanese Liberation Army. A former educator, Minnawi was the Secretary of Sudan Liberation Army leader, Abdul Wahid Nur, before the organisation split in 2004. Minnawi signed a treaty, known as the Darfur Peace Agreement, with the Khartoum government in May 2006. Nevertheless, in July 2006, fighting broke out around the North Darfur town of Korma, resulting in the deaths of at least 80 people.[2] In the same year, Minnawi was appointed the top Sudanese official in the Darfur region, as chairman of the Transitional Darfur Regional Authority, and was technically the fourth ranking member of the Presidency, as Senior Assistant to the President of the Republic. On September 14, 2006, in defiance of the central government's opposition, Minnawi supported the new UN peacekeeping force detailed in UNSC Resolution 1706, which was designed to protect the Sudanese people.[3] Minnawi opposed the Sudan government's genocidal agenda, which was exercised by Omar al-Bashir against the Zaghawa, and civilians, for which crimes Bashir was later indicted by the International Criminal Court (ICC).[4] In December 2010, after repeated complaints of non-compliance by the National Congress Party with the peace accords, the Sudan Liberation Movement withdrew from the Darfur Peace Agreement.[5] Minnawi resigned as Senior Assistant to the President of Sudan and as Chairperson of the Transitional Darfur Regional Authority,[6] to merge his faction, SLM/MM, with the other resistance defense forces in Darfur, including SLM/AW, Abdul Wahid, in resisting attacks by the Sudanese Armed Forces, and its militia, on citizens in rebel-held areas. In 2011, SLM/MM joined the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF) opposed to the Khartoum Government.[7] In May 2021, Minni Minnawi was appointed governor of the Darfur Regional Government. He was inaugurated on 10 August.[8] References[edit] ^ Alsharq AL-Aawsat Page 8 ، Tuesday 6/4/2010 No 11452 ^ "BBC NEWS - Africa - Bloody battle in northern Darfur". 10 July 2006.
