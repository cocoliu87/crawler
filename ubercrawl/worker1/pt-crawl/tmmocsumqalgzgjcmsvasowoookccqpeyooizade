It grew out of, and is primarily composed of, the Janjaweed militias which fought on behalf of the Sudanese government during the War in Darfur, and was responsible for atrocities against civilians.[11][12] Its actions in Darfur qualify as crimes against humanity according to Human Rights Watch.[8] RSF is administered by the National Intelligence and Security Service, while during military operations is commanded by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF).[13] As of June 2019[update], the commander is General Hemedti ("Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo").[14] During the Sudanese political crisis of 2019, the military junta that took control of the country employed RSF to violently crack down on pro-democracy demonstrators.[14] Along with other security forces, RSF carried out the Khartoum massacre on 3 June 2019.[15][16][17] On 15 April 2023, fighting broke out between RSF and the SAF after RSF mobilized its forces in cities across Sudan, including in Darfur.[18] SAF has designated RSF a rebel group. RSF forces claim to have occupied Khartoum International Airport and other areas in Khartoum.[19] Origin[edit] RSF has its roots in the Janjaweed militias used by the Sudanese Government in its attempts to fight the anti-government insurgency during the War in Darfur. RSF was officially formed in 2013, following a restructuring and reactivation of Janjaweed militias in order to combat rebel groups in Darfur region, South Kordofan, and the Blue Nile states, following joint attacks by Sudanese Revolutionary Front rebels in North and South Kordofan in April 2013.[2] Leadership and numbers[edit] RSF is headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo ("Hemetti"), who has been its leader since it was created in 2013 or 2014.[20][14] As of September 2019[update], Hemetti's brother Abdul Rahim Hamdan Dagalo is deputy head of RSF.[2] RSF was estimated by Human Rights Watch as having about 5,000–6,000 soldiers in February 2014 in Darfur.[8] In 2016–2017, RSF had 40,000 members participating in the Yemeni Civil War. In late October 2019, 10,000 had returned to Sudan.[10] In July 2019, about 1,000 RSF soldiers were present in Libya, supporting the Libyan National Army commanded by Khalifa Haftar.[9] According to Reuters, as of 2023, the force numbers 100,000 people.[1] Role[edit] Migration control[edit] In addition to its role in Darfur, RSF is deployed to patrol the border with Libya and round up Eritrean and Ethiopian refugees in response to the Khartoum process, which is an initiative between European and African states, including Sudan, to stem the flow of migrants to Europe.[21] Business interests[edit] In November 2017, Hemetti used RSF to take over control of gold mines in the Darfur region, which led to him becoming one of the richest people in Sudan by 2019.[22] Hemetti's brother Abdul Rahim, deputy head of RSF, heads the Al Junaid (or Al Gunade) corporation involved in gold mining and trading in Sudan.[23] In December 2019, a Global Witness investigation into RSF and Al Junaid argued that RSF and Al Junaid are closely linked in terms of financial transactions. Global Witness stated that "the RSF and [Al Junaid had] captured a swathe of the [Sudanese] gold industry and [were] likely using it to fund their operations." The General Manager of Al Junaid stated to Thomson Reuters that there were no close links between the two.[23] RSF has two front companies called GSK, a Sudanese technology company, and Tradive General Trading LLC, a United Arab Emirates-based company, both controlled by Hemetti's brother Algoney Hamdan Dagalo.[23] In April 2023, Al Jazeera reported that RSF had sought out Western public relations firms to burnish its image, including by editing Wikipedia pages.[24] War in Darfur[edit] See also: International Criminal Court investigation in Darfur During the War in Darfur, in 2014 and 2015, RSF "repeatedly attacked villages, burned and looted homes, beating, raping and executing villagers," aided by air and ground support from the Sudanese Armed Forces.[8] RSF executions and rapes typically took place in villages after rebels had left. The attacks were systematic enough to qualify as crimes against humanity according to Human Rights Watch.[8] Relationship with the United Arab Emirates[edit] The gold mined in Sudan was sent to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, where RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo kept most of his money, which he used to fund his paramilitaries.[25][26][27] In 2019, Global Witness reported that UAE was a key supplier of military equipment to RSF.[23] Dagalo was funded by the United Arab Emirates and met with the leader of UAE, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, in February 2022. According to Sudanese diplomats, his closest ally in the Emirates is the country's vice president, Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan.[25][28] The UAE, which was supporting the RSF, conducted a covert operation under the pretence of aiding refugees. The operation involved supplying potent weapons and drones to the RSF, providing medical treatment to wounded fighters, and airlifting severe cases to one of its military hospitals. The operation was headquartered at an airfield and a hospital in Amdjarass in Chad.[29] Relationship with the Wagner Group[edit] According to a report by Al Araby TV, there are allegations of a connection between the Wagner Group, a Russian paramilitary organization, and Hemetti. Leaked documents and sources reportedly indicate that the Wagner Group has provided training and equipment, including armored vehicles and helicopter gunships, to Hemetti's forces. The Russian company is alleged to have provided security services during Hemetti's visit to Russia in 2018.[30] Hemetti's association with the Wagner Group may raise questions about his own involvement in human rights violations, particularly given his role in the crackdown on protesters during Sudan's 2019 revolution and as the founder of the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary group accused of committing human rights abuses in Darfur and elsewhere in Sudan.[30] The Sudanese government has denied any connection to the Wagner Group, and the reports suggest that Hemetti may be using his position in the Sovereign Council to establish ties with the Russian company.[31] Both Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo and Sudan's military leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan had ties to the Putin regime in Russia. According to Business Insider, "The two generals helped Russian President Vladimir Putin exploit Sudan's gold resources to help buttress Russian finances against Western sanctions and fund his war in Ukraine."[32] International civil wars[edit] Libyan Civil War[edit] During the 2019 Western Libya offensive phase of the Second Libyan Civil War, in July 2019, about 1,000 RSF soldiers were present in Libya, supporting the Libyan National Army (LNA) commanded by Khalifa Haftar and based in Tobruk, which was fighting against the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) based in Tripoli.[9] Yemeni Civil War[edit] RSF has participated in the Yemeni Civil War (2015–present), supporting the pro-Hadi forces. RSF and other Sudanese security forces, participating in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen alongside Saudi and Emirati forces,[33] have killed civilians and destroyed infrastructure, for which they are suspected of war crimes by Human Rights Watch.[34][35][36][37] Saudi Arabia organised and financed this involvement, which brought financial resources to the RSF.[38] In 2016–2017, RSF had 40,000 members participating in the Yemeni Civil War. In October 2019, 10,000 had returned to Sudan.[10] 2023 War in Sudan[edit] Main article: War in Sudan (2023) On 15 April 2023, fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces and RSF broke out after RSF mobilised in cities across Sudan. Fighting was reported at the presidential palace and army headquarters.[39][40] The conflict resulted in RSF being designated as a rebel group by the Sudanese Armed Forces. On the day of the clashes which included the Battle of Khartoum, both sides claimed control over Khartoum and Merowe airports, and other sites.[41] On 17 April 2023, the U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken and RSF leader gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, had talks, after which gen Dagalo agreed to a 24-hour armistice from 18 April 2023 “to ensure the safe passage of civilians and the evacuation of the wounded,”.[42] Another 72-hour nationwide cease-fire had been announced from midnight, 24 April 2023. The United States and Saudi Arabia had mediated the truce on humanitarian grounds. The fight had caused death of more than 500 people by 25 April 2023 and thousands were injured.[43] The foreign nations interfered in the conflict by providing military support to the warring parties. Rapid Support Forces supported by the Libyan militia leader Khalifa Haftar and the United Arab Emirates. The footage of thermobaric shells captured by the Sudanese military suggest that the thermobaric weapon was supplied by UAE to RSF.
