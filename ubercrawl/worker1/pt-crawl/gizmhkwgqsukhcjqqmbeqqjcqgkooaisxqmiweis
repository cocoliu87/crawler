(See Help:Wikitext for wiki equivalents to HTML tags not otherwise discussed below.) And HTML is useful outside of articles, for example for formatting within templates. For help with Cascading Style Sheet use within Wikipedia see Help:Cascading Style Sheets. Some tags look like HTML, but are actually MediaWiki parser and extension tags, and so are really wiki markup. HTML in pages can be checked for HTML5 compliance by using validation. Some elements and attributes are supported by MediaWiki and browsers, but have been deprecated by HTML5, and therefore should no longer be used. Tutorials This help page gives only an overview of allowed markup. For further assistance and detailed specifications: HTML5 Introduction at developer.mozilla.org HTML5 Introduction at w3schools.com Attributes HTML attributes provide additional information about an element and are always specified in the start tag. They are formatted as a name/value pair like name="value". Global attributes apply to all tags. Attributes not listed here are not allowed by MediaWiki[1]: class: one or more classifications to which the element belongs. See Wikipedia:Catalogue of CSS classes. dir: text direction— "ltr" (left-to-right), "rtl" (right-to-left) or "auto". id: unique identifier for the element. lang: primary language for the contents of the element per BCP 47. style: applies CSS styling to the contents of the element. title: advisory information associated with the element. HTML5 microdata attributes apply to all tags:[2] Any attribute beginning with data- itemid itemprop itemref itemscope itemtype Other tags such as <table> support specific attributes – these are listed in the appropriate section. Markup Renders as This is <span style="color:red;">red</span> text.
 This is red text. The MediaWiki Sanitizer.php does some cleanup on attributes. A best practice is to use the proper syntax. Discards attributes not on a whitelist for the given element. Turns broken or invalid entities into plaintext. Double-quotes all attribute values. Attributes without values are given the name as value. Double attributes are discarded. Unsafe style attributes are discarded. Prepends space if there are attributes. Elements These HTML elements are supported by the MediaWiki software. This section gives a brief overview of the HTML element, an example, relevant wikimarkup and templates. Basic h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 Further information: Help:Section and MOS:HEAD The <h1>...</h1> through <h6>...</h6> tags are headings for the sections with which they are associated. <h1> is used for the article title. Headings are styled through CSS and added to the page's table of contents. Markup Renders as <h1>Heading 1</h1>

<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6> Heading 1 Heading 2 Heading 3 Heading 4 Heading 5 Heading 6 Wikimarkup: surround the text with the appropriate number of equal signs. Headers formatted with wikimarkup add an [edit] link. Markup Renders as = Heading 1 =

Markup Renders as HyperText Markup Language

HyperText Markup Language HyperText Markup Language HyperText Markup Language <p>...</p> is especially useful in lists, for list items with multiple paragraphs: Markup Renders as * <p>This is a paragraph.</p><p>This is another paragraph in the same item.</p>
* This is a different item.
 This is a paragraph. This is another paragraph in the same item. This is a different item. Note that the closing tag </p> is not strictly necessary for MediaWiki installations that output HTML 5 (such as Wikipedia). br Further information: Help:Line-break handling § <br>, and Wikipedia:Don't use line breaks <br> inserts a line break. See H:BR for the other 4 versions that the MediaWiki software converts to <br /> in the HTML that browsers read. Markup Renders as HyperText<br>Markup Language HyperText Markup Language Templates: {{break}} adds multiple line breaks. {{crlf2}} adds a true carriage return and line feed. {{clear}} adds a break with styling to clear floating elements. {{plainlist}} creates an unbulleted list. hr Further information: WP:LINE <hr> or <hr /> represents a paragraph-level thematic break and presents as a horizontal rule. Markup Renders as <hr /> Wikimarkup: use ---- Markup Renders as ---- Templates: {{hr}} Comments Further information: WP:COMMENT <!--...--> formats the enclosed text as a hidden comment. Markup Renders as HyperText<!--Markup Language--> HyperText Be careful with spacing around comments. Surrounding a comment with blank lines will result in a blank paragraph, perceived as an extra two blank lines: Markup Renders as Content line 1

For other specialized quotation templates, see Category:Quotation templates. cite <cite>...</cite> contains the title of a work. This is a new definition in HTML5— in the previous XML implementation <cite> was used to contain a citation or a reference to other sources. No formatting is applied when this tag is used. Markup Renders as <cite>HyperText Markup Language</cite> HyperText Markup Language <cite>...</cite> is generally not used directly in Wikipedia articles, and is often misused; see Wikipedia:HTML 5#cite for replacement instructions. code <code>...</code> formats a section of computer code.
