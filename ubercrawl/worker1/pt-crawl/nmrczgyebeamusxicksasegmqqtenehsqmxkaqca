He took the nominally civilian role of prime minister of Myanmar in August 2021. He has led the Tatmadaw (military), an independent branch of government, as the commander-in-chief of Defence Services since March 2011, when he was handpicked to succeed longtime military ruler Than Shwe, who transferred leadership over the country to a civilian government upon retiring.[3][4][5] Before assuming leadership over the Tatmadaw, Min Aung Hlaing served as Joint Chief of Staff from 2010 to 2011. Born in Minbu, Burma, Min Aung Hlaing studied law at the Rangoon Arts and Science University before joining the military. Rising through its ranks, he became a five-star general by 2013.[6][better source needed] During the period of civilian rule from 2011 to 2021, Min Aung Hlaing worked to ensure the military's continued role in politics and forestalled the peace process with ethnic armed groups. A United Nations fact-finding mission found he deliberately perpetrated the Rohingya genocide. He maintained an adversarial relationship with democratically-elected State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, though she defended him against genocide charges.[7] Baselessly claiming widespread voting irregularities and electoral fraud in the 2020 Myanmar general election in which Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy won a landslide re-election, Min Aung Hlaing seized power from her in the 2021 coup.[8][9][10] He had been expected to run for president of Myanmar had the military proxy party, the Union Solidarity and Development Party, won enough seats in parliament to elect him, and would have been required to retire as Commander-in-Chief due to a constitutional age limit.[11] With the outbreak of mass protests against his rule, Min Aung Hlaing ordered a clampdown and suppression of demonstrations,[12] sparking an ongoing civil war.[13] Min Aung Hlaing's forces have employed scorched earth tactics in the civil war, including airstrikes on civilians.[14][15] He has ordered the execution of prominent democracy activists, the first use of the death penalty in decades.[16][17] In foreign policy, he has resisted influence from ASEAN and relied on greater cooperation with Russia, China, and India.[18][19] In response to his human rights abuses and corruption, Min Aung Hlaing and his government have been subjected to an extensive series of international sanctions, returning Myanmar to its former status as a pariah state. The 2022 Democracy Index rated Myanmar under Min Aung Hlaing as the second-most authoritarian regime in the world, with only Afghanistan rated less democratic.[20] Early life and education Min Aung Hlaing was born on 3 July 1956 in Minbu, Magway Region, Burma to Khin Hlaing and Hla Mu, as the fourth of five children.[21] His parents were teachers from Dawei, in Tanintharyi Region.[22] His family moved to Mandalay as duty when he was 5 years. His father, Khin Hlaing, was an artist.[23] Min Aung Hlaing passed his matriculation exam in 1972 at BEHS 1 Latha of Rangoon (now Yangon).[24][25] He attended and studied law at the Rangoon Arts and Science University from 1973 to 1974. On his third attempt, he was admitted to the Defence Services Academy in 1974 as part of the 19th Intake, and he graduated in 1977.[26][27] According to classmates, Min Aung Hlaing was taciturn, and an unremarkable cadet.[28] He was reportedly shunned by classmates because of his reserved personality.[24] Career Following graduation, Min Aung Hlaing went on to serve in different command positions, rising slowly through the ranks.[28] Early in his career, military colleagues gave him a nickname referring to cat feces, "something deposited quietly but leaving a powerful stink."[29] As he rose through the ranks, Min Aung Hlaing earned a reputation as a hardliner.[24] His military work earned him the favour of Senior General Than Shwe.[30] Min Aung Hlaing is characterized as having a "big man" management style not conducive to collaboration or listening.[30] In 2002, he was promoted to commander of the Triangle Regional Command [my] in Eastern Shan State and was a central figure in negotiations with two rebel groups, the United Wa State Army (UWSA) and the National Democratic Alliance Army (NDAA).[24] Min Aung Hlaing was reportedly close with former Thai prime minister and General Prem Tinsulanonda, considering Prem a father figure.[31][32] Min Aung Hlaing supported the military crackdown of the Saffron Revolution in 2008.[24] He rose to prominence in 2009 after leading an offensive against the insurgent Myanmar Nationalities Democratic Alliance Army in Kokang.[33] In June 2010, Min Aung Hlaing replaced General Shwe Mann as Joint Chief of Staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.[24] Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces 2011–2015: Union Solidarity and Development Party rule In the lead-up to 2011, the military began embarking on a series of political reforms to transition Myanmar to a quasi-democracy. The ruling junta, the State Peace and Development Council, engineered its formal departure from power, after holding the 2010 Myanmar general election, which was won by the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), the military's proxy party. On 30 March 2011, outgoing head of state, Senior General Than Shwe, then the incumbent Commander-in-Chief of Myanmar's Armed Forces, appointed Min Aung Hlaing as his successor, ahead of more senior officers.[34][35] Min Aung Hlaing's appointment coincided with USDP's rise to power, during which he oversaw a series of military reforms, and supported efforts by the USDP-led government to strike peace deals with ethnic armed groups.[34] In November 2011, according to The Irrawaddy News, it was "widely believed" that following Min Aung Hlaing's meetings with Chinese military officials that month and his leadership in creating a bilateral agreement on defense cooperation with the Chinese, he had also held talks with Chinese vice-president Xi Jinping regarding cooperation from China with respect to the Kachin Conflict.[33] On 27 March 2012, during a speech in Naypyidaw, Min Aung Hlaing defended the military's continued role in national politics.[33][36] On 3 April 2012, the Government of Myanmar announced that Min Aung Hlaing had been promoted to vice-senior general, the second highest rank in Myanmar's Armed Forces.[33] He was promoted to senior general in March 2013. In 2014, as Min Aung Hlaing approached the age of 60, which is the mandatory age of retirement for military officers, the Armed Forces' Department of Defence Council issued a directive, enabling Min Aung Hlaing to extend his mandatory retirement age to 65, in 2021.[37] In August 2015, the USDP fractured, and President Thein Sein purged the faction led by Shwe Mann, a former general and Speaker of the Pyithu Hluttaw.[34] Min Aung Hlaing oversaw a direct military intervention to oust Shwe Mann from power, indicating the military's desire to continue furthering its agenda through USDP.[38] Shwe Mann had advocated for legislation and constitutional amendments that would have decreased the military's influence, against the interests of the military and USDP.[38] 2016–2020: Transition to National League for Democracy rule Min Aung Hlaing meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on 29 July 2015 Min Aung Hlaing meeting with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar on 20 March 2017 The 2015 Myanmar general election saw the National League for Democracy (NLD), led by Aung San Suu Kyi, win in a landslide. With the transition from an USDP to NLD-led government, Min Aung Hlaing shifted his priorities to recovering state power for the military establishment.[34] His intransigence and refusal to cooperate with the civilian-led government undermined progress toward Myanmar's peace process.[34] As the NLD assumed power, Min Aung Hlaing began intensifying an ongoing military crackdown on the Rohingya, beginning in October 2016.[39][40] At the Union Peace Conference - 21st Century Panglong in August 2020, he sharply warned the NLD against scapegoating the military for its role in the ongoing ethnic conflicts.[41] Min Aung Hlaing meeting with Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu Min Aung Hlaing also began to signal his interest in civilian politics.[34] He began assuming a more sta contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 49 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Min_Aung_Hlaing responseCode 3 200
