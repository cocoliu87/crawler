It began on 24 February 2022, as part of the northern Ukraine offensive, during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. On 4 April 2022, Ukrainian authorities stated that the Russian military had left Chernihiv Oblast.[19] Initial battle[edit] On 24 February 2022, at 03:27 EET (UTC+2), a captain and a corporal from the Russian 11th Guards Air Assault Brigade surrendered to elements of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (ZSU) near Chernihiv.[1] On the same day, Ukraine claimed a reconnaissance platoon of the Russian 74th Motorized Rifle Brigade had also surrendered.[4] The same day, the Ukrainian military repelled a Russian attack in Chernihiv and seized Russian equipment and documents.[20] According to the British Ministry of Defence, Russian forces had failed to capture the city and instead opted to bypass the city through an alternative route to Kyiv.[21][22] Ukrainian officials reported that the Russian forces were heading towards the nearby towns of Sedniv and Semenivka.[23] Siege[edit] Chernihiv residential building after Russian shelling on 3 March Russian plane shot down on 5 March Ukrainian firefighters try to put out diesel fuel tanks attacked by Russia in Chernihiv February[edit] On 25 February 2022, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced that Russian forces had surrounded Chernihiv and were laying siege to the city.[24] The next day, Ukrainian forces claimed the defeat of a Russian military unit that attempted to capture the city. Several Russian tanks were allegedly seized by Ukrainian forces.[25] The Ukrainian government also said that Russian BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launchers (MRL) hit hospitals and kindergartens in Chernihiv, though this claim was not independently verified.[26] That day, an archive of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) was bombed by Russian forces.[27][28] On 27 February, Ukrainian officials said that Russian forces damaged most of Chernihiv's city center with missiles, and destroyed the historic Shchors cinema.[29][30] Russian forces later claimed that they had completely blockaded the city.[31] Ukrainian sources also claimed that 56 Russian fuel trucks were destroyed by Ukrainian forces.[32] On 28 February, the village of Kyinka came under fire. Cluster munitions repudiated by most countries were used in the attack.[33] Saboteurs with the support of armored vehicles also tried to break into Chernihiv; they were found and killed in the outskirts of Chernihiv.[34] March[edit] Chernihiv residential building burning on 6 March On 1 March, Ukrainian officials stated that Belarus joined the Russian invasion and was sending a column of military vehicles towards Chernihiv from the Belarusian city of Grodno. US officials disagreed with this claim, stating that there was "no indication" that Belarus had invaded.[35] Vyacheslav Chaus, the governor of Chernihiv Oblast, stated that every access point to the city was heavily mined.[36] On 2 March, the mayor of Chernihiv, Vladyslav Atroshenko, predicted that urban warfare in the city was possible.[37] Two missiles hit a hospital in the city during the day, according to the health administration chief Serhiy Pivovar.[38] On 3 March, a Russian airstrike was reported to have hit residential buildings and two schools.[39][40] Around 47 people were reported killed.[41] On 5 March, on the outskirts of Chernihiv, in Masany, the Ukrainian military shot down a Russian attack aircraft; both pilots were captured.[42] On 6 March, as of the morning, 141 settlements in the region were left without electricity. Attacks continued as the Russian Air Force dropped heavy bombs intended for fortifications on residential buildings.[43] The city received humanitarian aid (food, medicine, etc). Due to the threat of shelling, the trucks were immediately unloaded.[44] On 10 March, Mayor Vladyslav Atroshenko said that Russian forces had completed the encirclement of Chernihiv, adding that the city was completely isolated and critical infrastructure for its 300,000 residents was rapidly failing as it came under repeated bombardment.[45] A Russian airstrike also damaged the Chernihiv Arena.[46] On 11 March, the Chernihiv Stadium and a library were badly damaged by a Russian airstrike.[47] The "Hotel Ukraine" building in the city was destroyed on 12 March.[48] Ukrainian forces later claimed to have destroyed a Russian missile unit shelling the city, with some Russian troops surrendering.[49] On 13 March, a Russian airstrike at 05:46 hit a dormitory,[50] killing five civilians according to the State Emergency Services.[51] A church on the cemetery Yatsevo was destroyed by shelling[52] (about 3,000 graves on this cemetery were also damaged during the siege).[53] Ukrainian forces later claimed to have shot down a Russian fighter jet while it was bombing Chernihiv.[54] On 14 March, Chaus stated that Russian airstrikes had destroyed the Chernihiv Polytechnic National University.[55] The Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine stated that ten civilians were killed during the shelling of the city.[56] Near Chernihiv, the Ukrainian military defeated an enemy tank unit that was to participate in an attack on Kyiv.[57] On 16 March, a Russian attack killed at least 18 and injured 26 civilians, who were waiting in a line for bread.[58] On 25 March, Ukrainian authorities said that Russian forces had cut-off the northern city of Chernihiv after destroying a road bridge Across the Desna in the south,[59] while attempts to fully encircle the city remained unsuccessful.[60] On 30 March 2022, the Korolenko Chernihiv Regional Universal Scientific Library was bombed, along with the market in the city center.[61][62][63] Also a specialized table tennis hall in the Khimik Sport Complex was hit by the Russian army.
