He is a member of the Deutsche Filmakademie and the German Academy for Football Culture. Background[edit] Aljoscha Pause was born on 24 January 1972 in Bonn, Germany. After he graduated high school, he studied romance philology in Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms University. Pause received narration training at Deutsche Welle from 1998 until 2002. Throughout his college years, Pause worked at Pantheon, a cabaret theater founded by his father, Rainer Pause. During this time he also began working as a reporter for a local magazine and a broadcaster at a private radio station (Radio Bonn/Rhein-Sieg). He began his television career at age 24. Pause served as a sports reporter at German Sports Television (now Sport1) from 1996 to 1999. Following that, he worked as a reporter for the main sports desk at Kirch Media Group, Sat.1 until 2003. Pause also worked as a filmmaker, presenter, commentator, and field reporter for Premiere (now Sky Germany). Additionally, he held the position of a reporter for LIGA total!, the Bundesliga broadcaster of Deutsche Telekom, from 2009 until 2011. Today, Pause lives with his wife and two daughters in Bonn. Cinematic works[edit] In 2003, Pause became an independent filmmaker and producer. He is known for his longer documentary films primarily focusing on the sociopolitical aspects of sports (e.g. homophobia in football, hooliganism in sports, alcohol consumption in football, and the German Football League for the Blind). Pause is also known for his portrait documentaries, whose subjects are usually football players, but also include the actor Michael Jäger (an ex-hooligan who starred in the early-evening soap opera Marienhof).[1] His first two full-length feature films, Tom meets Zizou) (2011) and Trainer! (2013) received acclaim from film critics internationally. In 2010, he received the Grimme Prize for producing a TV documentary series he produced about homophobia in football. Trilogy – Homophobia in Football (2008–2011)[edit] Created for Sky One and DSF with the support of the German Academy for Football Culture, Pause produced a three-part TV documentary series on homophobia in football filmed over the course of three years. The trilogy included The Great Taboo (2008), Breaking the Taboo (2009), and Football is Everything--Even Gay (2011). The Great Taboo: Homophobia in Football (2008) premiered on DSF in 2008. The first investigative TV documentary on the subject to gain traction, it featured the stories of LGBTQ+ athletes like Tanja Walther and Anouschka Bernhard, who are both lesbians, and referee Marie Karsten, who is transgender. The Great Taboo (2008) won the 2008 Felix Rexhausen Award from the Association of Lesbian and Gay Journalists (Bund Lesbischer und Schwuler Journalistlnnen, or BLSJ, the German affiliate of the NLGJA).[2] The judges described it as an "honest, dispassionate stock-taking" of the LGBTQ+ experience for athletes in Germany "...[a]s informative as it is sober... [which] subtly reveals how widespread anti-gay feeling is in the world of football--on every level." In 2009, Pause and DSF released the second installment of the three-part series, Breaking Taboo: The New Progress of Homosexuality in Football (2009). The film picks up one year after the release of its first installment, investigating developments in the German Football Association since the uptick of popular interest following the first film in 2008. In 2010, Breaking Taboo earned Pause an Alternative Media Prize[3] and the Grimme Prize in the category for "Information & Culture/Special."[4] In March 2011, Pause released the final installment, entitled Football ls Everything--Even Gay (2011).
