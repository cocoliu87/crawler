He faced accusations of grave violations, including war crimes and genocide, in the Darfur region during the war in Darfur and battle of Geneina including the Killing of Khamis Abakar. During the 2023 Sudan conflict, the Darfur Bar Association called for international prosecution and UN intervention in June 2023. Jumma's actions within the RSF sparked controversy due to their involvement in conflicts leading to unrest and displacement. In August 2023, the RSF's War Crimes Committee, led by Sudan's Transitional Sovereignty Council, listed Jumma among wanted individuals, emphasising crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide allegations. Biography[edit] Abdel Rahman Jumma Barak Allah Ahmad[1] is from Ed Daein, East Darfur.[2] He is a Major General of Rapid Support Forces (RSF), involved in the Battle of Geneina as the Commander of the Rapid Support Forces, West Darfur Sector.[3][4] Jumma was the RSF Commander in West Darfur and appeared in videos related to the arrest of the West Darfur governor, Khamis Abbakar, before his killing, sparking accusations from the Sudanese army.[5] General Jumma, as part of the RSF, has been involved in conflicts in the Darfur region, leading to significant unrest and displacement.[6] Jumma's role within the RSF has attracted attention due to its controversial actions and their impact on the region.[7][8] In June 2023, the Darfur Bar Association called for human rights organisations to launch a campaign to criminally prosecute Abdel Rahman Jumma and Al-Tijani Al-Taher Karshoum, Deputy Governor of West Darfur , alleging grave violations against civilians, including war crimes and genocide. They are seeking intervention from the United Nations to halt these abuses.[9] Jumma is also accused of preventing citizens from leaving El Geneina,[10] and the West Darfur Revolutionaries Bloc condemns his statements about peaceful coexistence, pointing to his involvement in systematic violence and displacement against civilians.[11] They argue that the conflict is not tribal but a systematic genocide perpetrated by militias and Rapid Support forces. The Association is pushing for international criminal cases, classifying the events in West Darfur as crimes against humanity, highlighting the need for justice and accountability.[9] In August 2023, the War Crimes, Violations, and Practices Committee of the RSF, established by the Chairman of the Transitional Sovereignty Council in Sudan, has released a list of names of individuals deemed wanted for justice. Notable figures on this list include the Commander of the Rapid Support Forces, Mohamed Hamdan "Hemedti," his deputy Abdel-Rahim Dagalo, Jumma, and Al-Tijani Al-Taher Karshoum. This list comprises 46 individuals, including some tribal leaders. The committee, led by the Public Prosecutor, has called for the surrender of these wanted persons. The committee's mandate is to investigate allegations of crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide attributed to the Rapid Support Forces, and it includes representatives from various government agencies and bodies.[12] References[edit] ^ "قائد قوات الدعم السريع قطاع جنوب دارفور السابق العميد عبد الرحمن جمعة بارك الله – صحيفة الصيحة" (in Arabic).
