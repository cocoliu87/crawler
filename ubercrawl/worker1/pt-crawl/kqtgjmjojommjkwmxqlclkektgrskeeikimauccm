Closure under addition and subtraction means that a lattice must be a subgroup of the additive group of the points in the space, and the requirements of minimum and maximum distance can be summarized by saying that a lattice is a Delone set. More abstractly, a lattice can be described as a free abelian group of dimension n {\displaystyle n} which spans the vector space R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} . For any basis of R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} , the subgroup of all linear combinations with integer coefficients of the basis vectors forms a lattice, and every lattice can be formed from a basis in this way. A lattice may be viewed as a regular tiling of a space by a primitive cell. Lattices have many significant applications in pure mathematics, particularly in connection to Lie algebras, number theory and group theory. They also arise in applied mathematics in connection with coding theory, in percolation theory to study connectivity arising from small-scale interactions, cryptography because of conjectured computational hardness of several lattice problems, and are used in various ways in the physical sciences. For instance, in materials science and solid-state physics, a lattice is a synonym for the framework of a crystalline structure, a 3-dimensional array of regularly spaced points coinciding in special cases with the atom or molecule positions in a crystal. More generally, lattice models are studied in physics, often by the techniques of computational physics. Symmetry considerations and examples[edit] A lattice is the symmetry group of discrete translational symmetry in n directions. A pattern with this lattice of translational symmetry cannot have more, but may have less symmetry than the lattice itself.[1] As a group (dropping its geometric structure) a lattice is a finitely-generated free abelian group, and thus isomorphic to Z n {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} ^{n}} . A lattice in the sense of a 3-dimensional array of regularly spaced points coinciding with e.g. the atom or molecule positions in a crystal, or more generally, the orbit of a group action under translational symmetry, is a translation of the translation lattice: a coset, which need not contain the origin, and therefore need not be a lattice in the previous sense. A simple example of a lattice in R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} is the subgroup Z n {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} ^{n}} . More complicated examples include the E8 lattice, which is a lattice in R 8 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{8}} , and the Leech lattice in R 24 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{24}} . The period lattice in R 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}} is central to the study of elliptic functions, developed in nineteenth century mathematics; it generalizes to higher dimensions in the theory of abelian functions. Lattices called root lattices are important in the theory of simple Lie algebras; for example, the E8 lattice is related to a Lie algebra that goes by the same name. Dividing space according to a lattice[edit] A typical lattice Λ {\displaystyle \Lambda } in R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} thus has the form Λ = { ∑ i = 1 n a i v i | a i ∈ Z } {\displaystyle \Lambda =\left\{\left.\sum _{i=1}^{n}a_{i}v_{i}\;\right\vert \;a_{i}\in \mathbb {Z} \right\}} where {v1, ..., vn} is a basis for R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} . Different bases can generate the same lattice, but the absolute value of the determinant of the vectors vi is uniquely determined by Λ, and is denoted by d(Λ). If one thinks of a lattice as dividing the whole of R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} into equal polyhedra (copies of an n-dimensional parallelepiped, known as the fundamental region of the lattice), then d(Λ) is equal to the n-dimensional volume of this polyhedron. This is why d(Λ) is sometimes called the covolume of the lattice. If this equals 1, the lattice is called unimodular. Lattice points in convex sets[edit] Minkowski's theorem relates the number d(Λ) and the volume of a symmetric convex set S to the number of lattice points contained in S. The number of lattice points contained in a polytope all of whose vertices are elements of the lattice is described by the polytope's Ehrhart polynomial. Formulas for some of the coefficients of this polynomial involve d(Λ) as well. See also: Integer points in polyhedra Computational lattice problems[edit] Main article: Lattice problem Computational lattice problems have many applications in computer science. For example, the Lenstra–Lenstra–Lovász lattice basis reduction algorithm (LLL) has been used in the cryptanalysis of many public-key encryption schemes,[2] and many lattice-based cryptographic schemes are known to be secure under the assumption that certain lattice problems are computationally difficult.[3] Lattices in two dimensions: detailed discussion[edit] Five lattices in the Euclidean plane There are five 2D lattice types as given by the crystallographic restriction theorem. Below, the wallpaper group of the lattice is given in IUCr notation, Orbifold notation, and Coxeter notation, along with a wallpaper diagram showing the symmetry domains. Note that a pattern with this lattice of translational symmetry cannot have more, but may have less symmetry than the lattice itself. A full list of subgroups is available. For example below the hexagonal/triangular lattice is given twice, with full 6-fold and a half 3-fold reflectional symmetry. If the symmetry group of a pattern contains an n-fold rotation then the lattice has n-fold symmetry for even n and 2n-fold for odd n. cmm, (2*22), [∞,2+,∞] p4m, (*442), [4,4] p6m, (*632), [6,3] rhombic lattice also centered rectangular lattice isosceles triangular square lattice right isosceles triangular hexagonal lattice (equilateral triangular lattice) pmm, *2222, [∞,2,∞] p2, 2222, [∞,2,∞]+ p3m1, (*333), [3[3]] rectangular lattice also centered rhombic lattice right triangular oblique lattice scalene triangular equilateral triangular lattice (hexagonal lattice) For the classification of a given lattice, start with one point and take a nearest second point. For the third point, not on the same line, consider its distances to both points. Among the points for which the smaller of these two distances is least, choose a point for which the larger of the two is least. (Not logically equivalent but in the case of lattices giving the same result is just "Choose a point for which the larger of the two is least".) The five cases correspond to the triangle being equilateral, right isosceles, right, isosceles, and scalene. In a rhombic lattice, the shortest distance may either be a diagonal or a side of the rhombus, i.e., the line segment connecting the first two points may or may not be one of the equal sides of the isosceles triangle. This depends on the smaller angle of the rhombus being less than 60° or between 60° and 90°. The general case is known as a period lattice. If the vectors p and q generate the lattice, instead of p and q we can also take p and p-q, etc. In general in 2D, we can take a p + b q and c p + d q for integers a,b, c and d such that ad-bc is 1 or -1. This ensures that p and q themselves are integer linear combinations of the other two vectors. Each pair p, q defines a parallelogram, all with the same area, the magnitude of the cross product. One parallelogram fully defines the whole object. Without further symmetry, this parallelogram is a fundamental parallelogram. The fundamental domain of the period lattice. The vectors p and q can be represented by complex numbers. Up to size and orientation, a pair can be represented by their quotient. Expressed geometrically: if two lattice points are 0 and 1, we consider the position of a third lattice point. Equivalence in the sense of generating the same lattice is represented by the modular group: T : z contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 49 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Lattice_(group) responseCode 3 200
