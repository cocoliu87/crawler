Twelve teams took part in the thirteen-day tournament—the ten Test-playing nations and the finalists of the 2007 WCL Division One tournament: Kenya and Scotland. India won the tournament, beating Pakistan in the final.[2] Rules and regulations[edit] ICC World T20 2007 BAN vs RSA During the group stage and Super Eight, points were awarded to the teams as follows: Results Points Win 2 points No result 1 point Loss 0 points In case of a tie (i.e., both teams score exactly the same number of runs at the end of their respective innings), a bowl-out decided the winner. This was applicable in all stages of the tournament.[3] The bowl-out was used to determine the result of only one game in this tournament – the Group D game between India and Pakistan on 14 September (scorecard). Within each group (both group stage and Super Eight stage), teams were ranked against each other based on the following criteria:[4] Higher number of points If equal, higher number of wins If still equal, higher net run rate If still equal, lower bowling strike rate If still equal, result of head-to-head meeting.
