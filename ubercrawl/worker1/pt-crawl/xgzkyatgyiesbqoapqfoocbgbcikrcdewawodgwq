History[edit] In 1983, the Wisma Indonesia building was demolished and a shopping mall, The Wisma, was built over the site.[3][4] The developer of the mall was Wisma Development Pte Ltd, a subsidiary of A. W. Galadari Pte Ltd, a Dubai company owned by the Galadari brothers.[3] In 1984, after Abdul Wahab Galadari's assets were seized by the United Arab Emirates's government over the Union Bank of the Middle East's dealings, one of many Galadari's companies, A. W. Galadari Pte Ltd was taken over by Dubai Bank Ltd, a bank owned by A. W. Galadari's brothers.[5] In 1985, the mall was renamed to Wisma Atria after the Union Bank of the Middle East took over Dubai Bank Ltd.[4] Wisma Atria underwent renovations in 2004 by local architect cum designers DP Architects. Notable changes include the replacement of the original blue facade with clear glass, a new Grand Entrance facing Orchard Road on Level 2, new large Wisma Atria signage on a new blue grid structure facing Orchard Road and external lighted escalators on the facade leading to Levels 3 and 4.
