Operational demands eventually outstripped their abilities, and the superior operational and diplomatic benefits of a paramilitary organization were recognized.[4] On 14 March 2019, Myanmar's deputy defence minister submitted a proposal to the Pyithu Hluttaw to establish a national coast guard.[5] The then-civilian government was making efforts to "civilianize" national security affairs and therefore wanted to establish the coast guard under either the Ministry of Transport and Communications or the President's Office.[4] However, according to the 2008 Constitution, all of Myanmar's armed forces are controlled by the Chief of Defence Services.[6] Establishment[edit] Initiated by the Aung San Suu Kyi-led NLD government in 2018,[7] the Myanmar Coast Guard was formally established on 6 October 2021[8] at Thilawa Port in Thanlyin[9] by Min Aung Hlaing, the ruling junta of the country since the February coup.[10] It operates under the Ministry of Defence, in close cooperation with the Myanmar Navy, the Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries and Rural Development, the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development and the Myanmar Police Force. The new force's remit is to guard Myanmar's 1930 km of coastal territory and its territorial waters, which encompass 23,070 km2 and about 1000 islands.[7] Vessels[edit] The Myanmar Coast Guard started out with four former Navy patrol vessels.[11] These vessels bear the pennant numbers P 311, P 312, P 411 and P 412.[1] Patrol vessels[edit] Type Builder No Start using date Arms Remark PGM 43 class[citation needed] Marinette Marine, Wisconsin; last two by Peterson Builders, Sturgeon Bay, WI, United States P-411 P-412 1959-1961 1x25mm Twin Barrel AA Gun, 2xMA15 Machine Gun Fast Patrol Vessels[edit] Type Builder No Start using year Arms Remark 5 series class[citation needed] Myanmar Naval Dockyard P-311 P-312 P-313 2013-2014 2x25 mm Twin Barrel AA Gun, 2x14.5 mm Single Barrel Gun (DI) References[edit] ^ a b "Myanmar inaugurates coastguard service with initial fleet of four vessels".
