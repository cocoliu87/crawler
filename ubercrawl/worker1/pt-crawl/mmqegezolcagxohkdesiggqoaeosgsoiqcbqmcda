Although Wikipedia strives for writing common to all varieties of English, some spelling, grammar or terminology it uses may be different or otherwise absent in yours.

Purge the Main Page Purge this page Where is the error? An exact quotation of all or part of the text in question will help. Please offer a correction if possible. References are helpful, especially when reporting an obscure factual or grammatical error. Time zones: The Main Page runs on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC, currently 23:05 on 20 November 2023), not adjusted to your local time zone. Do not use {{edit fully-protected}} on this page, which will not give you a faster response; it is unnecessary as this page is not protected and will in fact cause problems if used here. (See the bottom of this revision for an example.) Done? Once an error has been fixed, rotated off the Main Page or acknowledged not to be an error, the report will be removed from this page; please check the revision history for a record of any discussion or action taken, as no archives are kept. No chit-chat: Lengthy discussions should be moved to a suitable location elsewhere, such as the relevant article or project talk page. Please respect other editors. A real person wrote the blurb or hook for which you are suggesting a fix, or a real person noticed what they honestly believe is an issue with the blurb or hook that you wrote. Everyone is interested in creating the best Main Page possible; with the compressed time frame, there is sometimes more stress and more opportunities to step on toes. Please be civil to fellow users. Can you resolve the problem yourself? If the error lies primarily in the content of an article linked from the Main Page, consider first attempting to fix the problem there before reporting it here if necessary. Text on the Main Page generally defers to the articles with bolded links. In addition, upcoming content is typically only protected from editing 24 hours before its scheduled appearance; in most cases, you can be bold and fix any issues yourself.

Current DYK Boloco: article says 4 locations remain, hook says 2. -BRAINULATOR9 (TALK) 01:20, 20 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Article has been corrected and now matches the hook. Schwede66 02:01, 20 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] I've reverted the change; it's the hook that's wrong. There are four locations currently open (see the official website), with two set to close before the end of the year. Sojourner in the earth (talk) 07:55, 20 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Alright then. I went by the secondary source and that said two. Given that you can place online orders via their website, the four sites will presumably be correct. I’ll change the hook. Schwede66 08:54, 20 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] In fact, the secondary source says that there will be two stores left by the end of 2023... apparently the Boston Common and Congress Street outlets will be closing some time soon, but haven't done so yet. So there's no discrepancy. We could amend the hook to use the secondary verified assertion of there being two by the end of the year... or just leave it as four. I'm not fussed either way. — Amakuru (talk) 13:46, 20 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Next DYK Next-but-one DYK Errors in "On this day" Today's OTD Does it really make sense to bold Prince Phillip instead of the marriage?
