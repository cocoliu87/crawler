In 1864 the family migrated to Melbourne, where he was educated at St Patrick's College, East Melbourne and Xavier College.[3] He played for the Melbourne Cricket Club First XI while still at Xavier, and made his first-class debut for Victoria at the age of 17.[5] McDonnell was an attacking batsman and his averages are among the very best of his era. His top Test score of 147[6] was made in a partnership of 199 with Alick Bannerman at the SCG when the other 9 batsman in the team contributed 29 to the team score.[7] In 1886/87, McDonnell became the first Test captain ever to win the toss and elect to field. He had mixed results. England were dismissed for just 45, but nonetheless won the match.[8] McDonnell died of cardiac failure[3] at his South Brisbane residence[9] aged 37 and his funeral proceeded from there to the Toowong Cemetery.[10][11] Gallery[edit] 1888 Australian team in England, captained by Percy McDonnell Percy McDonnell's Test career batting graph.
