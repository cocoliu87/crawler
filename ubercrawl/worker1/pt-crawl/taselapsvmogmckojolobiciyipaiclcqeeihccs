It is being fought over the city of Avdiivka, located in the Donbas region.[8] Fighting started when violence erupted in the Donbas again on 21 February 2022, when Russian president Vladimir Putin recognized the Donetsk People's Republic.[9] Days later, when Russia invaded Ukraine, Avdiivka was among the first places to be attacked.[10] Avdiivka has been described as a "gateway" to Russia-occupied Donetsk, and continued Ukrainian control of the city has prevented Russia from using nearby Donetsk and its resources as a communications hub.[11] However, Avdiivka is one of the most fortified settlements in Ukraine, which has prevented Russia from breaking through, despite heavy fighting for over a year.[12][11][13] Background Further information: Battle of Avdiivka (2017) Avdiivka is a strategic location in the heart of the Donetsk region, near Donetsk, the region's principal city.[13] Avdiivka has been at the front lines of the Russo-Ukrainian War since 2015.[8] In 2017 the battle of Avdiivka resulted in destruction in the town, though Ukrainian forces still held it.[8] Battle Early fighting (21 February – 17 April 2022) Fighting began on 21 February 2022, when Russian forces alongside separatist militias renewed fighting in Avdiivka.[10] When Russia officially started its invasion of Ukraine, Avdiivka was one of its main targets. On 13 March, Russian forces bombed the Avdiivka Coke Plant[14] although the Russians accused Ukraine of sabotaging it.[15] The National Police of Ukraine said on 22 March that Russia used Tornado-S MLRSs in bombardments of Avdiivka, allegedly causing civilian casualties.[16] It was reported on 25 March that Artem Murakhovskyi, a commander of the Azov Regiment, was killed in Avdiivka.[17] Escalation (18 April – 27 July 2022) Avdiivka 1st school after shelling by white phosphorus munitions On 18 April, Russia renewed its invasion on Eastern Ukraine, with both sides proclaiming the beginning of the "battle of Donbas" and Russia beginning to heavily shell and attack Avdiivka.[18][19][20] Around 2,000 of Avdiivka's residents were forced to flee underground.[21][22][23] Ukraine claimed to have repelled Russian advances in Avdiivka on 19 April.[24] During the battle, use of white phosphorus munitions by Russian forces was reported several times. Governor of Donetsk Oblast Pavlo Kyrylenko reported a phosphorus attack on the city industrial zone on 26 March,[25] on the area of the coking plant on 26 April, and on the city center, causing several fires, the next day.[26][27] On 29 April, videos of the Russian army shelling Ukrainian forces in Avdiivka with a thermobaric weapon were published.[28] On 18 May, Avdiivka 1st school was destroyed by a Russian attack with phosphorus munitions.[29][30] On May 26, Ukraine's General Staff reported that Russian forces were advancing through Avdiivka, capturing many areas in the city.[31] On 1 June, the DPR took control of a major highway.[32] On 6 June, the DPR took territory near Kamianka.[citation needed] On 12 June, Russia again bombed the Avdiivka Coke Plant.[33] School No. 6 was destroyed on 21 June, being the third school destroyed in Avdiivka.[34] On 24 June, Russian forces fired on Avdiivka.[35] Russian forces later captured Novoselivka Druha on 4 July, which is 10 km northeast of Avdiivka, in an attempt to encircle the city.[36] On 7 July, Russian forces shelled Avdiivka for 24 hours. They hit infrastructure, a hospital, residential buildings, a bus depot, and the Avdiivka Coke Plant.[37] On 18 July, the DPR claimed it had "half-surrounded" Avdiivka, having blocked two of the roads leading into the town. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) an American based non-profit think-tank, also stated that fighting north of Avdiivka had intensified on July 18.[38] However, Igor Girkin said that the DPR's forces were unable to make many gains due to Ukrainian artillery.[39] Renewed assaults and capture of Pisky (28 July 2022 – March 2023) See also: Battle of Pisky On 28 July, DPR and Russian forces launched a offensive to surround Avdiivka. Russian and separatist forces assaulted the towns of Krasnohorivka, Pisky, and other towns north of Avdiivka.[40] On 31 July, the Head of the Avdiivka City Military Administration Vitalii Barabash said that only 10% of the pre-war population of Avdiivka remained, or about 2,500 people.[41] Ukraine said on 5 August that it lost the Butivka coal mine to Russia that was pushed to the outskirts of Avdiivka.[42][43] On August 7, combat footage showed that Russian forces had reached the centre of Pisky,[44] and they fully captured the entirety of Pisky by 24 August.[45] In early September, several separatist units, including the Sparta Battalion and Somalia Battalion, launched an attack in the wider Avdiivka area, most importantly near Pisky.[4] As of late September, the Wall Street Journal reported that Ukrainian forces "remain[ed] on the defensive" in Avdiivka.[46] On 10 October, Ukraine said Russia was continuing its offensive in Avdiivka and was trying to encircle the city.[47] In mid-January 2023, Russian and DNR forces made an attempt to capture the village of Vodyane, the action was described by a British military blogger as "calamitous".[48] Later encirclement attempts (March 2023 – October 2023) In March 2023 Ukrainian commander at Avdiivka said that Russian forces were trying to fully encircle the city.[49] On 24 April, the Ukrainians claimed to have repulsed a Russian attack, and to have killed or wounded 200 Russian soldiers and destroyed 20 pieces of equipment.[50] On 21 May, the Ukrainians claimed to have defeated a mechanized Russian assault near Avdiivka. During the engagement, they claimed to have killed 40 Russian soldiers and to have destroyed 5 armored vehicles, including at least two tanks.[51] Fighting in the battle intensified during the beginning of the 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive, with Russian forces putting pressure on the outskirts of the town and Ukrainians digging in.[52] On 10 September 2023, Avdiivka City Military Administration Head Vitaliy Barabash reported that Ukrainian forces had gained a foothold in the urban portion of the village of contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 75 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Battle_of_Avdiivka_(2022%E2%80%93present) responseCode 3 200
