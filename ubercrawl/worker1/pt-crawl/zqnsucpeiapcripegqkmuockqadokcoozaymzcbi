There are 17 autonomous communities and two autonomous cities (Melilla and Ceuta) in all these schemes. The third sphere, that of local entities and local government, comprises three different subdivisions of Spain, with differing political (council), electoral (constituency), or administrative (decentralised services of the state) functions as well as other entities described below. Accordingly Spain is divided territorially into: 8,131 municipalities and 3,683 sub-municipal entitles each with political, administrative and are their own constituencies. 465 comarcas, 83 of which have administrative and political functions 50 provinces, nine of which have no political or administrative function but all of which are constituencies for the national parliament. In practice most local government power is vested in municipalities; provinces are limited to providing support for smaller municipalities.[8][9][10][11][12] Nevertheless, and ignoring the lack of administrative function in nine provinces, taken together, the 50 provinces, 7 islands and two autonomous cities are defined as third-level subdivisions by NUTS and OECD. The 50 provinces by themselves are defined as second-level by FIPS, CIA World Factbook and ISO 3166-2. Comarcas are not featured in any of these schemes. Although municipalities are required by law to not cross provincial boundaries, comarcas have no such restriction, so there is no perfect division of provinces into comarcas; they are disjoint divisions made up of different municipalities. For example, the comarca of Tierra de Pinares is split between two provinces and the comarca of Cerdanya is divided between France and Spain. Both provinces and comarcas are groupings of municipalities. There are other groupings of municipalities with administrative functions defined by regional legislation including mancomunidades, metropolitan areas, juntas etc but they are not a territorial or administrative subdivision of Spain as a whole. Related to provinces, there is another territorial division of Spain into 431 judicial districts which are the constituencies for the election of provincial councils. In terms of the Separation of powers, the national government contains all three branches of government (judiciary, executive and legislative); regional governments only have executive and (unicameral) legislative branches (no judiciary). Local government is administrative only[3] and their regulations must adhere to national and regional law. In terms of relative size of each tier, in 2002, Central government accounted for 48.7% of public expenditure, Regional government for 35.5% and local government for 15.8%.[13] Decentralisation model[edit] It has been suggested that the territorial model is the most imprecise and deliberately ambiguous area of the Constitution due to unresolved controversy and political tensions when it was being negotiated.[14][15] Although Spain is considered one of the most decentralised countries in Europe, its form is not defined in the Constitution and has been the subject of much debate.[16][17][18] In the absence of an explicit definition the Constitutional Court has labeled the model the "State of Autonomous Communities", to avoid implying either a unitary or federal model.[19] Scholars have described the model as a third way between federalism and unitarianism,[20] as a federal system in all but name, or "federation without federalism",[21] as a system providing significant degree of decentralisation, though still under strict surveillance by the central government.[22] In addition to the term, "State of Autonomous Communities", various writers have sought to find terms for the Spanish model of decentralisation including "Regionalised State",[5] "Plural State", "Autonomous State", "Unitary Federal State", "Regional Unitary State", "Semi-federal, semi-regional or semi-centralized State", "Federal-regional State", "Autonomous State with federalist nuances", "Unitary State with a federalist spirit" and "Integral State".[19] A more recent assessment is[23] Among political scientists and other foreign scholars, there seems to be a consensus that the Spanish model can be regarded as a federal system with certain peculiarities... The powers that belong exclusively to the State are defined in the Constitution[24] and those of the regional governments in their statutes of autonomy and can include housing, urban and regional planning, agriculture, transport, health, education, social welfare and culture.[25] However, the Constitution provides a general framework only,[a] and there is now a large body of case-law produced by the Constitutional Court to clarify ambiguities.[2] Not all regions have the same powers so the system is termed asymmetric which is on the whole seen as advantageous, able to respond to diversity. However one aspect of this asymmetry is a cause of friction, namely that the Basque Country and Navarra can raise their own taxes and negotiate a transfer to Madrid to pay for common services and hence, unlike the other regions, do not contribute to fiscal equalisation across Spain.[27] Numerous powers are shared between national and regional governments such as the regulation of education, municipal supervision, social services and universities.[28][29] The result can be confusing.[27] With respect to local government, although the broad framework for local government is defined in the Local Government Act,[30] the details are defined by both national and regional law[31] and are mainly allocated to municipalities. In spite of the apparent prominence of provinces in the Constitution, in practice the powers of provinces and other groupings of municipalities are limited to the support for smaller municipalities[8][9][10][11][12] At least two authors describe provinces as a second tier of local government, to emphasise the function of support.[8][32] Local government political division[edit] Local government means the councils administering the multitude of "local entities", which are primarily municipalities ,[33] but also groups of municipalities including provinces, islands, metropolitan areas, comarcas, mancomunidades, metropolitan areas and sub-municipal groups known as Minor local entities (Spanish: Entidad de Ámbito Territorial Inferior al Municipio).[34][35] In practice most power is vested in municipalities; provinces and comarcas are limited to providing support for smaller municipalities.[8][9][10][11][12] The first draft of the Constitution proposed the abolition of provinces.[8] Their existence in the final version was a particularly ambiguous compromise during Constitutional negotiations whereby the older system of provinces was sought by those desirous of a unitary structure, as a means of controlling the territory from the centre, while those seeking a more federal structure wanted ter contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 62 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Political_divisions_of_Spain responseCode 3 200
