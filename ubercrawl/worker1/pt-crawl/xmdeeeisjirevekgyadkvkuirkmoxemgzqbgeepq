The agency is charged with forecasting weather, monitoring oceanic and atmospheric conditions, charting the seas, conducting deep sea exploration, and managing fishing and protection of marine mammals and endangered species in the U.S. exclusive economic zone. History[edit] Two NOAA WP-3D Orions hurricane hunter aircraft NOAA traces its history back to multiple agencies,[8] some of which were among the oldest in the federal government:[9] United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, formed in 1807 Weather Bureau of the United States, formed in 1870 Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, formed in 1871 (research fleet-only) Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps, formed in 1917 The most direct predecessor of NOAA was the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA), into which several existing scientific agencies such as the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, the Weather Bureau and the uniformed Corps were absorbed in 1965.[9] NOAA was established within the Department of Commerce via the Reorganization Plan No. 4[9] and formed on October 3, 1970, after U.S. President Richard Nixon proposed creating a new agency to serve a national need for "better protection of life and property from natural hazards… for a better understanding of the total environment… [and] for exploration and development leading to the intelligent use of our marine resources".[10] NOAA is a part of the Department of Commerce rather than the Department of Interior because of a feud between President Nixon and his interior secretary, Wally Hickel, over the Nixon Administration's Vietnam War policy. Nixon did not like Hickel's letter urging Nixon to listen to the Vietnam War demonstrators,[11] and thus punished Hickel by not putting NOAA in the Interior Department.[12] In 2007, NOAA celebrated 200 years of service in its role as successor to the U.S. Survey of the Coast.[13] NOAA was officially formed in 1970[14] and in 2021 had 11,833 civilian employees.[6] Its research and operations are further supported by 321 uniformed service members who make up the NOAA Commissioned Corps.[15] Organizational structure[edit] Silver Spring Campus[edit] NOAA's administrative headquarters has been located at the Silver Spring Metro Center office complex in downtown Silver Spring, Maryland since 1993.[16][17] The consolidated 1.2 million SF, four-building campus was originally constructed in 1993 and is home to over 40 NOAA sub-agencies and offices, including the National Weather Service. NOAA campus in Silver Spring, Maryland NOAA administrator[edit] Richard (Rick) W. Spinrad is the 11th and current Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere and NOAA Administrator. He was nominated by President Biden, and his nomination was confirmed by the US Senate on June 17, 2021, by voice vote.[18] He was sworn in on June 23, 2021.[19] From February 25, 2019, to January 20, 2021, Neil Jacobs, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Environmental Observation and Prediction, served as acting Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere at the US Department of Commerce and as NOAA's interim administrator.[20] Jacobs succeeded Timothy Gallaudet, who succeeded Benjamin Friedman. The three served in series as NOAA's interim administrator throughout the Trump Administration.[21] In October 2017, Barry Lee Myers, CEO of AccuWeather, was proposed to be the agency's administrator by the Trump Administration.[22] After two years in the nomination process, on November 21, 2019, Myers withdrew his name from consideration due to health concerns.[23] Proposal to make NOAA an Independent Agency[edit] NOAA was created by an executive order in 1970 and has never been established in law, despite its critical role. The Washington Post reported on January 27, 2023, that Congressman Frank Lucas, the new chair of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, had released draft legislation to make NOAA an independent agency, rather than it being part of the Commerce Department. Lucas' push was in response to Republican leaders who had signaled plans to slash funding for agencies and programs that continued to receive annual appropriations but had not been reauthorized by Congress. "It's been made quite clear in the Republican conference that my friends don't want to fund programs that are not properly authorized," said Lucas. "NOAA is very important, so we need to get it authorized."[24] NOAA services[edit] NOAA works toward its mission through six major line offices: the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the National Ocean Service (NOS), the National Weather Service (NWS), the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) and the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO).[25] and in addition more than a dozen staff offices, including the Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology, the NOAA Central Library, the Office of Program Planning and Integration (PPI).[25] National Weather Service[edit] The National Weather Service (NWS) is tasked with providing "weather, hydrologic and climate forecasts and warnings for the United States, its territories, adjacent waters and ocean areas, for the protection of life and property and the enhancement of the national economy", according to NOAA.[26] This is done through a collection of national and regional centers, 13 river forecast centers (RFCs), and more than 120 local weather forecast offices (WFOs).[27] They are charged with issuing weather and river forecasts, advisories, watches, and warnings on a daily basis. They issue more than 734,000 weather and 850,000 river forecasts, and more than 45,000 severe weather warnings annually. NOAA data is also relevant to the issues of climate change and ozone depletion.[28] The NWS operates NEXRAD, a nationwide network of Doppler weather radars which can detect precipitation and their velocities. Many of their products are broadcast on NOAA Weather Radio, a network of radio transmitters that broadcasts weather forecasts, severe weather statements, watches and warnings 24 hours a day.[29] National Ocean Service[edit] The National Ocean Service (NOS) focuses on ensuring that ocean and coastal areas are safe, healthy, and productive. NOS scientists, natural resource managers, and specialists serve America by ensuring safe and efficient marine transportation, promoting innovative solutions to protect coastal communities, and conserving marine and coastal places.[30][31] The National Ocean Service is composed of eight program offices: the Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services,[32] the Office for Coastal Management,[33] the National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science,[34] the Office of Coast Survey,[35] the Office of National Geodetic Survey,[36] the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries,[37] the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management,[38] and the Office of Response and Restoration.[39] There are two NOS programs, n contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 38 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/NOAA responseCode 3 200
