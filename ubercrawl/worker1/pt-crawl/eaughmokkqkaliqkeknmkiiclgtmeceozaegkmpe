Pentagon A cyclic pentagon Edges and vertices 5 In geometry, a pentagon (from the Greek πέντε pente meaning five and γωνία gonia meaning angle[1]) is any five-sided polygon or 5-gon. The sum of the internal angles in a simple pentagon is 540°. A pentagon may be simple or self-intersecting. A self-intersecting regular pentagon (or star pentagon) is called a pentagram. Regular pentagons[edit] Regular pentagon A regular pentagon Type Regular polygon Edges and vertices 5 Schläfli symbol {5} Coxeter–Dynkin diagrams Symmetry group Dihedral (D5), order 2×5 Internal angle (degrees) 108° Properties Convex, cyclic, equilateral, isogonal, isotoxal Dual polygon Self Side ( t {\displaystyle t} ), circumradius ( R {\displaystyle R} ), inscribed circle radius ( r {\displaystyle r} ), height ( R + r {\displaystyle R+r} ), width/diagonal ( φ t {\displaystyle \varphi t} ) A regular pentagon has Schläfli symbol {5} and interior angles of 108°. A regular pentagon has five lines of reflectional symmetry, and rotational symmetry of order 5 (through 72°, 144°, 216° and 288°). The diagonals of a convex regular pentagon are in the golden ratio to its sides. Given its side length t , {\displaystyle t,} its height H {\displaystyle H} (distance from one side to the opposite vertex), width W {\displaystyle W} (distance between two farthest separated points, which equals the diagonal length D {\displaystyle D} ) and circumradius R {\displaystyle R} are given by: H = 5 + 2 5 2 t ≈ 1.539 t , W = D = 1 + 5 2 t ≈ 1.618 t , W = 2 − 2 5 ⋅ H ≈ 1.051 H , R = 5 + 5 10 t ≈ 0.8507 t , D = R 5 + 5 2 = 2 R cos ⁡ 18 ∘ = 2 R cos ⁡ π 10 ≈ 1.902 R . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}H&={\frac {\sqrt {5+2{\sqrt {5}}}}{2}}~t\approx 1.539~t,\\W=D&={\frac {1+{\sqrt {5}}}{2}}~t\approx 1.618~t,\\W&={\sqrt {2-{\frac {2}{\sqrt {5}}}}}\cdot H\approx 1.051~H,\\R&={\sqrt {\frac {5+{\sqrt {5}}}{10}}}t\approx 0.8507~t,\\D&=R\ {\sqrt {\frac {5+{\sqrt {5}}}{2}}}=2R\cos 18^{\circ }=2R\cos {\frac {\pi }{10}}\approx 1.902~R.\end{aligned}}} The area of a convex regular pentagon with side length t {\displaystyle t} is given by A = t 2 25 + 10 5 4 = 5 t 2 tan ⁡ 54 ∘ 4 = 5 ( 5 + 2 5 ) t 2 4 ≈ 1.720 t 2 . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}A&={\frac {t^{2}{\sqrt {25+10{\sqrt {5}}}}}{4}}={\frac {5t^{2}\tan 54^{\circ }}{4}}\\&={\frac {{\sqrt {5(5+2{\sqrt {5}})}}\;t^{2}}{4}}\approx 1.720~t^{2}.\end{aligned}}} If the circumradius R {\displaystyle R} of a regular pentagon is given, its edge length t {\displaystyle t} is found by the expression t = R 5 − 5 2 = 2 R sin ⁡ 36 ∘ = 2 R sin ⁡ π 5 ≈ 1.176 R , {\displaystyle t=R\ {\sqrt {\frac {5-{\sqrt {5}}}{2}}}=2R\sin 36^{\circ }=2R\sin {\frac {\pi }{5}}\approx 1.176~R,} and its area is A = 5 R 2 4 5 + 5 2 ; {\displaystyle A={\frac {5R^{2}}{4}}{\sqrt {\frac {5+{\sqrt {5}}}{2}}};} since the area of the circumscribed circle is π R 2 , {\displaystyle \pi R^{2},} the regular pentagon fills approximately 0.7568 of its circumscribed circle. Derivation of the area formula[edit] The area of any regular polygon is: A = 1 2 P r {\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}Pr} where P is the perimeter of the polygon, and r is the inradius (equivalently the apothem). Substituting the regular pentagon's values for P and r gives the formula A = 1 2 ⋅ 5 t ⋅ t tan ⁡ ( 3 π 10 ) 2 = 5 t 2 tan ⁡ ( 3 π 10 ) 4 {\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}\cdot 5t\cdot {\frac {t\tan {\mathord {\left({\frac {3\pi }{10}}\right)}}}{2}}={\frac {5t^{2}\tan {\mathord {\left({\frac {3\pi }{10}}\right)}}}{4}}} with side length t. Inradius[edit] Similar to every regular convex polygon, the regular convex pentagon has an inscribed circle. The apothem, which is the radius r of the inscribed circle, of a regular pentagon is related to the side length t by r = t 2 tan ⁡ ( π 5 ) = t 2 5 − 20 ≈ 0.6882 ⋅ t . {\displaystyle r={\frac {t}{2\tan {\mathord {\left({\frac {\pi }{5}}\right)}}}}={\frac {t}{2{\sqrt {5-{\sqrt {20}}}}}}\approx 0.6882\cdot t.} Chords from the circumscribed circle to the vertices[edit] Like every regular convex polygon, the regular convex pentagon has a circumscribed circle. For a regular pentagon with successive vertices A, B, C, D, E, if P is any point on the circumcircle between points B and C, then PA + PD = PB + PC + PE. Point in plane[edit] For an arbitrary point in the plane of a regular pentagon with circumradius R {\displaystyle R} , whose distances to the centroid of the regular pentagon and its five vertices are L {\displaystyle L} and d i {\displaystyle d_{i}} respectively, we have [2] ∑ i = 1 5 d i 2 = 5 ( R 2 + L 2 ) , ∑ i = 1 5 d i 4 = 5 ( ( R 2 + L 2 ) 2 + 2 R 2 L 2 ) , ∑ i = 1 5 d i 6 = 5 ( ( R 2 + L 2 ) 3 + 6 R 2 L 2 ( R 2 + L 2 ) ) , ∑ i = 1 5 d i 8 = 5 ( ( R 2 + L 2 ) 4 + 12 R 2 L 2 ( R 2 + L 2 ) 2 + 6 R 4 L 4 ) . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\textstyle \sum _{i=1}^{5}d_{i}^{2}&=5\left(R^{2}+L^{2}\right),\\\textstyle \sum _{i=1}^{5}d_{i}^{4}&=5\left(\left(R^{2}+L^{2}\right)^{2}+2R^{2}L^{2}\right),\\\textstyle \sum _{i=1}^{5}d_{i}^{6}&=5\left(\left(R^{2}+L^{2}\right)^{3}+6R^{2}L^{2}\left(R^{2}+L^{2}\right)\right),\\\textstyle \sum _{i=1}^{5}d_{i}^{8}&=5\left(\left(R^{2}+L^{2}\right)^{4}+12R^{2}L^{2}\left(R^{2}+L^{2}\right)^{2}+6R^{4}L^{4}\right).\end{aligned}}} If d i {\displaystyle d_{i}} are the distances from the vertices of a regular pentagon to any point on its circumcircle, then [2] 3 ( ∑ i = 1 5 d i 2 ) 2 = 10 ∑ i = 1 5 d i 4 . {\displaystyle 3\left(\textstyle \sum _{i=1}^{5}d_{i}^{2}\right)^{2}=10\textstyle \sum _{i=1}^{5}d_{i}^{4}.} Geometrical constructions[edit] The regular pentagon is constructible with compass and straightedge, as 5 is a Fermat prime. A variety of methods are known for constructing a regular pentagon. Some are discussed below. Richmond's method[edit] One method to construct a regular pentagon in a given circle is described by Richmond[3] and further discussed in Cromwell's Polyhedra.[4] The top panel shows the construction used in Richmond's method to create the side of the inscribed pentagon. The circle defining the pentagon has unit radius. Its center is located at point C and a midpoint M is marked halfway along its radius. This point is joined to the periphery vertically above the center at point D. Angle CMD is bisected, and the bisector intersects the vertical axis at point Q. A horizontal line through Q intersects the circle at point P, and chord PD is the required side of the inscribed pentagon. To determine the length of this side, the two right triangles DCM and QCM are depicted below the circle. Using Pythagoras' theorem and two sides, the hypotenuse of the larger triangle is found as 5 / 2 {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\sqrt {5}}/2} . Side h of the smaller triangle then is found using the half-angle formula: tan ⁡ ( ϕ / 2 ) = 1 − cos ⁡ ( ϕ ) sin ⁡ ( ϕ ) , {\displaystyle \tan(\phi /2)={\frac {1-\cos(\phi )}{\sin(\phi )}}\ ,} where cosine and sine of ϕ are known from the larger triangle. The result is: h = 5 − 1 4 . {\displaystyle h={\frac {{\sqrt {5}}-1}{4}}\ .} If DP is truly the side of a regular pentagon, m ∠ C D P = 54 ∘ {\displaystyle m\angle \mathrm {CDP} =54^{\circ }} , so DP = 2 cos(54°), QD = DP cos(54°) = 2cos2(54°), and CQ = 1 − 2cos2(54°), which equals −cos(108°) by the cosine double angle formula. This is the cosine of 72°, which equals ( 5 − 1 ) / 4 {\displaystyle \left({\sqrt {5}}-1\right)/4} as desired. Carlyle circles[edit] Main article: Carlyle circle Method using Carlyle circles The Carlyle circle was invented as a geometric method to find the roots of a quadratic equation.[5] This methodology leads to a procedure for constructing a regular pentagon. The steps are as follows:[6] Draw a circle in which to inscribe the pentagon and mark the center point O. Draw a horizontal line through the center of the circle. Mark the left intersection with the circle as point B. Construct a vertical line through the center. Mark one intersection with the circle as point A. Construct the point M as the midpoint of O and B. Draw a circle centered at M through the point A. Mark its intersection with the horizontal line (inside the original circle) as the point W and its intersection outside the circle as the point V. Draw a circle of radius OA and center W. It intersects the original circle at two of the vertices of the pentagon. Draw a circle of radius OA and center V. It intersects the original circle at two of the vertices of the pentagon. The fifth vertex is the rightmost intersection of the horizontal line with the original circle. Steps 6–8 are equivalent to the following version, shown in the animation: 6a. Construct point F as the midpoint of O and W. 7a. Construct a vertical line through F. It intersects the original circle at two of the vertices of the pentagon. The third vertex is the rightmost intersection of the horizontal line with the original circle. 8a. Construct the other two vertices using the compass and the length of the vertex found in step 7a. Euclid's method[edit] Euclid's method for pentagon at a given circle, using the golden triangle, animation 1 min 39 s A regular pentagon is constructible using a compass and straightedge, either by inscribing one in a given circle or constructing one on a given edge. This process was described by Euclid in his Elements circa 300 BC.[7][8] Physical construction methods[edit] Overhand knot of a paper strip A regular pentagon may be created from just a strip of paper by tying an overhand knot into the strip and carefully flattening the knot by pulling the ends of the paper strip. Folding one of the ends back over the pentagon will reveal a pentagram when backlit. Construct a regular hexagon on stiff paper or card. Crease along the three diameters between opposite vertices. Cut from one vertex to the center to make an equilateral triangular flap. Fix this flap underneath its neig contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 42 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Pentagon responseCode 3 200
