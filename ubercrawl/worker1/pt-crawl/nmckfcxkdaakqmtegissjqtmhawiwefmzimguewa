The armed wing was formed by the NUG from youths and pro-democracy activists on 5 May 2021 in response to the coup d'état that occurred on 1 February 2021 that put the military junta and their armed wing the Tatmadaw in power.[21] The military junta designated it as a terrorist organisation on 8 May 2021.[22] In October 2021, NUG's Ministry of Defence announced that it had formed a central committee to coordinate military operations across the country.[23] According to the NUG statement, the PDF is divided into five regional commands (Northern, Southern, Central, Eastern and Western commands[24]), each mounting at least three brigades. Each brigade consists of five battalions, which divide into four companies.[25] On 13 July 2021, NUG's minister of defence Yee Mon stated that the strength of the newly-formed militia was expected to reach 8,000 by the end of the month.[26] Estimates by The Irrawaddy put the PDF's numbers at 65,000 in November 2022.[27] The PDF's leadership believe in the usage of guerrilla warfare tactics to achieve their aims.[28] History[edit] See also: Myanmar civil war (2021–present) Minister of Defence Yee Mon announced on 16 April 2021 that NUG would establish an armed wing that would cooperate with various ethnic armed organisations[29] to launch an armed revolution against the junta.[30] On 5 May 2021, NUG announced the formation of the PDF as a "forerunner of the federal armed forces". It also stated that the PDF was formed in response to the violence happening throughout the country.[31] On 28 May 2021, NUG released a video of the PDF's graduation ceremony, announcing that the armed wing was ready to challenge the junta's forces.[32] On 7 September 2021, the NUG announced the launch of the "People's Defensive War" against the military junta, and urged the citizens to revolt against the junta in every corner of the country.[33] On 7 September 2022, NUG acting president Duwa Lashi La gave a speech on the one-year anniversary of the defensive war. He stated that the PDF suffered from 1,500 casualties within one year after the declaration, and that the junta was losing their territorial control.[34] The NUG also stated that 2023 would be an important year as they would "successfully end the revolution in that year and six battlefronts would be opened to do so".[35] Starting from 2023, local PDFs have been reportedly planning to perform coordinated attacks against the regime as a "Phase 2 of the NUG's one year plan".[36] On 5 May 2023, the NUG stated that around 300 battalions and columns have been established nationwide, as well as local PDFs in 250 townships. Duwa Lashi La also stated that the combating strength of the PDF is "now greater than that of the regime", and the PDF soldiers need equipment to defend against the regime's airstrike attacks.[37] On 1 June 2023, the NUG announced the formation of the 5101st Battalion, the first military battalion based in Yangon Region.[38] Yangon Region clashes[edit] On 14 August 2021, the PDF ambushed six heavily armed policemen who were travelling along the Yangon Circular Railway. Five were killed. A sixth was injured but survived. Four automatic rifles were seized.[39] Shan State clashes[edit] The PDF clashed with the Tatmadaw in Muse on 23 May 2021, killing at least 13 members of Myanmar's security forces.[40] Another clash happened in the town of Moebyel, in which 20 members of the police force were killed.[41] Chin State clashes[edit] Main article: Chinland Defense Force Chin State saw some of the earliest armed resistance. Clashes were reported initially in late March 2021. Armed with traditional tumi guns, ethnic Chin inflicted casualties on the Tatmadaw. In early April 2021, Chinland Defense Force (CDF) was established. Tatmadaw saw heavy casualties in clashes with Mindat branch of the CDF in late April and May 2021. CDF Mindat briefly occupied the town, but was forced to withdraw when the Tatmadaw used civilians as shields.[42][43] Chin National Army, the existing Chin armed organisation, various township branches of the CDF and Chin National Defence Force (an armed Chin organization formed after the coup) came together to form a joint defence coordination body called Chinland Joint Defense Committee (CJDC).[44] The total strength of active personnel under the command of CJDC was approximated to be around 13,000. From August to October 2021, it was reported that at least 40 clashes occurred between junta troops and CDF.[45] CJDC claimed that at least 1,029 Tatmadaw soldiers were killed in the clashes and lost 58 of their own in 2021.[46] Karenni State clashes[edit] Karenni PDF launched attacks in Demoso and Bawlakhe townships, killing at least twenty Tatmadaw soldiers and police and burning down three outposts on 26 May 2021.[5] Tatmadaw retaliated by shelling residential areas.[47] On 31 May 2021, Karenni Nationalities Defence Force (KNDF) was formed as a merger of scattered PDF groups in the Karenni state and some local Ethnic Armed Organisations. The main organisation was Karenni National Progressive Party.[48] Sagaing clashes[edit] The PDF, along with the Kachin Independence Army, began assaults on Tatmadaw positions in Katha, Sagaing around the end of May 2021, killing eight regime soldiers and injuring thirteen.[49] On 24 and 26 June 2021, combined PDF and KIA forces clashed with the Tatmadaw, reportedly killing at least 44 regime troops.[50] On 15 January 2022, a combined force of PDF and All Burma Students' Democratic Front attacked two Tatmadaw ships approaching Katha from Shwegu using rocket-propelled grenades. This confrontation marks the first time ABSDF had engaged the Tatmadaw since the beginning of the coup, entering a war against the regime and openly siding with the PDF.[51] On 1 February 2023, a local PDF shot down a Tatmadaw Mi-17 helicopter during a clash in Shwepyiaye, Homalin Township.[52] On 8 and 9 February, a coalition of local PDFs, under the leadership of the NUG's defence ministry, launched an attack on "15 military targets in the region", killing 44 and injuring 8 regime troops. During the attack, 2 PDF soldiers were killed and 13 were injured.[53] On 19 March 2023, the Chindwin Attack Force shelled the headquarters of the Northwestern Command in Monywa, as the junta leader Min Aung Hlaing was reportedly visiting there. Five out of eight mortar shells exploded on the checkpoint gates, and the regime troops are said to have retaliated with chemical bombs.[54][55] On 3 November 2023, the PDF and the KIA launched an offensive in Kawlin. The offensive took four days, ending with the defending junta troops surrendering with the white flag. On 6 November, the NUG announced that they were able to seize the town and posted a photo of the PDF flag being flown at the Kawlin District Administration Department. This is the first district-level town that the PDF was able to take over.[56][57] Mandalay clashes[edit] In early June 2021, PDF activities increased significantly across the Mandalay District, with multiple violent clashes with pro-junta security forces reported in Mandalay City and surrounding townships. On 1 June, a PDF fighter shot two soldiers, killing one, outside of a high school that had been forced to re-open by junta authorities despite a nationwide boycott of government-run schools. The leader of the PDF in Mandalay, Bo Nat Khat, also claimed responsibility for recent bombings in five townships. The military junta called the PDF attacks acts of terrorism.[58] In Patheingyi Township on 8 June, three PDF fighters in a vehicle rammed two police officers on motorbikes before shooting and killing them. The PDF claimed responsibility for the attack, which was confirmed by a pro-democracy police officer.[58] On 22 June, Tatmadaw forces in armoured vehicles raided a PDF base in Chanmyathazi Township, res contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 68 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/People%27s_Defence_Force_(Myanmar) responseCode 3 200
