The use of tamoxifen is recommended for 10 years.[27] In 2006, the large STAR clinical study concluded that raloxifene is also effective in reducing the incidence of breast cancer. Updated results after an average of 6.75 years of follow up found that raloxifene retains 76% of tamoxifen's effectiveness in preventing invasive breast cancer, with 45% fewer uterine cancers and 25% fewer blood clots in women taking raloxifene than in women taking tamoxifen.[28][29][30] Infertility[edit] Tamoxifen is used for ovulation induction to treat infertility in women with anovulatory disorders. It is given at days three to seven of a woman's cycle.[31] Tamoxifen improves fertility in males with infertility by disinhibiting the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis) via ER antagonism and thereby increasing the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and increasing testicular testosterone production.[32] Gynecomastia[edit] Tamoxifen is used to prevent and treat gynecomastia.[33][34] It is taken as a preventative measure in small doses, or used at the onset of any symptoms such as nipple soreness or sensitivity. Other medications are taken for similar purposes such as clomifene and the anti-aromatase drugs which are used in order to try to avoid the hormone-related adverse effects. v t e Tamoxifen doses and rates of bicalutamide-induced breast symptoms in men Follow-up timepoint Tamoxifen dosage Placebo 1 mg/day 2.5 mg/day 5 mg/day 10 mg/day 20 mg/day 0 months – 6 months 98% 90% 80% 54% 22% 10% 12 months 99% 95% 84% 56% 38% 19% Notes: Prevention of breast symptoms—specifically gynecomastia and breast pain—induced by 150 mg/day bicalutamide monotherapy with tamoxifen in 282 men with prostate cancer. Bicalutamide and tamoxifen were initiated at the same time (0 months). Estradiol levels were in the range of about 22 to 47 pg/mL in the treated group.[35] Sources: [36][35] Early puberty[edit] Tamoxifen is useful in the treatment of peripheral precocious puberty, for instance due to McCune–Albright syndrome, in both girls and boys.[37][38][39] It has been found to decrease growth velocity and the rate of bone maturation in girls with precocious puberty, and hence to improve final height in these individuals.[37][38] Available forms[edit] Nolvadex (tamoxifen) 20 mg tablets. Tamoxifen is available as a tablet or oral solution.[40][41] Contraindications[edit] Tamoxifen has a number of contraindications, including known hypersensitivity to tamoxifen or other ingredients, individuals taking concomitant coumarin-type anticoagulant therapy, and women with a history of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).[12] Side effects[edit] A report in September 2009 from Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality suggests that tamoxifen, raloxifene, and tibolone used to treat breast cancer significantly reduce invasive breast cancer in midlife and older women, but also increase the risk of adverse side effects.[42] Endometrial cancer[edit] Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM).[43] Even though it is an antagonist in breast tissue it acts as partial agonist on the endometrium and has been linked to endometrial cancer in some women. Therefore, endometrial changes, including cancer, are among tamoxifen's side effects.[44] With time, risk of endometrial cancer may be doubled to quadrupled, which is a reason tamoxifen is typically only used for five years.[45] The American Cancer Society lists tamoxifen as a known carcinogen, stating that it increases the risk of some types of uterine cancer while lowering the risk of breast cancer recurrence.[46] Cardiovascular and metabolic[edit] Tamoxifen treatment of postmenopausal women is associated with beneficial effects on serum lipid profiles. However, long-term data from clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a cardioprotective effect.[47] For some women, tamoxifen can cause a rapid increase in triglyceride concentration in the blood. In addition, there is an increased risk of thromboembolism especially during and immediately after major surgery or periods of immobility.[48] Use of tamoxifen has been shown to slightly increase risk of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke.[49] Liver toxicity[edit] Tamoxifen has been associated with a number of cases of hepatotoxicity.[50] Several different varieties of hepatotoxicity have been reported.[50] Tamoxifen can also precipitate non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in obese and overweight women (not in normal weight women) at an average rate of 40% after a year use with 20 mg/day.[51] Overdose[edit] Acute overdose of tamoxifen has not been reported in humans.[12] In dose-ranging studies, tamoxifen was administered at very high doses in women (e.g., 300 mg/m2) and was found to produce acute neurotoxicity including tremor, hyperreflexia, unsteady gait, and dizziness.[12] These symptoms occurred within three to five days of therapy and disappeared within two to five days of discontinuation of therapy.[12] No indications of permanent neurotoxicity were observed.[12] QT prolongation was also observed with very high doses of tamoxifen.[12] There is no specific antidote for overdose of tamoxifen.[12] Instead, treatment should be based on symptoms.[12] Interactions[edit] Patients with variant forms of the gene CYP2D6 may not receive full benefit from tamoxifen because of too slow metabolism of the tamoxifen prodrug into its active metabolites.[52][53] On 18 October 2006, the Subcommittee for Clinical Pharmacology recommended relabeling tamoxifen to include information about this gene in the package insert.[54] Certain CYP2D6 variations in breast cancer patients lead to a worse clinical outcome for tamoxifen treatment.[55] Genotyping therefore has the potential for identification of women who have these CYP2D6 phenotypes and for whom the use of tamoxifen is associated with poor outcomes. Recent research has shown that 7–10% of women with breast cancer may not receive the full medical benefit from taking tamoxifen due to their genetic make-up.
