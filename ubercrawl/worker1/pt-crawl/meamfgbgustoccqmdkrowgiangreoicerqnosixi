The General Secretary of Türksoy is Sultan Raev, the former Minister of Culture of Kyrgyzstan and deputy General Secretary of Organization of Turkic States. Türksoy has its headquarters in Ankara, Turkey. Name[edit] TÜRKSOY was initially established as the Common Administration of Turkic Culture and Arts (Turkish: Türk Kültür ve Sanatları Ortak Yönetimi), and was later on renamed as International Organization of Turkic Culture. Its acronym nevertheless remained the same.[1] History[edit] The organization has its roots in meetings during 1992 in Baku and Istanbul, where the ministers of culture from Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkey, and Turkmenistan declared their commitment to cooperate in a joint cultural framework. Türksoy was subsequently established by an agreement signed on 12 July 1993 in Almaty. In 1996, an official cooperation between Türksoy and UNESCO was established, involving mutual consultations and reciprocal representation.[4] Since its establishment, the Turkic Council has acted as an umbrella organization for Türksoy and a number of related organizations.[5] Member and observer states[edit] As of 2022, Türksoy has six founding and 8 observer members.[2] Türksoy Headquarters, Ankara Members[edit] Member state Official language(s) Accession date Area (km²) Demographics Azerbaijan[6] Azerbaijani[6] 1993[6] 86,600[6] 91% Azerbaijanis, 3% Lezgins, 2% Russians, 1,5% Armenians, and others[6] Kazakhstan[7] Kazakh, Russian[7] 1993[7] 2,724,900[7] 64% Kazakhs, 24% Russians, and others[7] Kyrgyzstan[8] Kyrgyz, Russian[8] 1993[8] 199,951[8] 77% Kyrgyz, 15% Uzbeks, 5% Russians, and others[8] Turkey[9] Turkish[9] 1993[9] 783,562[9] 70–75% Turks, 19% Kurds and 6–11% others[9] Turkmenistan[10] Turkmen[10] 1993[10] 488,100[10] 85% Turkmens, 5% Uzbeks, 4% Russians, and others[10] Uzbekistan[11] Uzbek[11] 1993[11] 448,924[11] 80% Uzbeks, 5% Russians, 5% Tajiks, and others[11] Observers[edit] Observer state Official language(s) Accession date Area (km²) Demographics Bashkortostan (Russian Federation)[12] Bashkir, Russian[12] 1993[12] 143,600[12] 29% Bashkirs, 36% Russians, 24% Tatars, and others[12] Northern Cyprus (de facto)[13] Turkish[13] 1993[13] 3,335[13] 98% Turks, 0,5% Greeks, and others[13] Tatarstan (Russian Federation)[14] Tatar, Russian[14] 1993[14] 67,836[14] 52% Tatars, 39% Russians, and others[14] Khakassia (Russian Federation)[15] Khakas, Russian[15] 1996[15] 61,900[15] 13% Khakas, 79% Russians, and others[15] Tuva (Russian Federation)[16] Tuvan, Russian[16] 1996[16] 170,500[16] 64% Tuvans, 32% Russians, and others[16] Găgăuzia (Moldova)[17] Gagauz, Romanian, Russian[17] 1999[17] 1,832[17] 82% Gagauz, 7,8% Moldovans, 4,9% Bulgarians, and others[17] Altai (Russian Federation)[18] Altay, Russian[18] 2003[18] 206,168[18] 31% Altaians, 61,4% Russians, Kazakhs and others[18] Yakutia (Russian Federation)[19] Yakut, Russian[19] 2003[19] 3,062,100[19] 40% Yakuts, 60% Russians, Tatars and others[19] Activities[edit] Since its establishment, Türksoy has been "carrying out activities to strengthen the ties of brotherhood and solidarity among Turkic peoples, transmit the common Turkic culture to future generations and introduce it to the world."[20] Activities and events include: Gatherings of artists, photographers, painters, opera singers, poets, journalists, theatre, dance and music ensembles of the Turkic World Monthly journal published in three languages Publishing works written in various Turkic languages and dialects Commemoration of artists, authors, poets and scholars in recognition of their valuable contribution to Turkic culture Symposia and conferences covering topics on the common history, language, culture and art of Turkic peoples Nevruz Day celebrations including concerts and events held in the UNESCO Headquarters in 2010, the United Nations General Assembly Hall in 2011, and various other countries including Germany, Austria, and the United Kingdom.[21] Cultural Capital of the Turkic World[edit] Main article: Culture and Arts Capital of the Turkic World Every year, Türksoy selects one city in the Turkic world to be the "Cultural Capital of the Turkic World".
