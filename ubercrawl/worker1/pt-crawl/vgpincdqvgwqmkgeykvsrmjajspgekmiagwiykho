The players on this composite team are selected from a chain of fifteen Caribbean nation-states and territories. As of 26 November 2022[update], the West Indies cricket team is ranked eighth in Tests, and tenth in ODIs and seventh in T20Is in the official ICC rankings.[11] From the mid-late 1970s to the early 1990s, the West Indies team was the strongest in the world in both Test and One Day International cricket. A number of cricketers who were considered among the best in the world have hailed from the West Indies: Garfield Sobers, Lance Gibbs, George Headley, Brian Lara, Vivian Richards, Clive Lloyd, Malcolm Marshall, Alvin Kallicharran, Andy Roberts, Rohan Kanhai, Frank Worrell, Gordon Greenidge, Clyde Walcott, Everton Weekes, Curtly Ambrose, Desmond Haynes, Michael Holding, Courtney Walsh, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Joel Garner and Wes Hall have all been inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.[12][13] The West Indies have won the ICC Cricket World Cup twice (1975 and 1979, when it was styled the Prudential Cup), the ICC T20 World Cup twice (2012 and 2016, when it was styled World Twenty20), the ICC Champions Trophy once (2004), the ICC Under 19 Cricket World Cup once (2016), and have also finished as runners-up in the Cricket World Cup (1983), the Under 19 Cricket World Cup (2004), and the ICC Champions Trophy (2006). The West Indies appeared in three consecutive World Cup finals (1975, 1979 and 1983), and were the first team to win back-to-back World Cups (1975 and 1979), both of these records have been surpassed only by Australia, who appeared in 4 consecutive World Cup Finals (1996, 1999, 2003 and 2007) winning 3 consecutive World Cups (1999, 2003 and 2007). The West Indies have hosted the 2007 Cricket World Cup and the 2010 ICC World Twenty20.

Affiliates in Cricket West Indies[edit] Map of Cricket West Indies' members and affiliates. Full members are in bold, sub-members are in normal text, and affiliates in italics. Cricket West Indies, the governing body of the team, consists of the six cricket associations of Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, the Leeward Islands, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Windward Islands. The Leeward Islands Cricket Association consists of three cricket associations from two sovereign states (one from Antigua and Barbuda, and two from Saint Kitts and Nevis), three British Overseas Territories (Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, and Montserrat), one U.S. territory (the U.S. Virgin Islands), and one Dutch constituent country (Sint Maarten). The Windward Islands Cricket Board of Control consists of associations of four sovereign states (Dominica, Grenada, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines). Two more British Overseas Territories in the region that have once been historical parts of the former West Indies Federation, the Cayman Islands and the Turks and Caicos Islands, have their own national teams currently. National teams also exist for the various islands, which, as they are all separate countries, very much keep their local identities and support their local favourites. These national teams take part in the West Indian first-class competition, the Regional Four Day Competition (earlier known as the Busta Cup, Shell Shield, Carib Beer Cup, and various other names).[15] It is also common for other international teams to play the island teams for warm-up games before they take on the combined West Indies team. The combined population of these countries and territories is around 6 million people, comparable to fellow Full Members New Zealand and Ireland, and prominent Associate Member Scotland. The member associations of Cricket West Indies are: Barbados Cricket Association (BCA) Guyana Cricket Board (GCB) Jamaica Cricket Association (JCA) Leeward Islands Cricket Association (LICA); itself composed of: Anguilla Cricket Association Antigua and Barbuda Cricket Association British Virgin Islands Cricket Association Montserrat Cricket Association Nevis Cricket Association (for the island of Nevis alone) Saint Kitts Cricket Association (for the island of Saint Kitts alone) Sint Maarten Cricket Association United States Virgin Islands Cricket Association Trinidad and Tobago Cricket Board (TTCB) Windward Islands Cricket Board of Control (WICBC); itself composed of: Dominica Cricket Association Grenada Cricket Association Saint Lucia Cricket Association Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Cricket Association Potential future members[edit] Bahamas Overseas collectivities of France Saint BarthélemyL Saint MartinL Overseas regions of the French Republic GuadeloupeL MartiniqueW Special municipalities of the Netherlands SabaL Sint EustatiusL Legends L = Affiliate of the Leeward Islands Cricket Association W = Affiliate of the Windward Islands Cricket Board of Control History[edit] Main article: History of the West Indian cricket team Learie Constantine, who played Test cricket in the 1920s and 1930s, was one of the first great West Indian players. Daren Sammy. The West Indies have won three major tournament titles: the Champions Trophy once, and the World Twenty20 twice. Both World T20s were won with Sammy as captain, making him the only West Indian captain besides Clive Lloyd with multiple ICC tournament victories. The history of the West Indies cricket team began in the 1890s, when the first representative sides were selected to play visiting English sides. The WICB joined the sport's international ruling body, the Imperial Cricket Conference, in 1926,[16] and played their first official international match, granted Test status, in 1928,[17] thus becoming the fourth Test 'nation'. In their early days in the 1930s, the side represented the British colonies that would later form the West Indies Federation plus British Guiana. The last series the West Indies played before the outbreak of the Second World War was against England in 1939. There followed a hiatus that lasted until January 1948 when the MCC toured the West Indies.[18] Of the West Indies players in that first match after the war only Gerry Gomez, George Headley, Jeffrey Stollmeyer, and Foffie Williams had previously played Test cricket.[19] In 1948, leg spinner Wilfred Ferguson became the first West Indian bowler to take ten wickets in a Test, finishing with 11/229 in a match against England;[20] later that same year Hines Johnson became the first West Indies fast bowler to achieve the feat, managing 10/96 against the same opponents.[21] The West Indies defeated England for the first time at Lord's on 29 June 1950. Ramadhin and Alf Valentine were the architects of the victory which inspired a calypso by Lord Beginner. Later on 16 August 1950, completed a 3–1 series win when they won at The Oval. Although blessed with some great players in their early days as a Test team, their successes remained sporadic until the 1960s when the side changed from a white-dominated to a black-dominated side under the successive captaincies of Frank Worrell and Gary Sobers. The team won the inaugural World Cup in England in 1975, and retained the title in 1979.[22] By the late 1970s, the West Indies led by Clive Lloyd had a side recognised as unofficial world champions, a reputatio contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 58 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team responseCode 3 200
