Below is the revised version that I would like to implement. This would involve several changes to structure, and also to content, such as; simplifying the titles for each group within the nav box, consolidating some sections renaming some links to be more clear, adding a new line to link to the Library adding a line to link to some of the basic newsletters, and also to some resources for data relating to Wikipedia regrouping links within some groups on separate lines, to make this easier for newcomers. the goal is to make this nav box simpler for new editors, as well as easier to read for existing editors. v t e Proposed changes for Template:Basic information Help directory menu Basics Basic information category About Wikipedia Why create an account?

If no one has any comments or objections then I hope to make these changes within the next day or so. --Sm8900 (talk) 12:01, 3 March 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] is it ok to set up archiving for this page?[edit] is it ok to set up archiving for this talk page? can I insert the code below to do so? I will wait to allow any comments. this would archive any discussions after 60 days since the last comment. {{User:MiszaBot/config
 | algo                = old(60d)
 | archive             = User talk:Example/ArchiveÂ %(counter)d
 | counter             = 1
 | maxarchivesize      = 150K
 | archiveheader       = {{Automatic archive navigator}}
 | minthreadstoarchive = 1
 | minthreadsleft      = 4
}}
 thanks. --Sm8900 (talk) 15:26, 20 May 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] First question: there are only three threads so far, so why do you want them archived? Second question: what does User talk:Example have to do with this page, and why do you think a subpage of that would be a good place to put archived threads from this page? --Redrose64 ðŸŒ¹ (talk) 08:51, 21 May 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] my comments above was in error, in omitting to replace the hypothetical sample page name above, with the actual correct name of this page. thanks for catching that. as far as why we should have an archive; i would be willing to make the time period longer for archiving a thread, eg a year or more; however it seems to me that at some point, any talk page for a resource page, like this one, should have some finite time period ,after which a thread would eventually be archived. --Sm8900 (talk) 18:08, 23 May 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] This page is a long way from needing to be archived, both in terms of time and number of threads. --Redrose64 ðŸŒ¹ (talk) 13:35, 24 May 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] Proposal to modify template[edit] hi. there is a proposal to modify this template, at the page below.
