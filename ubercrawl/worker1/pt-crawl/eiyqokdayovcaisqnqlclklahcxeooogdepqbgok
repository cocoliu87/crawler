The matches were played as One Day Internationals (ODIs) with Pakistan as the official host and Sri-Lanka as the co-host for select matches involving India.[2][3][4][5] It was held in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, between 30 August to 17 September 2023.[6][7] The tournament was contested by 6 teams.[8] Sri Lanka were the defending champions.[9] It was the first Asia Cup to be held in multiple countries, with four matches being played in Pakistan and the remaining nine matches being played in Sri Lanka.[10][11][3] The five full members of the Asian Cricket Council were part of the tournament: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. They were joined by Nepal, who qualified by winning the 2023 ACC Men's Premier Cup. For the first time, the tournament was held in a "hybrid format" with the games organised in two countries. All teams played at least a few games in Pakistan, except for India, who refused to travel to Pakistan due to disapproval from the Indian government.[12][13][14] In January 2023, the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) announced the pathway structure and calendar for 2023 and 2024,[15][16] where they confirmed the dates and format of the tournament.[17] Originally, the tournament was scheduled to take place in 2021, but was postponed to 2023 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The fixtures for the tournament were announced on 19 July 2023.[18] India defeated Sri Lanka by 10 wickets in the final to win their eighth Asia Cup title. Background In June 2020, following a meeting with the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said they would be willing to let Sri Lanka host the 2020 Asia Cup,[19] with India unwilling to travel to Pakistan.[20] The ACC issued a press release following the meeting stating that "in light of the impact and consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, possible venue options for the Asia Cup 2020 were discussed and it was decided to take the final decision in due course".[21] In July 2020, an official announcement of the postponement was made by the ACC.[22] The 2020 edition was rescheduled to take place in Sri Lanka in June 2021.[23] In March 2021, the tournament was at risk of a further postponement after India qualified for the final of the World Test Championship, which clashed with the proposed dates in June.[24] The tournament was postponed once again to 2023.[25] In May 2021, the ACC announced that the 2021 tournament would be deferred to 2023, citing that it would be difficult to schedule the tournament due to the continued impact of COVID-19 on the scheduling of other cricket events.[26][27] Pakistan was scheduled to host the 2022 Asia Cup after retaining the rights to host the 2022 edition.[28] However, in October 2021, following a meeting with the ACC, Ramiz Raja confirmed that Pakistan would host the tournament in 2023, with Sri Lanka hosting the 2022 edition.[29] In October 2022, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary and ACC President Jay Shah announced that India would not travel to Pakistan, citing security concerns, and that the Asia Cup 2023 would take place in a neutral venue. [30] In December 2022, the then PCB chairman Ramiz Raja said that Pakistan might consider pulling out of the tournament if their hosting rights were withdrawn because of India's unwillingness to travel to Pakistan.[31] However, in January 2023, ACC confirmed the teams and groups of the tournament, with both India and Pakistan taking part.[32] The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) had threatened to boycott the 2023 Cricket World Cup if the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) refused to send a team to the 2023 Asia Cup scheduled in Pakistan.[33][34] In March 2023, it was proposed that Pakistan remain as hosts and that all India matches - including at least two India-Pakistan contests - would be played at a neutral venue yet to be confirmed.[35] The hybrid model proposed by Pakistan was rejected by Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.[36] In response, PCB Chairman Najam Sethi proposed two options. The first option was that India play all their matches at a neutral venue with Pakistan hosting the rest of the teams. The second option was that four matches in the group stage take place in Pakistan whereas the second phase, in which matches played by the Indian team followed by the next stage matches including the final, be played at a neutral venue. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh agreed to the second option.[37] On 15 June 2023, the Asian Cricket Council announced that the tournament would be organized in a hybrid model with four matches being held in Pakistan, and the remaining nine in Sri Lanka.[38] Format The groups and format of the tournament were announced on 9 January 2023, with the six teams split into two groups of three.[39] A total of 13 matches will be played, which includes six league matches, six Super 4 matches, and a final.[40] India, Pakistan and Nepal, champions of the qualifier event (2023 ACC Men's Premier Cup), were placed in Group A, while the defending champions Sri Lanka was grouped with Bangladesh and Afghanistan in Group B.[41] The top two teams from each of the groups will progress to the Super 4. From there, the top two teams will play each other in the final.[42] Pakistan and India were seeded as A1 & A2, and Bangladesh and Sri Lanka were seeded as B2 & B1. In case Nepal and Afghanistan qualify for the Super Four stage, they will take the slot of the team knocked out (Pakistan or India in Group A and Sri Lanka or Bangladesh in Group B).[13] [43] Teams and qualification Qualified for Asia Cup as full members Qualified through 2023 ACC Men's Premier Cup Failed to qualify The five full members of the Asian Cricket Council qualified automatically for the tournament while Nepal qualified for the main tournament for the first time through 2023 ACC Men's Premier Cup, was held in April/May 2023 in Nepal, defeating UAE in the final.[44] Means of qualification Date Host Berths Qualified ICC Full Member — None 5 Afghanistan Bangladesh India Pakistan Sri Lanka 2023 ACC Men's Premier Cup 18 April — 2 May 2023 Nepal 1 Nepal Squads Afghanistan[45] Bangladesh[46] India[47] Nepal[48] Pakistan[49] Sri Lanka[50] Hashmatullah Shahidi (c) Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk) Ibrahim Zadran Riaz Hassan Rahmat Shah Najibullah Zadran Mohammad Nabi Ikram Alikhil (wk) Rashid Khan Gulbadin Naib Karim Janat Abdul Rahman Sharafuddin Ashraf Mujeeb Ur Rahman Noor Ahmad Mohammad Saleem Fazalhaq Farooqi Shakib Al Hasan (c) Litton Das (vc) Anamul Haque Tanzid Hasan Najmul Hossain Shanto Towhid Hridoy Mushfiqur Rahim (wk) Mehidy Hasan Taskin Ahmed Mustafizur Rahman Hasan Mahmud Mohammad Naim Mahedi Hasan Nasum Ahmed Shamim Hossain Ebadot Hossain Afif Hossain Shoriful Islam Tanzim Hasan Sakib Rohit Sharma (c) Hardik Pandya (vc) Jasprit Bumrah Shubman Gill Shreyas Iyer Ravindra Jadeja Ishan Kishan (wk) Prasidh Krishna Virat Kohli Axar Patel KL Rahul (wk) Mohammed Shami Mohammed Siraj Washington Sundar Shardul Thakur Tilak Varma Kuldeep Yadav Suryakumar Yadav Rohit Paudel (c) Aasif Sheikh (wk) Dipendra Singh Airee Kushal Bhurtel Mousom Dhakal Pratis GC Gulsan Jha Sundeep Jora Karan KC Sompal Kami Sandeep Lamichhane Kishor Mahato Kushal Malla Lalit Rajbanshi Aarif Sheikh Arjun Saud (wk) Bhim Sharki Babar Azam (c) Shadab Khan (vc) Salman Ali Agha Shaheen Afridi Iftikhar Ahmed Faheem Ashraf Imam-ul-Haq Mohammad Haris Zaman Khan Mohammad Nawaz Usama Mir Haris Rauf Mohammad Rizwan (wk) Abdullah Shafique Saud Shakeel Naseem Shah Mohammad Wasim Fakhar Zaman Dasun Shanaka (c) Kusal Mendis (vc, wk) Pathum Nissanka Dimuth Karunaratne Kusal Perera Sahan Arachchige Charith Asalanka Dhananjaya de Silva Sadeera Samarawickrama Maheesh Theekshana Dunith Wellalage Matheesha Pathirana Kasun Rajitha Dushan Hemantha Binura Fernando Pramod Madushan Ahead of the tournament, Ebadot Hossain was ruled out of Bangladesh's squad due to an injury and was replaced by Tanzim Hasan Sakib.[51] Saud Shakeel was added to Pakistan's squad, with Tayyab Tahir moved into the reserves.[52] Sanju Samson was added to India's squad as reserves.[53] Initially, on 30 August 2023, Liton Das was ruled out from Bangladesh's squad for the entire tournament with a viral fever, with Anamul Haque named as his replacement.[54] However after missing out Bangladesh's initial two matches, Das joined the squad after he was declared fit on 2 September 2023.[55] On 5 September 2023, Najmul Hossain Shanto was ruled out of Bangladesh squad for rest of the tournament after he sustained a hamstring injury during their Group Stage match against Afghanistan.[56] On 13 September Naseem Shah was ruled out of Pakistan squad for rest of the tournament after he sustained a shoulder injury during their Super Four match against India.[57] On 16 September Axar Patel was ruled out of India squad for the Asia Cup Final after he sustained multiple injuries during their Super Four match against Bangladesh, he was replaced by Washington Sundar[58] Ahead of the final, Maheesh Theekshana was ruled out of Sri Lanka's squad due to sustaining hamstring injury and was replaced by Sahan Arachchige.[59] Venues Pakistan Sri Lanka Lahore Multan Colombo Kandy Gaddafi Stadium Multan Cricket Stadium R.
