Their life cycle includes an egg stage found in host feces, a cystacanth (larval) stage in an intermediate host such as termites, and an adult stage where cystacanths mature in the intestines of the host. This genus is characterized by a cylindrical proboscis with a crown of robust hooks at the apex followed by numerous small hooks on the rest of the proboscis, a long body with pseudosegmentation, filiform lemnisci, and ellipsoid testes. The largest known specimen is the female G. ortizi with a length of around 240 millimetres (9.4 in) and a width of 2 millimetres (0.08 in). Genetic analysis on one species of Gigantorhynchus places it with the related genus Mediorhynchus in the family Gigantorhynchidae. Six species in this genus are distributed across Central and South America and possibly Zimbabwe. Infestation by a Gigantorhynchus species may cause partial obstructions of the intestines, severe lesions of the intestinal wall, and may lead to death. Taxonomy[edit] The name Gigantorhynchus is derived from two Ancient Greek words: gígantas, which Otto Hamann used in 1892 as a descriptor for the family and genus when grouping the larger varieties of these worms,[a] and rhúnkhos, meaning snout, nose, or beak, which describes the characteristic proboscis in this genus of Acanthocephala.[1] Phylogenetic analysis has been conducted on only one of the six species in the genus, G. echinodiscus, using the gene for 28S ribosomal RNA and confirms that this species forms a monophyletic group with the related genus Mediorhynchus in the family Gigantorhynchidae.[2] The type species is G. echinodiscus.[3] Archiacanthocephala Archiacanthocephala Oligacanthorhynchidae Macracanthorhynchus ingens Oncicola venezuelensis Oligacanthorhynchus tortuosa Nephridiacanthus major Moniliformidae Moniliformis moniliformis Gigantorhynchida Mediorhynchus sp.

Species[edit] There are six valid species in the genus Gigantorhynchus,[3][7] although one species out of the six, G. pesteri, appears to be incorrectly assigned.[2] Gigantorhynchus echinodiscus (Diesing, 1851)[8][f] G. echinodiscus is a tropical parasite of anteaters including the giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), the southern tamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla) and the silky anteater (Cyclopes didactylus).[2] It has been found in Brazil,[2] Venezuela,[9] Panama,[10] and Trinidad Island.[11] Intermediate hosts include two species of termites from Brazil (Labiotermes emersoni and Orthognathotermes heberi).[12] It is the first species to be described in the genus Gigantorhynchus and is the type species.[3] Morphological traits used to distinguish the species include a cylindrical proboscis with a crown having eighteen large hooks followed by 21 to 23 small rootless spines arranged in two longitudinal rows. The first row has six hooks measuring between 0.16 and 0.23 mm from the tip of the hook to the root. The second row has twelve hooks in pairs which are smaller than first row measuring between 0.18 and 0.19 mm from the tip of the hook to the root. The crown is separated from numerous small, rootless spines by a short space without hooks. Twenty-one to twenty-three small, rootless spines are arranged in longitudinal rows 0.05 to 0.08 mm long. The lemnisci reach the middle of the trunk and are sometimes bent back on themselves. Other traits include a lateral papilla at the base of the proboscis, a small region (2.24 to 3.21 mm long) after the proboscis with no segmentation, a ringed with no complete segmentation, large testes, eight cement glands in pairs occupying a region measuring between 0.98 and 2.13 mm long and between 0.45 and 0.76 mm wide, and a non-segmented region in the posterior end of the body.[2] The male has two ellipsoid testes that are narrow and in tandem. The posterior end after the anterior testes without a segmented region measures between 5.45 and 8.53 mm. In the female, the gonopore is subterminal and the vagina has a sinuous lateral region shaped like a guitar. The genital pore including the vagina, uterus, and uterine bell is between 0.69 and 0.97 mm long. The eggs contain three membranes.[2] Gigantorhynchus lopezneyrai Diaz-ungria, 1958[9] G. lopezneyrai has been found parasitizing the Southern tamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla) in Venezuela.[2] The trunk is slightly segmented and no female measurements were taken in its original description. There are twelve hooks on the proboscis (4 in the first circle each around 0.235 mm long, and 8 in the second circle each around 0.106 mm long). The eight cement glands are organized in pairs.[2] Amato (2014) raised doubts about the validity of this species suggesting that the hook number and arrangement is an incorrect observation that needs to be revisited as no drawings of the proboscis showing the hook formation was published.[12] This species is named in honour of Carlos Rodríguez López-Neyra de Gorgot, a Spanish parasitologist.[9] Gigantorhynchus lutzi Machado, 1941[13] G. lutzi has been found parasitising a Bare-tailed woolly opossum (Caluromys philander) in Pará, Brazil[2] and infesting the small intestine of the Common opossum (Didelphis marsupialis) in Huánuco, Peru.[14] It was the second species in the genus Gigantorhynchus to be described. The body is ringed with no complete segmentation. There are twelve hooks on the proboscis including six in the first circle each measuring 0.285 by 0.165 mm, and six in the second circle measuring 0.225 by 0.135 mm. The eight cement glands are organized in pairs.[2] Gigantorhynchus ortizi Sarmiento, 1954[15] G. ortizi has been found infesting the intestines of the Brown four-eyed opossum (Metachirus nudicaudatus) and possibly a White-bellied slender opossum (Marmosops cf. noctivagus) both between Iquitos and Nauta in Peru.[16] Another survey found nearly 100% of the Brown four-eyed opossum were infected with this parasite in the Darien Province of Panama and the Departments of Chocó, Meta, and Nariño in Colombia. Infestations ranged from 20 to 60 worms per host almost completely obstructing the intestines in several of the sampled hosts.[17] The trunk pseudosegmented[15] or slightly segmented.[2] There are twelve hooks on the proboscis (six in the first circle each measuring 0.160 by 0.10 mm, and six in the second circle measuring 0.140 by 0.09 mm). The eight cement glands are organized in groups. It was named in honour of Dr. Javier Ortiz de La Puente, a Peruvian ornithologist from the Museum of the University of San Marcos, Lima, Peru who collected the brown four-eyed opossum from La Merced, Junin, Peru, which later was determined to have been infested with this new species of acanthocephalan.[15] Gigantorhynchus pesteri Tadros, 1966[18] G. pesteri was recorded from an unknown baboon species in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe).[12][18] Gomes (2019) considers this Gigantorhynchus species to be incorrectly assigned due to a lack of information including missing registration number and deposit of specimen in a co contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 62 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Gigantorhynchus_echinodiscus responseCode 3 200
