History[edit] The cover of the newspaper's first edition, on 18 April 1831 Sydney Morning Herald building on the corner of Pitt and Hunter Streets, built 1856, demolished in the 1920s for a larger building The Sydney Herald was founded in 1831 by three employees of the now-defunct Sydney Gazette: Ward Stephens, Frederick Stokes, and William McGarvie. A Centenary Supplement (since digitised) was published in 1931.[9] The original four-page weekly had a print run of 750. The newspaper began to publish daily in 1840, and the operation was purchased in 1841 by an Englishman named John Fairfax who renamed it The Sydney Morning Herald the following year.[10] Fairfax, whose family were to control the newspaper for almost 150 years, based his editorial policies "upon principles of candour, honesty and honour. We have no wish to mislead; no interest to gratify by unsparing abuse or indiscriminate approbation." Donald Murray, who invented a predecessor of the teleprinter, worked at the Herald during the 1890s.[11] A weekly "Page for Women" was added in 1905, edited by Theodosia Ada Wallace.[12] The SMH was late to the trend of printing news rather than just advertising on the front page, doing so from 15 April 1944. Of the country's metropolitan dailies, only The West Australian was later in making the switch. The newspaper launched a Sunday edition, The Sunday Herald, in 1949. Four years later, this was merged with the newly acquired Sun newspaper to create The Sun-Herald, which continues to this day. By the mid-1960s, a new competitor had appeared in Rupert Murdoch's national daily The Australian, which was first published on 15 July 1964. John Fairfax & Sons Limited commemorated the Herald's 150th anniversary in 1981 by presenting the City of Sydney with Stephen Walker's sculpture, Tank Stream Fountain.[13] In 1995, the company launched the newspaper's web edition smh.com.au.[14] The site has since grown to include interactive and multimedia features beyond the content in the print edition. Around the same time, the organisation moved from Jones Street to new offices at Darling Park and built a new printing press at Chullora, in the city's west. The SMH later moved with other Sydney Fairfax divisions to a building at Darling Island. In May 2007, Fairfax Media announced it would be moving from a broadsheet format to the smaller compact or tabloid-size, in the footsteps of The Times, for both The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age.[15] After abandoning these plans later in the year, Fairfax Media again announced in June 2012 its plan to shift both broadsheet newspapers to tabloid size, with effect from March 2013.[16] Fairfax also announced it would cut staff across the entire group by 1,900 over three years and erect paywalls around the papers' websites.[17] The subscription type was to be a freemium model, limiting readers to a number of free stories per month, with a payment required for further access.[18] The announcement was part of an overall "digital first" strategy of increasingly digital or on-line content over printed delivery, to "increase sharing of editorial content," and to assist the management's wish for "full integration of its online, print and mobile platforms."[17] It was announced in July 2013 that the SMH's news director, Darren Goodsir, would become editor-in-chief, replacing Sean Aylmer.[19] On 22 February 2014, the Saturday edition was produced in broadsheet format for the final time, with this too converted to compact format on 1 March 2014,[20] ahead of the decommissioning of the printing plant at Chullora in June 2014.[21] In June 2022, the paper received global coverage and backlash to an attempted outing of Australian actress Rebel Wilson by columnist Andrew Hornery, and the subsequent defence of his since-deleted column by editor Bevan Shields; Wilson pre-empted the Hornery disclosure with an Instagram post confirming her relationship.[22][23][24] Daily Life Woman of the Year[edit] In 2012, Woman of the Year (WOTY) awards were created by the editor of the Daily Life section, Sarah Oakes, inspired by the sexism faced by former prime minister Julia Gillard. Winners were selected as the result of voting by the public as well as a panel of judges appointed by Fairfax. Winners have included:[25] 2012: Julia Gillard[25] 2013: "ADFA Kate"[25] (an RAAF cadet, victim of the "Skype sex scandal" at the Australian Defence Force Academy[26]) 2014: Rosie Batty[25] 2015: Gillian Triggs[27] 2016: Mariam Veiszadeh[28] Editorial stance[edit] The newspaper's editorial stance is generally centrist. According to one commentator it is seen as the most centrist among the three major Australian non-tabloids (the other two being The Australian and The Age).[29] In 2004, the newspaper's editorial page stated: "market libertarianism and social liberalism" were the two "broad themes" that guided the Herald's editorial stance.[30] During the 1999 referendum on whether Australia should become a republic, the Herald (like the other two major papers) strongly supported a "yes" vote.[31] The Sydney Morning Herald did not endorse the Labor Party for federal office in the first six decades of Federation, always endorsing a conservative government.[30] The newspaper has since endorsed Labor in seven federal elections: 1961 (Calwell), 1984 and 1987 (Hawke), 2007 (Rudd), 2010 (Gillard),[32][33], 2019 (Shorten),[34] and 2022 (Albanese).[35] During the 2004 Australian federal election, the Herald did not endorse a party,[30][32] but subsequently resumed its practice of making endorsements.[32] After endorsing the Coalition at the 2013[36] and 2016 federal elections,[37] the newspaper endorsed Bill Shorten's Labor Party in 2019, after Malcolm Turnbull was ousted as prime minister.[34] At the state level, the Herald has consistently backed the Coalition; the only time since 1973[38] that it has endorsed a Labor government for New South Wales was Bob Carr's government in the 2003 election, though it declined to endorse either party three times during this period.[32] The Herald endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run-up for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[39] The Herald endorsed the Liberal-National Coalition in the run-up for the 2023 New South Wales state election.[40] In May 2023, the Herald opposed the extradition of former WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange to the United States, with the newspaper conducting a poll that found 79% oppose Assange's extradition to the United States.[41] Notable contributors[edit] Writers[edit] Waleed Aly Eliza Ashton Louisa Atkinson Julia Baird Lucian Boz Mike Carlton Anne Davies Peter FitzSimons Ross Gittins Richard Glover Peter Hartcher Amanda Hooton Adele Horin H.
