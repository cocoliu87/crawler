Sponsored by Latsis Foundation Reward(s) £10,000 Website www.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/lakatos-award/ The Lakatos Award is given annually for an outstanding contribution to the philosophy of science, widely interpreted.[1] The contribution must be in the form of a monograph, co-authored or single-authored, and published in English during the previous six years. The award is in memory of the influential Hungarian philosopher of science and mathematics Imre Lakatos, whose tenure as Professor of Logic at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) was cut short by his early and unexpected death. While administered by an international management committee organised from the LSE, it is independent of the LSE Department of Philosophy, Logic, and Scientific Method, with many of the committee's members being academics from other institutions. The value of the award, which has been endowed by the Latsis Foundation, is £10,000, and to take it up a successful candidate must visit the LSE and deliver a public lecture. Selection[edit] The award is administered by the following committee: Professor Roman Frigg (Convenor, LSE) Professor Richard Bradley (LSE) Professor Hasok Chang (University of Cambridge) Professor Nancy Cartwright (University of Durham) Professor Kostas Gavroglu (University of Athens) Professor Helen Longino (Stanford University) Professor Samir Okasha (University of Bristol) Professor Sabina Leonelli (University of Exeter) The Committee makes the Award on the advice of an independent and anonymous panel of selectors.
