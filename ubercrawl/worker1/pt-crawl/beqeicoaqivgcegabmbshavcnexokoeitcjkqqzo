It will serve the Choa Chu Kang Neighbourhood 8 as well as Pavilion Park and Tengah Brickland District.[1] History[edit] Brickland station was first announced on 25 May 2019 as part of the Land Transport Authority's (LTA) Land Transport Master Plan 2040.[2] The station was planned to serve approximately 13,000 existing households from Keat Hong, Bukit Batok West, Pavilion Park and Tengah town’s Brickland district, and future residential developments.[3] Officially confirmed on 28 July 2023, the station is targeted to begin construction in 2024 with a completion date of 2034. Construction works for the station will include a new viaduct and crossover tracks.[4][5] The longer construction duration for the infill is due to extensive modification works needed since the section of the line was not designated for an infill station. Construction can only take place during maintenance hours at night.[6] Details[edit] Road level of the future Brickland MRT station Serving the North South line (NSL), Brickland station will be between the Bukit Gombak and Choa Chu Kang stations. The official station code will be NS3A.[7] The station will be constructed along Bukit Batok West Avenue 5 near the junction with Bukit Batok Road.[8] References[edit] ^ Toh, Ting Wei (25 May 2019).
