On X, registered users can post text, images and videos.[13] Users can also "like", repost, quote repost, comment on posts, direct message, video and audio call, bookmark, join lists and communities, and join public Spaces with other registered users. Approved contributors can also leave Community Notes to add context to posts by other registered users. Posting information to the site is often referred to as tweeting, retweeting and quote tweeting. Although the service was renamed to "X", its primary website address remains twitter.com as of November 2023[update], with the x.com domain name redirecting to that address. Twitter was created in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams. It was launched in July of that year. Its parent company, Twitter, Inc., was based in San Francisco, California and had more than 25 offices around the world.[14] By 2012[update], more than 100 million users produced 340 million tweets a day,[15] and the service handled an average of 1.6 billion search queries per day.[16][17][15] In 2013, it was one of the world's ten most-visited websites.[18] By the start of 2019[update], Twitter had more than 330 million monthly active users.[19] In practice, the vast majority of tweets are produced by a minority of users.[20][21] In 2020, it was estimated that approximately 48 million accounts (15% of all accounts) were not genuine people.[22] As of October 2023, Twitter is the 5th most-visited website in the world with 23.6% of its traffic coming from the United States followed by Japan at 15.94% and the United Kingdom at 5.57% according to data provided by Similarweb.[23][24] In October 2022, billionaire Elon Musk acquired Twitter for US$44 billion, gaining control of the platform and becoming CEO.[25][26][27][28] Since the acquisition, the platform has been criticized for the spread of misinformation and disinformation,[29][30][31] facilitating an increase in hate speech,[32][33][34] promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories[35][36] and transphobia.[37][38] Linda Yaccarino succeeded Musk as CEO on June 5, 2023, with Musk remaining as Chairman and CTO.[10][39][40] In July 2023, Musk announced that Twitter would be rebranded to X and that the bird logo would be retired.[41][42] In October 2023, the company estimated its value at about $19 billion, down about 55% from the purchase price one year earlier.[43] Fidelity at about the same time estimated the value to be down 65% from its purchase price.[44] History See also: Timeline of Twitter It has been suggested that this section be split out into another article titled History of Twitter. (Discuss) (November 2023) 2006–2007: Creation and initial reaction A sketch, c. 2006, by Jack Dorsey, envisioning an SMS-based social network X's origins lie in a "daylong brainstorming session" held by board members of the podcasting company Odeo. Jack Dorsey, then an undergraduate student, introduced the idea of an individual using an SMS service to communicate with a small group.[45][46] The original project code name for the service was twttr, an idea that Williams later ascribed to Noah Glass,[47] inspired by Flickr and the five-character length of American SMS short codes. The decision was also partly due to the fact that the domain twitter.com was already in use, and it was six months after the launch of twttr that the crew purchased the domain and changed the name of the service to Twitter.[48] The developers initially considered "10958" as the service's short code for SMS text messaging, but later changed it to "40404" for "ease of use and memorability".[49] Work on the project started in February 2006.[50] Dorsey published the first Twitter message on March 21, 2006, at 12:50 p.m. PST (UTC−08:00): "just setting up my twttr".[3] Dorsey has explained the origin of the "Twitter" title:[51] ...we came across the word "twitter", and it was just perfect. The definition was "a short burst of inconsequential information", and "chirps from birds". And that's exactly what the product was. The first Twitter prototype, developed by Dorsey and contractor Florian Weber, was used as an internal service for Odeo employees.[50] The full version was introduced publicly on July 15, 2006.[8] In October 2006, Biz Stone, Evan Williams, Dorsey, and other members of Odeo formed Obvious Corporation and acquired Odeo, together with its assets—including Odeo.com and Twitter.com—from the investors and shareholders.[52] Williams fired Glass, who was silent about his part in Twitter's startup until 2011.[53] Twitter spun off into its own company in April 2007.[54] Williams provided insight into the ambiguity that defined this early period in a 2013 interview:[55] With Twitter, it wasn't clear what it was. They called it a social network, they called it microblogging, but it was hard to define, because it didn't replace anything. There was this path of discovery with something like that, where over time you figure out what it is. Twitter actually changed from what we thought it was in the beginning, which we described as status updates and a social utility. It is that, in part, but the insight we eventually came to was Twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network. 2007–2010 The tipping point for Twitter's popularity was the 2007 South by Southwest Interactive (SXSWi) conference. During the event, Twitter usage increased from 20,000 tweets per day to 60,000.[56] "The Twitter people cleverly placed two 60-inch plasma screens in the conference hallways, exclusively streaming Twitter messages," remarked Newsweek's Steven Levy. "Hundreds of conference-goers kept tabs on each other via constant twitters. Panelists and speakers mentioned the service, and the bloggers in attendance touted it."[57] Reaction at the conference was highly positive.[58] Twitter staff received the festival's Web Award prize with the remark "we'd like to thank you in 140 characters or less. And we just did!"[59] The company experienced rapid initial growth. In 2009, Twitter won the "Breakout of the Year" Webby Award.[60][61] On November 29, 2009, Twitter was named the Word of the Year by the Global Language Monitor, declaring it "a new form of social interaction".[62] In February 2010, Twitter users were sending 50 million tweets per day.[63] By March 2010, the company recorded over 70,000 registered applications.[64] As of June 2010[update], about 65 million tweets were posted each day, equaling about 750 tweets sent each second, according to Twitter.[65] As of March 2011[update], that was about 140 million tweets posted daily.[66] As noted on Compete.com, Twitter moved up to the third-highest-ranking social networking site in January 2009 from its previous rank of twenty-second.[67] Jack Dorsey, co-founder and former CEO of Twitter, in 2009 Twitter's usage spikes during prominent events. For example, a record was set during the 2010 FIFA World Cup when fans wrote 2,940 tweets per second in the thirty-second period after Japan scored against Cameroon on June 14, 2010. The record was broken again when 3,085 tweets per second were posted after the Los Angeles Lakers' victory in the 2010 NBA Finals on June 17, 2010,[68] and then again at the close of Japan's victory over Denmark in the World Cup when users published 3,283 tweets per second.[69] The record was set again during the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup Final between Japan and the United States, when 7,196 tweets per second were published.[70] When American singer Michael Jackson died on June 25, 2009, Twitter servers crashed after users were updating their status to include the words "Michael Jackson" at a rate of 100,000 tweets per hour.[71] The current record as of August 3, 2013[update], was set in Japan, with 143,199 tweets per second during a television screening of the movie Castle in the Sky[72] (beating the previous record of 33,388, also set by Japan for the television screening of the same movie).[73] The first unassisted off-Earth Twitter message was posted from the International Space Station by NASA astronaut T. J. Creamer on January 22, 2010.[74] By late November 2010, an average of a dozen updates per day were posted on the astronauts' communal account, @NASA_Astronauts.
