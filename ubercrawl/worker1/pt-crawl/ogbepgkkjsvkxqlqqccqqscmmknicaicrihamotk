A non-binding Catalan self-determination referendum, also known as the Citizen Participation Process on the Political Future of Catalonia,[1] was held on Sunday, 9 November 2014, to gauge support on the political future of Catalonia. While also referred to as "Catalan independence referendum",[2][3][4] the vote was rebranded as a "participation process" by the Government of Catalonia, after a "non-referendum popular consultation" on the same topic and for the same date had been suspended by the Constitutional Court of Spain.[5] The ballot papers carried two questions: "Do you want Catalonia to become a State?" and "Do you want this State to be independent?" The second question could only be answered by those who had answered Yes to the first one.[6] The Catalan government gave notice on 10 November, the day after voting, that 2,305,290 votes had been cast overall,[7] but it did not provide a percentage figure for the turnout. Estimates for the turnout as published by the news media ranged from 37.0%, as given in The Economist and El País among others,[8][9][10] to 41.6% as per the Catalan government's preliminary data.[11] 80.8% of the cast votes supported the Yes–Yes option, 10.1% the Yes–No, 4.5% the No option. Holding a referendum about the "political future of Catalonia" in 2014 was one of the items of the governance agreement ratified by Artur Mas from Convergence and Union (CiU) and Oriol Junqueras from Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) on 18 December 2012,[12][13][14][15] that allowed Artur Mas to be voted in as President of the Generalitat of Catalonia for a second term. On 19 September 2014, the Catalan parliament approved a call for a referendum on independence.[16] Eight days later Artur Mas announced that the vote was to be held on 9 November 2014.[17] The same day the Spanish government announced that it would block the effort by appealing to the Constitutional Court of Spain.[18] The Court decided to hear the Spanish government's case on 29 September 2014, and provisionally suspended the vote.[19] The Catalan Government subsequently announced the "temporary suspension" of the referendum campaign.[20] On 14 October, Artur Mas proposed a "process of citizen participation" as an alternative to the original referendum.[21] The Spanish government announced that it would also block this effort by appealing to the Constitutional Court, which decided to hear the Spanish government's case on 4 November 2014, and provisionally suspended the vote. The Catalan Government, however, pushed forward with the "citizen participation" process, in defiance of the Constitutional Court,[22] and voting took place as planned on 9 November 2014. Background[edit] 2009–2012[edit] Unofficial Catalan independence referendums[edit] Main article: 2009–2011 Catalan independence referendums In 2009 and 2011 unofficial referendums took place in hundreds of Catalan towns as one of the many actions included in the independentist-wing-parties' platforms; in the referendums the pro-independence option won an overwhelming majority of the votes cast, although the participation rate was very low. Demonstrations in Barcelona[edit] Main articles: 2010 Catalan autonomy protest and 2012 Catalan independence demonstration In 2010 and 2012 different demonstrations took place in Barcelona. The first one took place on 10 July 2010. It featured a Catalan regionalist ideological leadership. The second one on 11 September 2012 was openly in favor of Catalan independence and had as a slogan "Catalonia, next state in Europe". As a consequence of this second demonstration, the Rt. Hon. Artur Mas, President of the Generalitat of Catalonia at that time, called a snap election, and the "Agreement for Freedom" was negotiated between Artur Mas (CiU "Conservativel local party") and Oriol Junqueras (ERC, Republican and socialistic-style left party). The Protest "Som una nació, nosaltres decidim" on 10 July 2010 at the junction of Passeig de Gràcia and Carrer d'Aragó.[23] The Demonstration "Catalunya, nou estat d'Europa" of 11 September 2012.[24] Estelada hanging between Carrer de Mallorca and Carrer de València, along Passeig de Gracia.

Free Catalan Territories[edit] Main article: Free Catalan Territory Also, during 2012, dozens of Catalan towns declared themselves Free Catalan Territory stating that "the Spanish legislation and regulations have effect only in Spain, so this town will wait for new legislation and regulation from the Catalan Government and the Parliament of Catalonia." Resolution of the Catalan Parliament for Holding an Independence Referendum[edit] The Catalan independence referendum is planned to take place during the tenth legislature of the Parliament of Catalonia. According to a resolution adopted by the Parliament of Catalonia on 27 September 2012: The Parliament of Catalonia confirms the need for the people of Catalonia to be able to freely and democratically determine their collective future and urges the government to hold a referendum during the following legislature.[25] The resolution was adopted after the general policy debate. It received 84 favourable votes, 21 against and 25 abstentions.[26] The President of the Generalitat of Catalonia, Artur Mas, declared in a speech to Parliament that it was time for the people of Catalonia to exercise the right of self-determination.[27] 2013[edit] Declaration of Sovereignty[edit] Main article: Catalan Sovereignty Declaration Results of the votes for the "Declaration of sovereignty" at the Catalan Parliament, on 23 January 2013 On 23 January 2013 the Parliament of Catalonia adopted by 85 favourable votes, 41 against, and 2 abstentions the "Declaration of Sovereignty and of the Right to Decide of the Catalan People".[28][29][30] It states that "The people of Catalonia have – by reason of democratic legitimacy – the character of a sovereign political and legal entity." Five Socialist MPs did not vote. It is based on the following principles: sovereignty, democratic legitimacy, transparency, dialogue, social cohesion, Europeanism, legality, role of the Catalan Parliament and participation.[31][32][33] In accordance with the democratically expressed will of the majority of the Catalan public, the Parliament of Catalonia initiates a process to bring to promote the right of the citizens of Catalonia to collectively decide their political future.[31] The political parties Convergence and Union (CiU) (50 yes), Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) (21 yes) and Initiative for Catalonia Greens-United and Alternative Left (ICV-EUiA) (13 yes) totally supported the statement of sovereignty. On the other hand, the People's Party of Catalonia (PPC) (19 no) and Citizens – Party of the Citizenry (C's) (9 no) totally opposed the proposal. 15 members of the Socialists' Party of Catalonia (PSC) voted against; 5 did not vote despite being present in the Chamber, thus disobeying the orders of the party whips to vote against the proposal. Finally, the Popular Unity Candidature (CUP) gave a "critical yes", with 1 vote in favour and 2 abstentions.[32] On 8 May 2013 this purely political declaration was provisionally suspended by the Constitutional Court of Spain.[34][35] Date and wording[edit] On 12 December 2013, the Government of Catalonia announced that a deal between Catalan nationalist parties had set the date and wording for the referendum on independence. The date would be 9 November 2014 and that it will contain a question with two sections: "Do you want Catalonia to become a State?" and "In case of an affirmative response, do you want this State to be independent?".[36][37] The date was chosen as it would allow for discussions with the Spanish Government in order "to stage the consultation legally", but the Spanish Government stated shortly thereafter its intention to block the referendum, stating: "Such a poll will not be held."[38][39] Mariano Rajoy, Spanish Prime Minister, said that the referendum would be considered illegal and that "any discussion or debate on this is out of the question".[38][40] Ballot questions[edit] Ballot question (in Catalan and Spanish) According to the consultation decree, "in the consultation there is a first question followed successively by a second question, and they are worded as follows: a) Do you want Catalonia to become a State? (Yes/No); If so: b) Do you want this State to be independent? (Yes/No). You can only answer the question under Letter b) in the event of having answered "Yes" to the question under Letter a)."[6] The "participation contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 76 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/2014_Catalan_self-determination_referendum responseCode 3 200
