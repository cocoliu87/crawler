This solution has many unusual properties—in particular, the existence of closed time-like curves that would allow time travel in a universe described by the solution. Its definition is somewhat artificial, since the value of the cosmological constant must be carefully chosen to correspond to the density of the dust grains, but this spacetime is an important pedagogical example. Definition[edit] Like any other Lorentzian spacetime, the Gödel solution represents the metric tensor in terms of a local coordinate chart. It may be easiest to understand the Gödel universe using the cylindrical coordinate system (see below), but this article uses the chart originally used by Gödel. In this chart, the metric (or, equivalently, the line element) is g = 1 2 ω 2 [ − ( d t + e x d y ) 2 + d x 2 + 1 2 e 2 x d y 2 + d z 2 ] , − ∞ < t , x , y , z < ∞ , {\displaystyle g={\frac {1}{2\omega ^{2}}}\left[-(dt+e^{x}\,dy)^{2}+dx^{2}+{\tfrac {1}{2}}e^{2x}\,dy^{2}+dz^{2}\right],\qquad -\infty <t,x,y,z<\infty ,} where ω {\displaystyle \omega } is a non-zero real constant that gives the angular velocity of the surrounding dust grains about the y-axis, measured by a "non-spinning" observer riding on one of the dust grains. "Non-spinning" means that the observer does not feel centrifugal forces, but in this coordinate system, it would rotate about an axis parallel to the y-axis. In this rotating frame, the dust grains remain at constant values of x, y, and z. Their density in this coordinate diagram increases with x, but their density in their own frames of reference is the same everywhere. Properties[edit] To investigate the properties of the Gödel solution, the frame field can be assumed (dual to the co-frame read from the metric as given above), e → 0 = 2 ω ∂ t {\displaystyle {\vec {e}}_{0}={\sqrt {2}}\omega \,\partial _{t}} e → 1 = 2 ω ∂ x {\displaystyle {\vec {e}}_{1}={\sqrt {2}}\omega \,\partial _{x}} e → 2 = 2 ω ∂ y {\displaystyle {\vec {e}}_{2}={\sqrt {2}}\omega \,\partial _{y}} e → 3 = 2 ω ( exp ⁡ ( − x ) ∂ z − ∂ t ) . {\displaystyle {\vec {e}}_{3}=2\omega \,\left(\exp(-x)\,\partial _{z}-\partial _{t}\right).} This framework defines a family of inertial observers that are 'comoving with the dust grains'. The computation of the Fermi–Walker derivatives with respect to e → 0 {\displaystyle {\vec {e}}_{0}} shows that the spatial frames are spinning about e → 2 {\displaystyle {\vec {e}}_{2}} with the angular velocity − ω {\displaystyle -\omega } . It follows that the 'non spinning inertial frame' comoving with the dust particles is f → 0 = e → 0 {\displaystyle {\vec {f}}_{0}={\vec {e}}_{0}} f → 1 = cos ⁡ ( ω t ) e → 1 − sin ⁡ ( ω t ) e → 3 {\displaystyle {\vec {f}}_{1}=\cos(\omega t)\,{\vec {e}}_{1}-\sin(\omega t)\,{\vec {e}}_{3}} f → 2 = e → 2 {\displaystyle {\vec {f}}_{2}={\vec {e}}_{2}} f → 3 = sin ⁡ ( ω t ) e → 1 + cos ⁡ ( ω t ) e → 3 . {\displaystyle {\vec {f}}_{3}=\sin(\omega t)\,{\vec {e}}_{1}+\cos(\omega t)\,{\vec {e}}_{3}.} Einstein tensor[edit] The components of the Einstein tensor (with respect to either frame above) are G a ^ b ^ = ω 2 diag ⁡ ( − 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 ) + 2 ω 2 diag ⁡ ( 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 ) . {\displaystyle G^{{\hat {a}}{\hat {b}}}=\omega ^{2}\operatorname {diag} (-1,1,1,1)+2\omega ^{2}\operatorname {diag} (1,0,0,0).} Here, the first term is characteristic of a Lambdavacuum solution and the second term is characteristic of a pressureless perfect fluid or dust solution. The cosmological constant is carefully chosen to partially cancel the matter density of the dust. Topology[edit] The Gödel spacetime is a rare example of a regular (singularity-free) solution of the Einstein field equation. Gödel's original chart is geodesically complete and free of singularities. Therefore, it is a global chart, and the spacetime is homeomorphic to R4, and therefore, simply connected. Curvature invariants[edit] In any Lorentzian spacetime, the fourth rank Riemann tensor is a multilinear operator on the four-dimensional space of tangent vectors (at some event), but a linear operator on the six-dimensional space of bivectors at that event. Accordingly, it has a characteristic polynomial, whose roots are the eigenvalues. In Gödelian spacetime, these eigenvalues are very simple: triple eigenvalue zero, double eigenvalue − ω 2 {\displaystyle -\omega ^{2}} , single eigenvalue ω 2 {\displaystyle \omega ^{2}} . Killing vectors[edit] This spacetime admits a five-dimensional Lie algebra of Killing vectors, which can be generated by 'time translation' ∂ t {\displaystyle \partial _{t}} , two 'spatial translations' ∂ y , ∂ z {\displaystyle \partial _{y},\;\partial _{z}} , plus two further Killing vector fields: ∂ x − y ∂ y {\displaystyle \partial _{x}-y\,\partial _{y}} and − 2 exp ⁡ ( − x ) ∂ t + y ∂ y + ( exp ⁡ ( − 2 x ) − y 2 / 2 ) ∂ y . {\displaystyle -2\exp(-x)\,\partial _{t}+y\,\partial _{y}+\left(\exp(-2x)-y^{2}/2\right)\,\partial _{y}.} The isometry group acts 'transitively' (since we can translate into t , y , z {\displaystyle t,y,z} , and with the fourth vector we can move along x {\displaystyle x} ), so spacetime is 'homogeneous'. However, it is not 'isotropic', as can be seen. The given demonstrators show that the slices x = x 0 {\displaystyle x=x_{0}} admit a transitive abelian three-dimensional transformation group, so that a quotient of the solution can be reinterpreted as a stationary cylindrically symmetric solution. The slices y = y 0 {\displaystyle y=y_{0}} allow for an SL(2,R) action, and the slices t = t 0 {\displaystyle t=t_{0}} admit a Bianchi III (c.f. the fourth Killing vector field). This can be rewritten as the symmetry group containing three-dimensional subgroups with examples of Bianchi types I, III, and VIII. Four of the five Killing vectors, as well as the curvature tensor do not depend on the coordinate y. The Gödel solution is the Cartesian product of a factor R with a three-dimensional Lorentzian manifold (signature −++). It can be shown that, except for the local isometry, the Gödel solution is the only perfect fluid solution of the Einstein field equation which admits a five-dimensional Lie algebra of the Killing vectors. Petrov type and Bel decomposition[edit] The Weyl tensor of the Gödel solution has Petrov type D. This means that for an appropriately chosen observer, the tidal forces are very close to those that would be felt from a point mass in Newtonian gravity. To study the tidal forces in more detail, the Bel decomposition of the Riemann tensor can be computed into three pieces, the tidal or electrogravitic tensor (which represents tidal forces), the magnetogravitic tensor (which represents spin-spin forces on spinning test particles and other gravitational effects analogous to magnetism), and the topogravitic tensor (which represents the spatial sectional curvatures). Observers comoving with the dust particles would observe that the tidal tensor (with respect to u → = e → 0 {\displaystyle {\vec {u}}={\vec {e}}_{0}} , which components evaluated in our frame) has the form E [ u → ] m ^ n ^ = ω 2 diag ⁡ ( 1 , 0 , 1 ) . {\displaystyle {E\left[{\vec {u}}\right]}_{{\hat {m}}{\hat {n}}}=\omega ^{2}\operatorname {diag} (1,0,1).} That is, they measure isotropic tidal tension orthogonal to the distinguished direction ∂ y {\displaystyle \partial _{y}} . The gravitomagnetic tensor vanishes identically B [ u → ] m ^ n ^ = 0. {\displaystyle {B\left[{\vec {u}}\right]}_{{\hat {m}}{\hat {n}}}=0.} This is an artifact of the unusual symmetries of this spacetime, and implies that the putative "rotation" of the dust does not have the gravitomagnetic effects usually associated with the gravitational field produced by rotating matter. The principal Lorentz invariants of the Riemann tensor are R a b c d R a b c d = 12 ω 4 , R a b c d ⋆ R a b c d = 0. {\displaystyle R_{abcd}\,R^{abcd}=12\omega ^{4},\;R_{abcd}{{}^{\star }R}^{abcd}=0.} The vanishing of the second invariant means that some observers measure no gravitomagnetism, which is consistent with what was just said. The fact that the first invariant (the Kretschmann invariant) is constant reflects the homogeneity of the Gödel spacetime.
