It was held in England and Wales from 1 to 18 June 2017.[1] Pakistan won the competition for the first time with a 180-run victory over India in the final at The Oval.[2] The margin of victory was the largest by any team in the final of an ICC ODI tournament in terms of runs.[3] The top eight teams in the ICC ODI Championship rankings as on 30 September 2015 qualified for the tournament, and were divided into two groups of four. Bangladesh returned to the ICC Champions Trophy for the first time since 2006, while the West Indies failed to qualify for the first time. Security around the tournament was increased following the Ariana Grande concert attack in Manchester, just before the start of the competition. The International Cricket Council (ICC) announced that they would review security concerns.[4][5] The ICC Champions Trophy was due to end in 2013, with the 2013 competition the final one, to be replaced by the ICC World Test Championship in 2017.[6] However, in January 2014 it was instead confirmed by the ICC that a Champions Trophy tournament would take place in 2017. In 2016, the ICC confirmed that the Champions Trophy would be scrapped after this tournament, keeping in line with the ICC's goal of having one tournament for each of the three formats of international cricket.[7] In November 2021, the ICC confirmed that the tournament would return in 2025, hosted in Pakistan.[8] Summary[edit] Rain and poor weather affected 5 of the 15 matches played in the tournament.[9] The top two teams in the ICC ODI Rankings at the time (South Africa and Australia) were knocked out in the group stage, with Australia not winning a single game out of their three.[10] 2015 World Cup finalists New Zealand were also knocked out in the group stage, also not winning a single game. Thus, England and Bangladesh from Group A, and India and Pakistan from Group B qualified for the semi-finals. Pakistan beat England comfortably in the first semi-final, winning by 8 wickets with almost 13 overs to spare to make their first final ever in the Champions Trophy. India beat Bangladesh in the second semi-final, also winning comfortably by 9 wickets, in what was Bangladesh's first semi-final in an ICC tournament.[11] The prize money for the 2017 edition of the ICC Champions Trophy was increased by half a million dollars from 2013 to a total of $4.5 million. The winning team got a cheque of $2.2 million and the runner-up got $1.1 million. The other two semifinalists earned $450,000 each. Teams finishing third in each group took home $90,000 each, while the teams finishing last in each group got $60,000 each.[12] Qualification[edit] As hosts, England qualified for the competition automatically; they were joined by the seven other highest-ranked teams in the ICC ODI Championship as at 30 September 2015.[13] Qualification Date Berths Country Host January 2014 1 England ODI Championship 30 September 2015 7 Australia India South Africa New Zealand Sri Lanka Bangladesh Pakistan Venues[edit] On 1 June 2016, it was announced that the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy would be held across three venues: The Oval, Edgbaston and Sophia Gardens.[14] The ICC confirmed the umpires for all matches and venues on 18 May 2017.[15] London Birmingham Cardiff The Oval Edgbaston Cricket Ground Sophia Gardens Capacity: 26,000 Capacity: 23,500 Capacity: 15,643 Squads[edit] Main article: 2017 ICC Champions Trophy squads The eight participating teams were required to announce a 15-member squad for the tournament on or before 25 April 2017.[16] Teams could make changes to their originally named squads up to 25 May 2017, after which date changes would only be accepted on medical grounds, subject to approval.[17] India did not announce their squad by 25 April deadline due to what it described as "operational" reasons, although this was widely seen as a protest by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in an ongoing disagreement with the ICC over finance and governance.[17] The BCCI were scheduled to announce the squad for India after the ICC board meeting on 27 April 2017.[18] However, on 4 May 2017, after no team had been named, the committee of administrators told the BCCI to select their squad immediately.[19] The BCCI undertook a special general meeting on 7 May 2017 to determine what course of action they would take.[20] The outcome of that meeting was that India would take part in the tournament,[21] and the squad was named on 8 May 2017.[22] On 10 May 2017, the ICC confirmed all the squads for the tournament. Pakistan's Shoaib Malik played in his sixth consecutive Champions Trophy.[23] Warm-up matches[edit] Main article: 2017 ICC Champions Trophy warm-up matches Before the tournament started, England and South Africa played a bilateral three-match ODI series leaving the other six teams to play warm-ups against two other teams not in their group. These warm-up matches had rules that were slightly different from normal ODI matches, and were thus not recognised as ODIs. A team could use up to 15 players in a match, but only 11 could bat (or field at any one time) in each innings. Group stage[edit] The fixtures were announced on 1 June 2016.[24][25] Tiebreakers The teams are ranked according to points (2 for a win, 1 for a tied, abandoned or no result game, and 0 for loss). If two or more teams are equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following criteria are applied in the order given to determine the rankings:[26] The team with the most wins in the Group matches will be placed in the higher position. If there are teams with equal points and equal wins, the team with the higher net run rate in the Group matches will be placed in the higher position If two or more teams are still equal, they will be ordered according to the head-to-head matches played between them (points then net run rate in those matches). In the highly unlikely event that teams cannot be separated by the above, teams will be ordered according to their seeded group position. If all matches within a Group are a no result, the top 2 teams by their seeded group positions will progress to the semi-finals.
