For the notability guideline, see Wikipedia:Notability (numbers). This guideline is a part of the English Wikipedia's Manual of Style. It is a generally accepted standard that editors should attempt to follow, though it is best treated with common sense, and occasional exceptions may apply. Any substantive edit to this page should reflect consensus. When in doubt, discuss first on the talk page.

The aim is to promote clarity, cohesion, and consistency, and to make the encyclopedia easier and more intuitive to use. For numbers, dates, and similar items in Wikipedia article titles, see the "Naming conventions (numbers and dates)" guideline. Where this manual gives options, maintain consistency within an article unless there is a good reason to do otherwise. The Arbitration Committee has ruled that editors should not change an article from one guideline-defined style to another without a substantial reason unrelated to mere choice of style; revert-warring over optional styles is unacceptable.[a] If discussion fails to resolve the question of which style to use in an article, defer to the style used by the first major contributor. General notes[edit] Quotations, titles, etc.[edit] See also: Wikipedia:Manual of Style § Quotations Quotations, titles of books and articles, and similar "imported" text should be faithfully reproduced, even if they use formats or units inconsistent with these guidelines or with other formats in the same article. If necessary, clarify via [bracketed interpolation], article text, or footnotes. Non-breaking spaces[edit] Guidance on the use of non-breaking spaces ("hard spaces") is given in some sections below, but not all situations in which hard spaces ({{nbsp}} or &nbsp;) or {{nowrap}} may be appropriate are described. For further information see Wikipedia:Manual of Style § Non-breaking spaces and Wikipedia:Line-break handling. Chronological items[edit] Statements likely to become outdated[edit] Shortcuts MOS:SINCE MOS:DATED MOS:CURRENT See also: Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch § Relative time references, Wikipedia:Updating information, and Wikipedia:As of Except on pages that are inherently time-sensitive and updated regularly (e.g. the "Current events" portal), terms such as now, today, currently, present, to date, so far, soon, upcoming, ongoing, and recently should usually be avoided in favor of phrases such as during the 2010s, since 2010, and in August 2020. Wording can usually be modified to remove the "now" perspective: not she is the current director but she became director on 1 January 2023; not 2010–present but beginning in 2010 or since 2010. Terms likely to go out of date include best known for, holds the record for, etc.[b] For current and future events, use phrases such as as of November 2023 or since the beginning of 2023 to signal the time-dependence of the information; use the template {{as of}} (or {{updated}}) in conjunction. Relative-time expressions are acceptable for very long periods, such as geological epochs: Humans diverged from other primates long ago, but only recently developed state legislatures. Dates, months, and years[edit] "WP:YEAR" redirects here. For WikiProject Years, see WP:YEARS. Shortcuts MOS:DATE MOS:DATEFORMAT MOS:YEAR These requirements do not apply to dates in quotations or titles; see Wikipedia:Manual of Style § Quotations. Special rules apply to citations; see Wikipedia:Citing sources § Citation style. See also Wikipedia:Overview of date formatting guidelines. Formats[edit] Acceptable date formats General use Only in limited situations where brevity is helpful[c] Comments 2 September 2001 2 Sep 2001 A comma doesn't follow the year unless otherwise required by context: The 5 May 1922 meeting was cancelled. Except Jones, who left London on 5 March 1847, every delegate attended the signing. September 2, 2001 Sep 2, 2001 A comma follows the year unless other punctuation obviates it: The weather on March 12, 2005, was clear and warm. Everyone remembers July 20, 1969 – when humans first landed on the Moon. 2 September 2 Sep Omit year only where there is no risk of ambiguity: The 2012 London Olympics ran from 25 July to 12 September. January 1 is New Year's Day. September 2 Sep 2 No equivalent for general use 2001-09-02 Use yyyy-mm-dd format only with Gregorian dates from 1583 onward.[d] September 2001 Sep 2001 Shortcut MOS:UNLINKDATES Dates, years, and other chronological items should be linked only when they are relevant to the subject and likely to be useful to a reader; this rule does not apply to articles that are explicitly on a chronological item, e.g. 2002, 19th century (as discussed at Wikipedia:Linking § Chronological items).[e] For issues related to dates in sortable tables, see Help:Sorting § Configuring the sorting and Help:Sorting § Date sorting problems, or consider using {{dts|Nov 1, 2008}}. Phrases such as Fourth of July (or July Fourth, but not July 4th), Cinco de Mayo, Seventh of March Speech, and Sete de Setembro are proper names, to which rules for dates do not apply (A typical Fourth of July celebration includes fireworks).

Consistency[edit] Shortcut MOS:DATEUNIFY Dates in article body text[h] should all use the same format: She fell ill on 25 June 2005 and died on 28 June, not She fell ill on 25 June 2005 and died on June 28. Publication dates in an article's citations should all use the same format, which may be: the format used in the article body text, an abbreviated format from the "Acceptable date formats" table, provided the day and month elements are in the same order as in dates in the article body the format expected in the citation style being used (but all-numeric date formats other than yyyy-mm-dd must still be avoided). For example, publication dates within a single article might be in one, but only one, of these formats (among others): Jones, J. (20 September 2008) Jones, J. (September 20, 2008) If an article uses a template such as {{Use mdy dates}}, Citation Style 1 and 2 templates automatically render dates (|date=, |access-date=, |archive-date=, etc) in the style specified by the "Use" template, regardless of the format they are entered in. See Template:Use mdy dates#Auto-formatting citation template dates. Access and archive dates in an article's citations should all use the same format, which may be: the format used for publication dates in the article (see above); the format expected in the citation style adopted in the article; or yyyy-mm-dd For example, access/archive dates within a single article might be in one, but only one, of these formats (among others): Jones, J.
