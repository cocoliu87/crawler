After retiring from the army, he served as Myanmar’s ambassador to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Maldives and South Africa. He was a leading member of the Myanmar War Veterans Organization.[1] He graduated from the 15th intake of the Defense Services Academy.[2] It was said that he was the mentor of Vice Senior General Soe Win.[3] On 24 September 2022, he was shot dead, along with his son-in-law Ye Tayza, a former army captain, by anti-regime urban guerrilla fighters in Yangon, becoming the highest-ranking junta target killed by resistance groups. He was accused of supporting the junta and encouraging the military to kill people who were against the coup.[4][5] The military council announced in October that it had arrested 10 individuals responsible for Ohn Thwin's death.[6] The military council has condemned the assassination, calling it a deliberate killing of veterans.[7] References[edit] ^ Irrawaddy, The (2022-09-27).
