Archives 1 "Successor project": incorrect term A successor project is one that completely takes over from the first project. More than once here, there's mention of Creative Commons "successor projects", which is impossible because Creative Commons is still operating. I'm sure those projects belong in the article, but there needs to be a better descriptive word for them.

See: https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html Avoinl√§hde (talk) 23:21, 6 March 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] Oppose per Google Ngrams, pageviews (1,800 for free, 130 for open yesterday) and Google search (15 billion hits for free content, but 10 billion for open content). Oh, and this time the pageviews have a lower margin of error; Google shows different Knowledge Engine links for free and open content searches. üê∂ EpicPupper (he/him | talk) 03:21, 14 March 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] Oppose per EpicPupper, also Wikidata will show that the vast majority of other language wikis appear to use words that translate to "free" and I have not found a mention of "open" yet. Our title policies tend to lean more toward actual usage than interpretation of definitions. ASUKITE 00:39, 16 March 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] The discussion above is closed. Please do not modify it. Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page. No further edits should be made to this discussion. Definition of free cultural works The lead confidently asserts that free content are things that meet freedomdefined.org's definition of a free cultural work, with a primary source citation that just links to that definition. It may be how we define it, but is it really the one agreed-upon definition? I don't think it is.Snowmanonahoe (talk ¬∑ contribs ¬∑ typos) 14:12, 2 June 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] For being permanently linked on the main page, this article in general is... not very good. I have no idea where to start improving it though. Frankly, I wonder whether it's even notable.
