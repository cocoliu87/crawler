Probably constructed in the fifth millennium BC, during Britain's Early Neolithic period, today it survives only in a ruined state. Archaeologists have established that long barrows were built by pastoralist communities shortly after the introduction of agriculture to Britain from continental Europe. Representing an architectural tradition of long barrow building that was widespread across Neolithic Europe, Chestnuts Long Barrow belongs to a localised regional style of barrows produced in the vicinity of the River Medway. The long barrows built in this area are now known as the Medway Megaliths. Chestnuts Long Barrow lies near to both Addington Long Barrow and Coldrum Long Barrow on the western side of the river. Two further surviving long barrows, Kit's Coty House and Little Kit's Coty House, as well as the destroyed Smythe's Megalith and possible survivals as the Coffin Stone and White Horse Stone, are on the eastern side of the Medway. The long barrow was built on land previously inhabited in the Mesolithic period. It consisted of a sub-rectangular earthen tumulus, estimated to have been 15 metres (50 feet) in length, with a chamber built from sarsen megaliths on its eastern end. Both inhumed and cremated human remains were placed within this chamber during the Neolithic period, representing at least nine or ten individuals. These remains were found alongside pottery sherds, stone arrow heads, and a clay pendant. In the 4th century AD, a Romano-British hut was erected next to the long barrow. In the 12th or 13th century, the chamber was dug into and heavily damaged, either by treasure hunters or iconoclastic Christians. The mound gradually eroded and was completely gone by the twentieth century, leaving only the ruined stone chamber. The ruin attracted the interest of antiquarians in the 18th and 19th centuries, while archaeological excavation took place in 1957, followed by limited reconstruction. The site is on privately owned land. Name and location[edit] Chestnuts Long Barrow is a scheduled ancient monument,[1] standing on private land belonging to a neighbouring house, Rose Alba.[2] It lies on the slope of a hill and borrows its name from the Chestnuts, an area of woodland that crowns the hill.[3] This name was given to the monument in the mid-20th century; it had previously been known as Stony Warren or Long Warren.[3] The barrow is in the greensand belt, 30 metres (100 feet) above sea level.[1] The underlying geology is a soft sandstone covered with a stratum of white sand.[4] Background[edit] The Early Neolithic was a revolutionary period of British history. Between 4500 and 3800 BC, it saw a widespread change in lifestyle as the communities living in the British Isles adopted agriculture as their primary form of subsistence, abandoning the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that had characterised the preceding Mesolithic period.[5] The change came about through contact with continental European societies, although it is unclear to what extent this can be attributed to an influx of migrants or to indigenous Mesolithic Britons adopting agricultural technologies from the continent.[6] The region of modern Kent would have been key for the arrival of continental European settlers and visitors, because of its position on the estuary of the River Thames and its proximity to the continent.[7] Britain was then largely forested;[8] widespread forest clearance did not occur in Kent until the Late Bronze Age (c. 1000 to 700 BC).[9] Environmental data from the vicinity of the White Horse Stone, a putatively prehistoric monolith near the River Medway, supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and Amygdaloideae (stone-fruit trees).[10] Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the island's Early Neolithic economy was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic life.[11] Medway Megaliths[edit] The construction of long barrows and related funerary monuments took place in various parts of Europe during the Early Neolithic (known distribution pictured) Across Western Europe, the Early Neolithic marked the first period in which humans built monumental structures in the landscape.[12] These structures included chambered long barrows, rectangular or oval earthen tumuli that had a chamber built into one end. Some of these chambers were constructed out of timber, while others were built using large stones, now known as "megaliths".[13] These long barrows often served as tombs, housing the physical remains of the dead within their chamber.[14] Individuals were rarely buried alone in the Early Neolithic, instead being interred in collective burials with other members of their community.[15] These chambered tombs were built all along the Western European seaboard during the Early Neolithic, from southeastern Spain up to southern Sweden, taking in most of the British Isles;[16] the architectural tradition was introduced to Britain from continental Europe in the first half of the fourth millennium BC.[17] Although now all in a ruinous state,[18] at the time of construction the Medway Megaliths would have been some of the largest and most visually imposing Early Neolithic funerary monuments in Britain.[19] Grouped along the River Medway as it cuts through the North Downs,[20] they constitute the most southeasterly group of megalithic monuments in the British Isles,[21] and the only megalithic group in eastern England.[22] The Medway Megaliths can be divided into two clusters between 8 kilometres (5.0 miles) and 10 kilometres (6.2 miles) apart: one to the west of the River Medway and the other on Blue Bell Hill to the east.[23] Chestnuts Long Barrow is part of the western group, which also includes Coldrum Long Barrow and Addington Long Barrow.[24] The eastern group consists of Smythe's Megalith, Kit's Coty House, and Little Kit's Coty House, while various stones on the eastern side of the river, most notably the Coffin Stone and White Horse Stone, may also have been parts of such structures.[25] It is not known if they were all built at the same time, or whether they were constructed in succession;[26] nor is it known if they each served the same function or whether there was a hierarchy in their usage.[27] Map of the Medway Megaliths around the River Medway The Medway long barrows all conformed to the same general design plan,[28] and are all aligned on an east to west axis.[28] Each had a stone chamber at the eastern end of the mound, and they each probably had a stone facade flanking the entrance.[28] They had internal heights of up to 3.0 metres (10 feet), making them taller than most other chambered long barrows in Britain.[29] The chambers were constructed from sarsen, a dense, hard, and durable stone that occurs naturally throughout Kent, having formed out of sand from the Eocene epoch.[30] Early Neolithic builders would have selected blocks from the local area, and then transported them to the site of the monument to be erected.[30] These common architectural features among the Medway Megaliths indicate a strong regional cohesion with no direct parallels elsewhere in the British Isles.[31] Nevertheless, as with other regional groupings of Early Neolithic long barrows—such as the Cotswold-Severn group in south-western Britain—there are also various idiosyncrasies in the different monuments, such as Coldrum's rectilinear shape, the Chestnut Long Barrow's facade, and the long, thin mounds at Addington and Kit's Coty.[32] These variations might have been caused by the tombs being altered and adapted over the course of their use; in this scenario, the monuments would be composite structures.[33] The Medway Megaliths' builders were probably influenced by pre-existing tomb-shrines elsewhere that they were aware of.[34] Whether the builders had grown up locally, or moved into the Medway area from elsewhere is not known.[34] Based on a stylistic analysis of their architectural designs, the archaeologist Stuart Piggott thought that the plan behind the Medway Megaliths had originated in the area around the Low Countries,[35] while fellow archaeologist Glyn Daniel instead believed that the same evidence showed an influence from Scandinavia.[36] John H. Evans instead suggested an origin in Germany,[37] and Ronald F. Jessup thought that their origins could be seen in the Cotswold-Severn megalithic group.[38] Alexander thought that they bore closest similarities with long barrows along the Atlantic coast, perhaps imitating those of either Ireland or Brittany.[39] The archaeologist Paul Ashbee noted that their close clustering in the same area was reminiscent of the megalithic tomb-shrine traditions of continental Northern Europe,[40] and emphasised that the Medway Megaliths were a regional manifestation of a tradition widespread across Early Neolithic Europe.[41] He nevertheless stressed that a precise place of origin was "impossible to indicate" with the available evidence.[42] Design and construction[edit] View looking west across the burial chamber with the facade stones visible on either side Archaeological excavation revealed a Mesolithic layer below the monument, evidenced by much debris produced by flint knapping.[43] During the 1957 excavation of the site, 2,300 Mesolithic flint fragments were found beneath  contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 55 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Chestnuts_Long_Barrow responseCode 3 200
