Hog Farm Talk 02:59, 11 January 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Hog Farm, I usually add the stats for the benefit of !voters ... see Wikipedia talk:Featured article review/Mary Martha Sherwood/archive1 ... I also put them on the FASA page in the same format that Nikkimaria uses when she copies them to records, so she won't have to do the work ... see format at Wikipedia:Featured_article_review/FASA/Records#December_2022 ... I can look in tomorrow ... at 15 pages (10 more to go) of horrible Spanish translated for GamerPro64, I am too tired to think at the moment ... SandyGeorgia (Talk) 03:31, 11 January 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Also, see User:SandyGeorgia/sandbox5 and here. I notify WT:FAC, WT:FAR, and the same WikiProjects as notified on the FAR. I can get to those tomorrow or next if you are too busy ... I like doing those notifications as they help others see that good things can happen at FAR. Bst, SandyGeorgia (Talk) 03:39, 11 January 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] I've added the stats. Will make an attempt at the notifications ...

A couple weeks ago I created this peer review request. However, the article has since been moved, and is now named Kamikaze Hearts. Should the PR also be moved to reflect the new title? â—‡HelenDegenerateâ—† 17:37, 2 March 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] @HelenDegenerate: I think when a page is moved, the peer reviews and GARs are not. When this is closed, feel free to message me and I will make sure it is properly stored on the talk page. Z1720 (talk) 18:04, 2 March 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Coincidence? I think not...[edit] Today's featured article is Meet Kevin Johnson, which you nominated. Regarding this episode: It was part of the show's 4th season Specifically its 8th episode It first aired 15 years ago today With only 16 ordered scripts, this was Lost's shortest season The current year is 2023 And the episode itself has a runtime of 42 minutes (like pretty much every other non-premier/finale episode) Coincidence? ðŸ¤” Kurtis (talk) 23:29, 20 March 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Witchfinder General (film) scheduled for TFA[edit] This is to let you know that the above article has been scheduled as today's featured article for 19 May 2023.

I'm not a friend of "death-dates", but particularly not in this case as he lived under a different calendar. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 20:47, 19 April 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Question from Dcoffee6929 on Wikipedia:General disclaimer (15:41, 22 April 2023)[edit] Hello My question is: How often is Wikipedia updated? --Dcoffee6929 (talk) 15:41, 22 April 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Hi @Dcoffee6929: the text on Wikipedia is continuously updated by volunteers. As soon as a volunteer submits their edit to an article, it is updated on the website.

Ensure that an article on the topic does not already exist, and that it is notable enough by Wikipedia's standards (as indicated at WP:N and WP:GNG). Once you are ready to create the article, please go to articles for creation to create the article. Z1720 (talk) 14:42, 4 May 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] @Z1720 Thanks, I really appreciate your answer.

Rim sim (talk) 09:06, 5 May 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Question from Mcpmusicman (18:05, 16 May 2023)[edit] Hello, I am concerned that the posting for Nakba. There is reference to Professor Constantin Zureiq and his pamphlet of August 5, 1948. However, lacking is the most important few lines of the pamphlet. Zureiq said: "We must admit our mistakes and recognize the extent of our responsibility for the disaster that is our lot. If the Arabs would have participated they could have had a state just like Israel. It was the prompting of other Arabs that they fled and ended up in a stateless situation. Not Israel. --Mcpmusicman (talk) 18:05, 16 May 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] @Mcpmusicman: thanks for asking about this. The Nakba article is a controversial topic of Wikipedia, so editors are more cautious about what is included. Wikipedia also tries to avoid too many quotes (due to copyright issues and clarity) and avoids presenting opinion statements as facts. Zureiq's statement seems to fall in this opinionated zone and I do not think it should be included. If you disagree with me, I suggest posting your argument on the article's talk page and asking for other editors' opinions. Z1720 (talk) 18:13, 16 May 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Thank you. I do disagree because of the continued representing of Israel as the cause of the "Palestinian problem".
