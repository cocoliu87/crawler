(Ping templates like {{u|JoeEditor}} don't work in edit summaries.) Administrators: Please ensure that there is always at least one queue filled at all times, to prevent overdue updates to the Main Page. This page gives an overview of all DYK hooks currently scheduled for promotion to the Main Page. By showing the content of all queues and prep areas in one place, the overview helps administrators see how full the queue are, and also makes it easier for users to check that their hook has been promoted or to find hooks for copy-editing. Hooks removed from queues or prep areas for unresolved issues should have their nominations reopened and retranscluded at the nomination page. You may need to purge this page to get it to display the latest edits. The next update will be produced from Queue 1. After performing a manual update, please update the pointer to the next queue. Current number of hooks on the nominations page Note: See WP:DYKROTATE for when we change between one and two sets per day.
