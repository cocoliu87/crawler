The concept of module generalizes also the notion of abelian group, since the abelian groups are exactly the modules over the ring of integers. Like a vector space, a module is an additive abelian group, and scalar multiplication is distributive over the operation of addition between elements of the ring or module and is compatible with the ring multiplication. Modules are very closely related to the representation theory of groups. They are also one of the central notions of commutative algebra and homological algebra, and are used widely in algebraic geometry and algebraic topology. Introduction and definition[edit] Motivation[edit] In a vector space, the set of scalars is a field and acts on the vectors by scalar multiplication, subject to certain axioms such as the distributive law. In a module, the scalars need only be a ring, so the module concept represents a significant generalization. In commutative algebra, both ideals and quotient rings are modules, so that many arguments about ideals or quotient rings can be combined into a single argument about modules. In non-commutative algebra, the distinction between left ideals, ideals, and modules becomes more pronounced, though some ring-theoretic conditions can be expressed either about left ideals or left modules. Much of the theory of modules consists of extending as many of the desirable properties of vector spaces as possible to the realm of modules over a "well-behaved" ring, such as a principal ideal domain. However, modules can be quite a bit more complicated than vector spaces; for instance, not all modules have a basis, and even those that do, free modules, need not have a unique rank if the underlying ring does not satisfy the invariant basis number condition, unlike vector spaces, which always have a (possibly infinite) basis whose cardinality is then unique. (These last two assertions require the axiom of choice in general, but not in the case of finite-dimensional spaces, or certain well-behaved infinite-dimensional spaces such as Lp spaces.) Formal definition[edit] Suppose that R is a ring, and 1 is its multiplicative identity. A left R-module M consists of an abelian group (M, +) and an operation · : R × M → M such that for all r, s in R and x, y in M, we have r ⋅ ( x + y ) = r ⋅ x + r ⋅ y {\displaystyle r\cdot (x+y)=r\cdot x+r\cdot y} ( r + s ) ⋅ x = r ⋅ x + s ⋅ x {\displaystyle (r+s)\cdot x=r\cdot x+s\cdot x} ( r s ) ⋅ x = r ⋅ ( s ⋅ x ) {\displaystyle (rs)\cdot x=r\cdot (s\cdot x)} 1 ⋅ x = x . {\displaystyle 1\cdot x=x.} The operation · is called scalar multiplication. Often the symbol · is omitted, but in this article we use it and reserve juxtaposition for multiplication in R. One may write RM to emphasize that M is a left R-module. A right R-module MR is defined similarly in terms of an operation · : M × R → M. Authors who do not require rings to be unital omit condition 4 in the definition above; they would call the structures defined above "unital left R-modules". In this article, consistent with the glossary of ring theory, all rings and modules are assumed to be unital.[1] An (R,S)-bimodule is an abelian group together with both a left scalar multiplication · by elements of R and a right scalar multiplication ∗ by elements of S, making it simultaneously a left R-module and a right S-module, satisfying the additional condition (r · x) ∗ s = r ⋅ (x ∗ s) for all r in R, x in M, and s in S. If R is commutative, then left R-modules are the same as right R-modules and are simply called R-modules. Examples[edit] If K is a field, then K-vector spaces (vector spaces over K) and K-modules are identical. If K is a field, and K[x] a univariate polynomial ring, then a K[x]-module M is a K-module with an additional action of x on M that commutes with the action of K on M. In other words, a K[x]-module is a K-vector space M combined with a linear map from M to M. Applying the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain to this example shows the existence of the rational and Jordan canonical forms. The concept of a Z-module agrees with the notion of an abelian group. That is, every abelian group is a module over the ring of integers Z in a unique way. For n > 0, let n ⋅ x = x + x + ... + x (n summands), 0 ⋅ x = 0, and (−n) ⋅ x = −(n ⋅ x). Such a module need not have a basis—groups containing torsion elements do not. (For example, in the group of integers modulo 3, one cannot find even one element which satisfies the definition of a linearly independent set since when an integer such as 3 or 6 multiplies an element, the result is 0. However, if a finite field is considered as a module over the same finite field taken as a ring, it is a vector space and does have a basis.) The decimal fractions (including negative ones) form a module over the integers. Only singletons are linearly independent sets, but there is no singleton that can serve as a basis, so the module has no basis and no rank. If R is any ring and n a natural number, then the cartesian product Rn is both a left and right R-module over R if we use the component-wise operations. Hence when n = 1, R is an R-module, where the scalar multiplication is just ring multiplication. The case n = 0 yields the trivial R-module {0} consisting only of its identity element. Modules of this type are called free and if R has invariant basis number (e.g. any commutative ring or field) the number n is then the rank of the free module. If Mn(R) is the ring of n × n matrices over a ring R, M is an Mn(R)-module, and ei is the n × n matrix with 1 in the (i, i)-entry (and zeros elsewhere), then eiM is an R-module, since reim = eirm ∈ eiM. So M breaks up as the direct sum of R-modules, M = e1M ⊕ ... ⊕ enM. Conversely, given an R-module M0, then M0⊕n is an Mn(R)-module. In fact, the category of R-modules and the category of Mn(R)-modules are equivalent. The special case is that the module M is just R as a module over itself, then Rn is an Mn(R)-module. If S is a nonempty set, M is a left R-module, and MS is the collection of all functions f : S → M, then with addition and scalar multiplication in MS defined pointwise by (f + g)(s) = f(s) + g(s) and (rf)(s) = rf(s), MS is a left R-module. The right R-module case is analogous. In particular, if R is commutative then the collection of R-module homomorphisms h : M → N (see below) is an R-module (and in fact a submodule of NM). If X is a smooth manifold, then the smooth functions from X to the real numbers form a ring C∞(X). The set of all smooth vector fields defined on X form a module over C∞(X), and so do the tensor fields and the differential forms on X. More generally, the sections of any vector bundle form a projective module over C∞(X), and by Swan's theorem, every projective module is isomorphic to the module of sections of some bundle; the category of C∞(X)-modules and the category of vector bundles over X are equivalent. If R is any ring and I is any left ideal in R, then I is a left R-module, and analogously right ideals in R are right R-modules.
