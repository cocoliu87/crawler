Non-free media information and use rationale true for Argentina national football team Description A photo of football player Lionel Messi with the World Cup trophy after winning the 2022 World Cup final Source https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Lionel-Messi-time100-2023.jpg? Article Argentina national football team Portion used Entire image, or a portion of it centering on the main subject, such as the ones found in the specific section of the article Low resolution? The image quality should be reduced such that it cannot be reused elsewhere. Also, the own use of the image would require such resolution reduction as to fit the already existing photo box in the article, and to maintain current formatting of the article Purpose of use To maintain consistency amongst other images in the same section of the article; to better represent the purpose of the image box in the article, as the idea behind the box itself is to highlight the World Cup winning captains for this particular team, and as such, a photo with the trophy is a more accurate representation Replaceable? This photo was taken on the field of the World Cup final's venue. Such photo has to be taken by a FIFA authorised photographer, that has been granted access to the venue. As the situation in which the photo was taken is unique, and access is extremely limited, the photo can't be reproduced, and therefore should be allowed to be used in the article in a fair-use basis Fair useFair use of copyrighted material in the context of Argentina national football team//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Files_for_upload — Ирука13 18:58, 5 October 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] PrincessPeachShowtimeIcon.jpg[edit] Description: Icon for Princess Peach: Showtime!

Examples of this change can be seen at https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/princess-peach-showtime-switch/ and https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Princess-Peach-Showtime--2444445.html.

Description Icon for the "Princess Peach: Showtime!" game Source https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_5/1x1_NSwitch_PrincessPeachShowtime_image380w.jpg Article Princess Peach: Showtime! Portion used Since this is the icon used for the game when opening it on a Nintendo Switch, the portion used would be the entire image. Low resolution? While it is of a slightly higher resolution than the version currently used in the article, there does appear to be higher resolution versions of the same icon elsewhere on the Internet. Since this particular image linked to is the resolution that was uploaded, the only thing that might need to happen would be a reduction in resolution. Purpose of use The purpose of this image is to showcase the icon for the Princess Peach: Showtime! game in a manner that is used on articles such as the ones for Splatoon 3, Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Pikmin 4, and Everybody 1-2-Switch!. Replaceable? Since the icon for the game was created by Nintendo, including both the original version and this updated version, this isn't an image that can be recreated in a manner that would be considered "free content".
