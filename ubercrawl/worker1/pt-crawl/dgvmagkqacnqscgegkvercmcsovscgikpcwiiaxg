History[edit] Fitzcarraldo Editions was founded in 2014 when Jacques Testard bought the English-language rights to Second-Hand Time by Svetlana Alexievich for £3500 at the Frankfurt Book Fair.[4] Alexievich later won the Nobel Prize, netting a "six-figure" sum for the publisher. The name comes from the 1982 Werner Herzog film Fitzcarraldo. The books are designed by Ray O’Meara, using a custom serif typeface called Fitzcarraldo.[5][4] Fitzcarraldo Editions publishes Svetlana Alexievich, Alejandro Zambra, Mathias Énard, Annie Ernaux,[6] Joshua Cohen, Alaa Abd el-Fattah, Olga Tokarczuk, Jon Fosse, Fernanda Melchor, Ian Penman and Paul B. Preciado, among other authors.[4][7] The company's logo shows a bell with the letters F and Z, and relates to the film Fitzcarraldo; it has been described as "a nod to the challenges and commitment necessary to run a successful independent press" with "a play on early printers marks, with the initials F and Z, recalling the symbols of the earliest printed books".[8] References[edit] ^ Batey, Angus (15 September 2019).
