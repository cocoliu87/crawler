A fact from Argentine Confederation appeared on Wikipedia's Main Page in the Did you know column on 11 February 2012 (check views). The text of the entry was as follows: Did you know... that Buenos Aires seceded from the Argentine Confederation from 1852 to 1861? A record of the entry may be seen at Wikipedia:Recent additions/2012/February. The nomination discussion and review may be seen at Template:Did you know nominations/Argentine Confederation. Wikipedia Leadership[edit] I' d say that Urquiza was the leader of the Confederation until Pavón. Clearly Derqui did not exert a greater influence than Urquiza, however his formal position. The category "leadership" is used because of the heterogeneity of both federal and confederal periods, and it does not refer to proper "official" top positions but to effective leadership. --IANVS (talk) 06:34, 4 October 2010 (UTC)Reply[reply] File:Escudo argentino de 1835 2.jpg Nominated for Deletion[edit] An image used in this article, File:Escudo argentino de 1835 2.jpg, has been nominated for deletion at Wikimedia Commons for the following reason: Deletion requests June 2011 What should I do?
