Three of the party members are under police custody. 200.139.139.177 17:14, 31 May 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] I'm tempted to put this up but I don't know. --Golbez 18:05, 31 May 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Do it already. ;) Really, maybe I'm biased, but this is much more relevant to the entire world than some "students protest" --200.139.139.177 04:58, 1 June 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] I am now. --Golbez 05:14, 1 June 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Actually, that "students protest" is "happenning on India" no more. See Talk:Main_Page#Student Protest. - 199.71.174.100 06:40, 1 June 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] I support putting this up on the news page. It is a very high-profile event. --Skenmy 19:00, 31 May 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Actually this is a quite important news item, since Pirate Bay is (was?) one of the largest bittorrent sites on the net, and also because of the very significant impact it has made on the community through it's previously very successful legal campaign. The fact that it is run by a (self-claimed) non-profit organisation (Piratbyrån - Piracy Bureau) that also functions as a lobby organisation for legalization of private file sharing also gives this news weight. The raid also goes against current precedential Swedish law and was instigated by a private (also non-profit, but funded by the music and movie industry) lobby organisation AGAINST private filesharing (Anti-piratbyrån - Anti-piracy bureu). Btw, these are facts, not opinions. =) -- sorry for anonymousity but I don't have time to figure out my password right now. You've got my IP though. John W. Snow Not remotely worthy of inclusion among just 5 odd world headlines. This is a minor story to everyone bar the tech-savvy. It's inclusion here is merely indicitive of Wikipedia's systemic bias, and there being more tech-users here. zoney ♣ talk 12:44, 1 June 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Wow, the one tech story we run in six months is indicative of our systemic bias. I suppose that means our bias towards soccer matches is unimaginable. I considered it better than any of the sports matches that have been nominated (and posted) recently. --Golbez 14:57, 1 June 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Here in Sweden, where the event actually happened, it's head newsline in most newspapers.. Not true. I looked and looked in my paper (Sydsvenskan, also found at sydsvenskan.se). The last two days they have printed two medium-sized articles in the B (Culture) part of the paper. No mention on the frontpage or the A (domestic and world news) part at all. I think we should be sane and don't put this item in ITN. It's just not relevant to most of the world. ❝Sverdrup❞ 13:02, 2 June 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] John W. Snow (pictured) resigns as Secretary of the Treasury, George W.

(First in 100 years to get a second consecutive term, according to the article, but there is no citation.) -- 199.71.174.100 03:24, 30 May 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] This is more recent than 6 of the 7 items on ITN right now. -- 199.71.174.100 06:43, 1 June 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] May 27, 2006 The New Zealand rugby union side, the Crusaders defeat the Hurricanes 19-12 in the 2006 Super 14 Final in Christchurch. --Hamedog Hello, anyone. This has been up for a while now. Big Sporting news in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. I like this, but the fairuse logo can't be used on the Main Page. -- 199.71.174.100 15:12, 28 May 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Why hasn't this been added, yet? It is the provincial competition of three of the best teams in rugby union. The Heineken Cup was put up a week ago, why not the Southern Hemisphere equlivant???--HamedogTalk|@ 08:47, 30 May 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] It's my personal opinion that these sporting events don't really belong; I didn't support the first one, so I feel no obligation to put this one up for balance. As always, one of the other 900 or so admins may disagree. And I don't understand what "New Zealand rugby union side" means. --Golbez 08:58, 30 May 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Hmmm. It is not just a domestic competition (it is a competition that includes three nations; Australia, New Zealand and South Africa), so it is more notable than say just a domestic comp, for its wider audience. In saying that, the Heinken Cup spans England, Wales, Ireland, France, Scotland and Italy, and it is probably a much bigger 'event'. It is probably a safe bet that (as of now) the only rugby union events that will get put up would be the Rugby World Cup, Six Nations Championship, Tri Nations Series and the Heineken Cup (as in, the winner annoncement/final). But I do think this game should have been mentioned, mainly because of its bizarre weather, something we may never see again, at least not for a long time. I don't know, anyway, lets work on that final page Hame.

Rather stubby. Seems that Wikipedia doesn't have much material on this topic to feature.

Interesting to read, but not really encyclopedic, and thus not a good candidate for ITN. Probably good for DYK, though. -- 199.71.174.100 15:31, 28 May 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] May 25, 2006 Nur-Pashi Kulayev, the only surviving hostage-taker of the Belsan hostage crisis, is sentenced to life in prison Will (E@) T 18:17, 26 May 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] At 3:35 PM MT, the Senate of The United States of America Voted in a 51-47 vote, to pass the bill S.2611 which adds changes to the ongoing immigration debate in the United States No links, no bolded article, no updated article, a non-story (doesn't matter til the president signs), etc... please read the guidelines. --Golbez 22:08, 25 May 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Scientists confirm the theory that the HIV virus originated among wild chimpanzees in Cameroon.

Not sure if History of East Timor is the best page to be updated with these recent events, either. It's too early to tell if the recent violence will be a notable event in the history of this young country.
