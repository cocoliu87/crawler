Thanks. Archived discussion for April 2007 from Wikipedia:In the news section on the Main Page/Candidates. April 30 Israeli PM Ehud Olmert is criticised in a high-level report for taking Israel to war in Lebanon last year "hastily". (BBC) ابو علي (Abu Ali) 20:25, 30 April 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I'd wait till the report of the Winograd Commission is officially released and see what impacts it has on the Olmert government, e.g. some high profile politician losing his job, etc. --PFHLai 23:47, 30 April 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] The interim-report is an official release of the commission. I think that's official enough. The researched subject (the war) is notable, the people involved are notable, etc. I suggest: "The Winograd Commission criticizes Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Defense Minister Amir Peretz of Israel of mishandling the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict." AecisBrievenbus 23:58, 30 April 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] How is this news? Every head of state/government gets criticized, anyway. --Howard the Duck 03:34, 1 May 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] This was a government-appointed commission of inquiry, not just another individual on the street. AecisBrievenbus 10:17, 1 May 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] The Blue Ribbon Committee does this all of the time, isn't it? Is this an equivalent? --Howard the Duck 11:15, 1 May 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] However government appointed commission of inquiries criticisng a government isn't that uncommon. Perhaps the key thing here is that this criticism is particular strong and what the criticism is about is more serious then your ordinary 'run of the mill' thing but I'm still not convinced it's enough to merit ITN in the absense of further events (ministers resigning, government collapsing etc) Nil Einne 11:43, 1 May 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] What is remarkable/striking/notable is that the Winograd Commission was called into being to review/analyse this particular war. This particular report was/is its raison d'être. AecisBrievenbus 10:20, 2 May 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] That preliminary report was indeed official. Right. I missed that final sentence. The Winograd Commission article currently has more on the leaked versions reported on TV than the official one. Olmert's response and Eitan Cabel quitting are also missing from the article. --PFHLai 17:08, 1 May 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] This is more than just routine criticism. Both Olmert and Peretz may be forced to resign in the coming hours (see [www.haaretz.com]). Yes the article needs a fair bit of work. Several thousand Students are blocking Tel Aviv streets right now. Much larger demonstrations calling for Olmerts resignation are sceduled for tomorrow evening. Yes the article needs a fair bit of work. ابو علي (Abu Ali) 12:55, 2 May 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I thought the students in Tel Aviv were protesting against proposed education reforms. More to the story? Please add to the article as appropriate. --PFHLai 04:51, 3 May 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] There's a mass demonstration in Tel Aviv tonight, see [1]. AecisBrievenbus 20:47, 3 May 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Ehud Olmert I've added the protests (the real one at Rabin Square, not the one on campus) to Portal: Current events. The 'Winograd Commission' article, too, but I kept it brief. Please elaborate as necessary. The Winograd Commission criticizes the Isreali government of mishandling the 2006 Lebanon War, prompting mass protests in Tel Aviv and calls for Prime Minister Ehud Olmert (pictured) (and Defense Minister Amir Peretz) to resign. Is this too long and complicated ? --PFHLai 05:09, 4 May 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] What if we leave the mass protests aside - they take up much ITN space - and post the blurb: "The Winograd Commission criticizes the Israeli government of mishandling the 2006 Lebanon War, prompting calls for Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Defense Minister Amir Peretz to resign." AecisBrievenbus 21:27, 4 May 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Posted. I think a mention of the protest is needed. IMO, the involvement of the public in the protest makes this a remarkable, significant event. If it's just politicians yapping at each other, it's boring and not ITN-worthy. Yes, the line is somewhat long, but not as long as the line about the UK elections at the top of ITN right now. --PFHLai 06:03, 5 May 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Operation Crevice has resulted in the conviction of five british al-qaeda memebers for plannning bombings after the longest trial in British legal history. This also has links to 7 July 2005 London bombings. I think this should be on the front page, what do others think. Hypnosadist 19:11, 30 April 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I don't see referenced info on the 5 convicts being al-qaeda members or about the trial being "the longest trial in British legal history." Please add them to the article. Please also cleanup the article so that it doesn't read like a timeline. Thanks. --PFHLai 23:45, 30 April 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] It is referenced that they got there instructions from al qaeda leaders in pakistan, and the trial section reads like a timeline because it was an On-going trial until this morning.Hypnosadist 00:17, 1 May 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] There's a difference between getting instructions from Al Qaeda leaders (i.e. being an Al Qaeda operative) and being an actual member of the Al Qaeda organisation. AecisBrievenbus 00:27, 1 May 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] No there isn't, but an argument about if they had al qaeda decoder rings can and should be had on the talk page of the article, not here. This is about if the news story leading across britain and europe linked to a pre-existing article should go into ITN. Hypnosadist 01:07, 1 May 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] The discussion about their relation to Al Qaeda should be held here as well, because it would affect the wording of the blurb, if this is put up. AecisBrievenbus 10:15, 1 May 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Then change it to al qaeda ordered or al qaeda supported. Hypnosadist 11:26, 1 May 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Let's keep things simple: Five men arrested in Operation Crevice in 2004 are convicted of plotting to deploy fertilizer bombs in terrorist attacks across the United Kingdom. This trial appears to a prominent courtcase, and a worthy candidate for ITN. More updating to the article and a little cleanup would make it a stronger candidate. --PFHLai 17:50, 1 May 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] This wording is fine by me. Hypnosadist 09:29, 2 May 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Posted. AecisBrievenbus 13:41, 3 May 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] April 29 Long-term Croatian politician Ivica Račan, former President in Communist era and first pro-European democratic Prime Minister of Croatia, founder and sole leader of the Social Democratic Party of Croatia, dies of cancer --PaxEquilibrium 19:27, 29 April 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] See criteria 5 above. --Monotonehell 23:14, 29 April 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] It does fulfill 5-2. --PaxEquilibrium 16:55, 30 April 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] This one took me a while to decide. Račan was the immediate past PM, and practically the leader of the opposition until his sudden resignation. With an election coming up in a few months, he might become PM again. This is an "almost pass" for criterion 5-1. He only resigned recently and died soon afterwards, this counts as "unexpected" to me, even though the death took weeks. (Sigh... poor guy...) That's a "pass" for criterion 5-2. When it comes to major international impact or interest for criteria 3 & 5-3, well, I'm still waiting for this to appear on BBC online news, etc. If the world eulogizes Račan as one of the leaders who led Croatia out of Yugoslavia (he was the guy who told Milošević off in 1990???), like Franjo Tuđman, then we may have a stronger candidate. I have to decline for now. Maybe someone else more familiar with Croatian history and politics can look into this. BTW, the suggested headline is longer (and more informative!) than the current lead paragraph in Račan wikibio. A more concise headline would be preferable. Thanks. --PFHLai 06:01, 30 April 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] How about this: Ivica Račan, the previous Prime Minister of Croatia, dies of kidney cancer weeks after his resignation as leader of the opposition Social Democratic Party. --PFHLai 17:01, 1 May 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Could contain more information on him (he's the greatest modern Croatian politician), but it's OK, yeah. --PaxEquilibrium Posted. Let's not put POVs on MainPage. --PFHLai 04:45, 2 May 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Mstislav Rostropovich in 1978 Russian cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich dies at age 80 and is buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery after a funeral attended by international dignitaries and thousands of mourners. Rostropovich's biography in wikipedia now has a new section on his illness and death. There should be adequate updating. --74.13.125.30 15:46, 30 April 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Thank you for the updating. Please also address criterion 5. An old person dying of old age shouldn't be considered as unexpected. If Rostropovich was still active last year, jetting around to perform (or to drum up funding for his charity to buy vaccines for Azerbaijani kids), but suddenly fell ill a few weeks ago, then the death last week might be counted as unexpected. Is this what happened ? The article doesn't have much on Rostropovich's latest activities prior to his hospitalization, suggesting that he had been inactive. --PFHLai 23:55, 30 April 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Major League Baseball pitcher Josh Hancock dies in an automobile accident in St. Louis. Should be included, as he is a player in a league followed worldwide. --CFIF ☎ ⋐ 16:33, 29 April 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] See criteria 5 above. --Monotonehell 16:57, 29 April 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Could you please elaborate why you think this qualifies or doesn't qualify?
