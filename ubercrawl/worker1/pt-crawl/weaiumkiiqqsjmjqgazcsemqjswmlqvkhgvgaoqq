The Redbacks play their home matches at Adelaide Oval and Karen Rolton Oval, they are the state cricket team for South Australia representing the state in the Sheffield Shield competition and the limited overs Marsh One-Day Cup. Their Marsh One-Day Cup uniform features a red body with black sleeves. They are known as the West End Redbacks due to a sponsorship agreement with West End. The Redbacks formerly competed in the now-defunct KFC Twenty20 Big Bash, but were succeeded by the Adelaide Strikers in 2011 because this league was replaced with the Big Bash League.[2] History[edit] This section needs additional citations for verification.

(November 2017) (template removal help) The earliest known first-class match played by South Australia took place against Tasmania on the Adelaide Oval in November 1877.[3] In 1892–93, they joined New South Wales and Victoria and played the inaugural Sheffield Shield season. South Australia won the Shield in just their second attempt. They have won the competition 13 times in total while they have twice won the One Day tournament now known as the Ryobi One Day Cup. They are also the current holders of the KFC 20/20 Big Bash trophy, defeating NSW in the 2010/11 final at Adelaide Oval. They will continue to hold the KFC Twenty20 Big Bash trophy, as the league is now defunct and has been replaced by the Big Bash League. Over the years, many successful international cricketers have played for South Australia. Clarrie Grimmett played with them during the 1920s and '30s, taking a total of 668 wickets. This remains a state record. In 1934, Sir Donald Bradman moved to South Australia and joined the team after originally playing with New South Wales, and he started with scores of 117, 233 and 357 in his first three innings. Others include the Chappell brothers (Ian and Greg), David Hookes, Darren Lehmann, Gil Langley, Jason Gillespie, and Terry Jenner. South Australia has also imported cricketers to play for them, with the most famous being Sir Gary Sobers, who appeared in three seasons during the early 1960s, and Barry Richards. Richards played just one season with South Australia but managed to set a state record for most runs in a season, making 1101 runs in the 1970–71 season.[4] Honours[edit] Mark Cosgrove wearing South Australia's training gear Sheffield Shield (13) 1893–94 1909–10 1912–13 1926–27 1935–36 1938–39 1952–53 1963–64 1968–69 1970–71 1975–76 1981–82 1995–96 One-day Cups (3) 1983–84 1986–87 2011–12 KFC Twenty20 Big Bash/Big Bash League (1) 2010–11 First-class records[edit] Most runs for South Australia[5] Name Seasons Matches Inns NO Runs HS Ave 100 50 0 Darren Lehmann 1987–2007 119 218 14 11622 301* 56.97 39 41 14 Greg Blewett 1991–2006 117 223 13 9682 268 46.10 23 48 15 David Hookes 1975–1992 120 205 9 9364 306* 47.77 26 44 14 Callum Ferguson 2004–2020 124 235 17 8318 213 38.15 19 42 23 Les Favell 1951–1970 121 220 4 8269 164 38.28 20 43 18 Ian Chappell 1962–1980 89 157 13 7665 205* 53.22 22 45 9 Neil Dansie 1950–1967 107 196 6 6692 185 35.22 17 32 9 Andrew Hilditch 1982–1992 91 161 11 6504 230 43.36 17 32 10 Travis Head 2012–present 89 165 5 6282 223 39.26 13 37 17 George Giffen Highest individual score: Don Bradman 369 vs Tasmania in 1935/36 Most centuries: Darren Lehmann 39 Most runs in a season: Michael Klinger 1203 runs in 2008/09 Highest partnership: David Hookes and Wayne Phillips 462* vs Tasmania in 1986/87 Highest team score: 821-7d vs Queensland in 1939/40 Most wickets for South Australia[6] Player Wickets Seasons Clarrie Grimmett 504 1924/25 – 1940/41 Ashley Mallett 344 1967/68 – 1980/81 Chadd Sayers 279 2010/11 – 2020/21 Tim May 270 1984/85 – 1995/96 Joe Mennie 256 2011/12 – 2020/21 Most wickets in a season: Shaun Tait 65 Most wickets in an innings: Tim Wall 10/36 vs NSW in 1932/33 Most wickets in a match: George Giffen 17/201 vs Victoria in 1885/86 Squad[edit] Players with international caps are listed in bold.[7] No. Name Nat Birth date Batting style Bowling style Notes Batters 20 Kelvin Smith (1994-09-15) 15 September 1994 (age 29) Left-handed Right-arm off break 22 Henry Hunt (1997-01-07) 7 January 1997 (age 26) Right-handed — 23 Jake Fraser-McGurk (2002-04-11) 11 April 2002 (age 21) Right-handed Right-arm leg spin 26 Jake Carder (1995-12-11) 11 December 1995 (age 27) Left-handed Right-arm medium 31 Thomas Kelly (2000-12-14) 14 December 2000 (age 22) Right-handed — 33 Jake Lehmann (1992-07-08) 8 July 1992 (age 31) Left-handed Slow left-arm orthodox 34 Travis Head (1993-12-29) 29 December 1993 (age 29) Left-handed Right-arm off break Cricket Australia contract Captain 47 Daniel Drew (1996-05-22) 22 May 1996 (age 27) Right-handed — - Isaac Higgins (2002-09-08) 8 September 2002 (age 21) Right-handed — Rookie contract - Kyle Brazell — Left-handed — Rookie contract All-rounders 6 Liam Scott (2000-12-12) 12 December 2000 (age 22) Right-handed Right-arm fast-medium 38 Nathan McSweeney (1999-03-08) 8 March 1999 (age 24) Right-handed Right-arm off break - Aidan Cahill (2003-03-20) 20 March 2003 (age 20) Right-handed Right-arm medium-fast Rookie contract Wicket-keepers 4 Harry Nielsen (1995-05-03) 3 May 1995 (age 28) Left-handed — 5 Alex Carey (1991-08-27) 27 August 1991 (age 32) Left-handed — Cricket Australia contract Vice Captain - Harry Matthias (2003-06-25) 25 June 2003 (age 20) Right-handed — Rookie contract Pace Bowlers 0 Nathan McAndrew (1993-07-14) 14 July 1993 (age 30) Right-handed Right-arm medium-fast 9 Wes Agar (1997-02-05) 5 February 1997 (age 26) Right-handed Right-arm fast 13 Harry Conway (1992-09-17) 17 September 1992 (age 31) Right-handed Right-arm fast-medium 14 David Grant (1997-03-24) 24 March 1997 (age 26) Right-handed Right-arm medium-fast 21 Jordan Buckingham (2000-03-17) 17 March 2000 (age 23) Left-handed Right-arm fast-medium 35 Brendan Doggett (1994-04-03) 3 April 1994 (age 29) Right-handed Right-arm fast-medium 58 Henry Thornton (1996-12-13) 13 December 1996 (age 26) Right-handed Right-arm fast-medium 45 Spencer Johnson (1995-12-16) 16 December 1995 (age 27) Left-handed Left-arm fast-medium Spin Bowlers 24 Lloyd Pope (1999-12-01) 1 December 1999 (age 23) Right-handed Right-arm leg break 46 Ben Manenti (1997-03-23) 23 March 1997 (age 26) Right-handed Right-arm off break See also[edit] List of South Australian representative cricketers References[edit] ^ Government of South Australia (2013), Adelaide Oval Redevelopment Archived 13 March 2019 at the Wayback Machine, Department of Planning, Transport & Infrastructure, retrieved 14 September 2013 ^ "Index of /". www.bigbashleague.com.au.
