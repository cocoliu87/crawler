This allows users to maintain a consistent identity throughout Wikimedia and work on different projects without having to sign up and log in to each project individually. This does not apply to Wikitech as it requires a new account. For information about unified login, see m:Help:Unified login To request a rename of your global account, see Special:GlobalRenameRequest To view your global account's contributions, see Special:CentralAuth See also[edit] m:Help:Unified login Single-User Login provides access to all wikis, an April 2015 entry on the Wikimedia Foundation blog mw:SUL finalisation (an inactive MediaWiki page, kept for historical interest, on the 2015 rationalization of usernames across all WMF wikis) Wikipedia:Changing username/Guidelines § Handling SUL conflicts Wikipedia:SUL/Consultation on renames (an inactive Wikipedia sub-page, kept for historical interest, on a discussion from 2008) v t e Wikipedia accounts and governance Unregistered (IP) users Why create an account?
