Throughout the conflict, RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan "Hemedti" Dagalo and Sudan's de facto leader and army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan have disputed control of government sites in Khartoum, including the general military headquarters, the Presidential Palace, Khartoum International Airport, Burhan's official residence, and the SNBC headquarters, as well as states and towns in Darfur and Kordofan. The two sides were then joined by rebel groups who had previously fought against the two sides. Starting in June, the SPLM-N (al-Hilu) attacked army positions in the south of the country.[13][14] In July, a faction of the Sudan Liberation Movement led by Mustafa Tambour (SLM-T) officially joined the war in support of the SAF,[2] while in August, the rebel Tamazuj movement based in Darfur and Kordofan joined forces with the RSF.[30] In November, the largest SLM faction, led by Minni Minawi (SLM-MM), declared war on the RSF, alongside the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM).[31] Background[edit] Main article: History of Sudan The history of conflicts in Sudan has consisted of foreign invasions and resistance, ethnic tensions, religious disputes, and disputes over resources.[32][33] Two civil wars between the central government and the southern regions killed 1.5 million people, and a conflict in the western region of Darfur displaced two million people and killed more than 200,000 others.[34] Since independence in 1956, Sudan has experienced more than 15 military coups[35] and it has been ruled by the military for the majority of that time, interspersed with periods of democratic parliamentary rule.[36][37] War in Darfur and the formation of the RSF[edit] By the turn of the 21st century, Sudan's western Darfur region had endured prolonged instability and social strife due to a combination of racial and ethnic tensions and disputes over land and water. In 2003, this situation erupted into a full-scale rebellion against government rule, against which president and military strongman Omar al-Bashir vowed to use forceful action. The resulting War in Darfur was marked by widespread state-sponsored acts of violence, leading to charges of war crimes and genocide against al-Bashir.[38] The initial phase of the conflict left approximately 300,000 dead and 2.7 million were forcibly displaced; even though the intensity of the violence later declined, the situation in the region remained far from peaceful.[39] To crush uprisings by non-Arab tribes in the Nuba Mountains, al-Bashir relied upon the Janjaweed, a collection of Arab militias which was drawn from camel-trading tribes which were active in Darfur and portions of Chad. In 2013, al-Bashir announced that the Janjaweed would be reorganized as the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and he also announced that the RSF would be placed under the command of the Janjaweed's commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, more commonly known as Hemedti.[40][41][42][43] The RSF perpetrated mass killings, mass rapes, pillage, torture, and destruction of villages and were accused of committing ethnic cleansing against the Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa.[42] Leaders of the RSF have been indicted for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court (ICC),[44] but Hemedti was not personally implicated in the 2003–2004 atrocities.[39] In 2017, a new law gave the RSF the status of an "independent security force".[42] Hemedti received several gold mines in Darfur as patronage from al-Bashir, and his personal wealth grew substantially.[44][43] Bashir sent RSF forces to quash a 2013 uprising in South Darfur and deployed RSF units to fight in Yemen and Libya.[41] During this time, the RSF developed a working relationship with the Russian private military outfit Wagner Group.[45] These developments ensured that RSF forces grew into the tens of thousands and came to possess thousands of armed pickup trucks which regularly patrolled the streets of Khartoum.[45] The Bashir regime allowed the RSF and other armed groups to proliferate to prevent threats to its security from within the armed forces, a practice known as "coup-proofing".[46] Political transition[edit] Main article: Sudanese transition to democracy Chairman of the Transitional Sovereignty Council, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. Commander of the Rapid Support Forces, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo. In December 2018, protests against al-Bashir's regime began, starting the first phase of the Sudanese Revolution. Eight months of sustained civil disobedience were met with violent repression.[47] In April 2019, the military (including the RSF) ousted al-Bashir in a coup d'état, ending his three decades of rule; the army established the Transitional Military Council, a junta.[47][44][43] Bashir was imprisoned in Khartoum; he was not turned over to the ICC, which had issued warrants for his arrest on charges of war crimes.[48] Protests calling for civilian rule continued; in June 2019, the RSF perpetrated the Khartoum massacre, in which more than a hundred demonstrators were killed[47][43][41] and dozens were raped.[41] Hemedti denied orchestrating the attack.[43] In August 2019, in response to international pressure and mediation by the African Union and Ethiopia, the military agreed to share power in an interim joint civilian-military unity government (the Transitional Sovereignty Council), headed by a civilian Prime Minister, Abdalla Hamdok, with elections to be held in 2023.[38][47] In October 2021, the military seized power in a coup led by Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Hemedti. The Transitional Sovereignty Council was reconstituted as a new military junta led by Al-Burhan, monopolizing power[49] and halting Sudan's transition to democracy.[48] Origins of the SPLM-N and the SLM[edit] The SPLM-N was founded by units of the predominantly South Sudanese Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army stationed in areas that remained in Sudan following the South Sudanese vote for independence in 2011[50] who then led a rebellion in the southern states of South Kordofan and Blue Nile a few months later. In 2017, the SPLM-N split between a faction led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu and one led by Malik Agar, with al-Hilu demanding secularism as a condition for peace while Agar did not agree with this.[51] During the Sudanese Revolution, al-Hilu's faction declared an indefinite unilateral ceasefire.[52] In 2020, a peace agreement was signed between the Sudanese government and Agar's faction,[53] with Agar later joining the Transitional Sovereignty Council in Khartoum. Al-Hilu held out until he agreed to sign a separate peace agreement with the Sudanese government a few months after.[54] Further steps to consolidate the agreement stalled following the 2021 coup,[55] contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 53 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/War_in_Sudan_(2023) responseCode 3 200
