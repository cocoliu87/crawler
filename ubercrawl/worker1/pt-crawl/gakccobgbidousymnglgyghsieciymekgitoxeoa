Featured articles are considered to be some of the best articles Wikipedia has to offer, as determined by Wikipedia's editors. They are used by editors as examples for writing other articles. Before being listed here, articles are reviewed as featured article candidates for accuracy, neutrality, completeness, and style according to our featured article criteria. Many featured articles were previously good articles (which are reviewed with a less restrictive set of criteria). There are 6,405 featured articles out of 6,748,012 articles on the English Wikipedia (about 0.09% or one out of every 1,050 articles). Articles that no longer meet the criteria can be proposed for improvement or removal at featured article review. On non-mobile versions of our website, a small bronze star icon () on the top right corner of an article's page indicates that the article is featured. On most smartphones and tablets you can also select "Desktop" at the very bottom of the page or "Request Desktop Site" in your browser's menu to see this line (do a search to find out how). Additionally, if the current article is featured in another language, a star will appear next to the corresponding entry in the language switcher to let you know.
