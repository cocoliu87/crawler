See if anything from Italian page can be used to improve this one. Consider implementing any suggestions made by the most recent peer review, including the automated peer-review suggestions. Implement suggestions made by the 2012 Peer Review. Improve/Add Citations Fix the problems that were found in the 2012 FAC Add demographic information from pew report [1] Stylistic problems, specifically: ...the single-sentence paragraphs, the lack of flow within paragraphs, the broken connections between paragraphs, the weak large-scale architecture in the article, the huge number of references for a paltry amount of data, the lack of distinction between important and trivial facts. Record a new audio file once it reaches FA standard Other: Is it worth having an FAQ like other heavy traffic articles? E.g. "Why should Wikipedia have an article on itself?" The "sub-articles" that were split off from this article are badly in need of attention, as are several other related articles. The following all need work: Reliability of Wikipedia Criticism of Wikipedia Wikipedia in popular culture History of Wikipedia — this one in particular is missing information and should be reorganized Can we get the first three of these into a template somehow? Many other language Wikipedia articles of questionable notability, particularly the smallest ones. A thorough going through is needed, with non-notable articles being AFD material. Images: update graph in history section Here are some tasks awaiting attention: Expand : Add information about how well the open model is working. The number of articles protected and its evolution in time. Even better, share of reads (hits) according to page protection status.
