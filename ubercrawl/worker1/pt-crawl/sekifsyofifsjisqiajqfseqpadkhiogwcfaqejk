It saw fighting between the Russian Armed Forces (alongside the Donetsk People's Republic People's Militia) and the Ukrainian Armed Forces for control over Mariupol. Lasting for almost three months, the siege ended in a victory for Russia and the Donetsk People's Republic, as Ukraine lost control of the city amidst Russia's eastern Ukraine offensive and southern Ukraine offensive; all Ukrainian troops remaining in the city surrendered at the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works on 20 May 2022,[46][47] after they were ordered to cease fighting.[48][49][21][50] Mariupol is located in Ukraine's Donetsk Oblast, and following the siege, it was initially controlled by the Donetsk People's Republic, supported by occupying Russian troops. However, it was later subjected to Russia's unilateral annexation of southeastern Ukraine, and remains under direct Russian control as of 10 May 2023[update]. During the Russian siege, the Red Cross described the situation in Mariupol as "apocalyptic" while Ukrainian authorities accused Russia of engineering a major humanitarian crisis in the city.[51][52] Ukrainian officials reported that approximately 25,000 civilians had been killed[44] and that at least 95% of the city had been destroyed during the fighting, primarily by large-scale Russian bombardments.[53] In an official statement, the United Nations confirmed the deaths of 1,348 civilians in Mariupol, but warned that the true death toll was likely thousands higher while also reporting that 90% of the city's residential buildings had been damaged or completely destroyed.[40][41][42] Major combat operations in the city effectively ended on 16 May 2022 after Ukraine's Azov Regiment surrendered at the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works.[1][54][55][56][57][47] Some Western reports described the siege as a pyrrhic[58][59] or symbolic[60] Russian victory, with others noting that the humanitarian impact of the takeover was a "reputational disaster" for Russia.[61] However, the loss of the city has also been seen as a significant defeat for Ukraine.[62] Background Main articles: Battle of Mariupol (2014), Offensive on Mariupol (September 2014), and Shyrokyne standoff See also: War in Donbas (2014–2022) and January 2015 Mariupol rocket attack Mariupol was considered a major strategic city and therefore was a target for Russian forces. It was the largest city in the Ukrainian-controlled portion of Donetsk Oblast,[e][63] and was also one of the largest Russian-speaking cities in Ukraine.[63] Mariupol was a major industrial hub, home of the Illich and Azovstal Iron and Steel Works, and the largest city on the Sea of Azov.[64] Control of its port on the western shore of the Sea of Azov is vital to the economy of Ukraine. For Russia, it would allow a land route to Crimea and allow passage by Russian marine traffic.[65] Capturing the city gave Russia full control over the Sea of Azov.[66] In 2014 after the Revolution of Dignity, Mariupol was swept by pro-Russian protests against the new government. Tensions erupted into the war in Donbas in early May, and during the unrest, militiamen of the separatist and Russian-backed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) took control of the city and forced Ukrainian troops to abandon it during the first battle for Mariupol.[67] However, the following month, Ukrainian forces recaptured the city in an offensive.[68] In August, the DPR and Russian troops captured the village of Novoazovsk, 45 km east of Mariupol near the Russo-Ukrainian border.[69] With the town captured and forces renewed, in September the DPR attempted to capture the city again in the second battle for Mariupol. Fighting reached the eastern outskirts, but the separatists were eventually repelled.[70] In October, then-DPR Prime Minister Alexander Zakharchenko vowed to retake the city.[71] Mariupol was then indiscriminately bombed by rockets in January 2015. Fearing a future third offensive into Mariupol, in February Ukrainian forces launched a surprise attack into Shyrokyne, a village located 11 km east of Mariupol with the objective of expelling the separatist forces from the city limits and creating a buffer zone.[72][73] The separatists withdrew from Shyrokyne four months later.[74] The conflict was frozen when the Minsk II ceasefire agreement was signed in 2015.[75] 2018 saw again tension in the region around Mariupol, as the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) coast guard fired upon and captured three Ukrainian Navy vessels after they attempted to transit from the Black Sea into the Sea of Azov through the Kerch Strait on their way to the port of Mariupol. The Kerch Strait incident raised tensions, and martial law was briefly declared by Ukraine in fears that a war would break out between the two countries.[76] One of the most instrumental groups for the recapture and subsequent defenses of Mariupol was the Azov Battalion, a Ukrainian volunteer militia, controversial for its openly neo-Nazi and ultranationalist members.[77][78][79] By November 2014 Azov was integrated into the National Guard of Ukraine, with Mariupol as its headquarters.[80] As one of Vladimir Putin's stated goals for the invasion was the "denazification" of Ukrai contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 51 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Siege_of_Mariupol responseCode 3 200
