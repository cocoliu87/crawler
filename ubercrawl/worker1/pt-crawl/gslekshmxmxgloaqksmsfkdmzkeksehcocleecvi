While mining for jade in Kachin State, he recruited disaffected Arakanese Buddhists to his insurgent group.[5] He was one of twenty-six men to form the Arakan Army with support from the Kachin Independence Army. In June 2022, military spokespeople from the State Administration Council said that provocative rhetoric from Twan Mrat Naing as the leader of the Arakan Army was inviting conflict.[6] The informal ceasefire between AA and the junta would breakdown after an junta airstike on an AA base in Kayin State.[7] Arrests by the Myanmar government[edit] On 10 July 2019, Aung Mrat Kyaw, Twan Mrat Naing's younger brother, along with five Arakanese were detained by the Singaporean government and deported to Myanmar, where they were arrested shortly after arriving. Singapore's home ministry said they had organized and mobilized some members of the Myanmar community in Singapore to support the Arakan Army, and its political wing, the United League of Arakan.[8][9] On 18 October 2019, the younger sister of Twan Mrat Naing, Moe Hnin Phyu and her husband, Kyaw Naing, were arrested at the Yangon International Airport after they returned from Chiang Mai, Thailand and are currently being questioned.

On 6 December 2019, Twan Mrat Naing's wife Hnin Zar Phyu and her two children were detained by Thai immigration officials in Chiang Mai, when she went there to extend her visa.[10] The Chiang Mai office of the Thailand Immigration Bureau arrested her due to the presence of her name on the list of people affiliated with the Arakan Army, which was provided by the Myanmar government. On 25 February 2020, the detained family left for Switzerland under the political asylum initiated by the UNHCR.[11][12] On 9 June 2021, Aung Myat Kyaw, Moe Hnin Phyu and her husband were released from prison after all charges against them were dropped.
