When fully completed, the sixth line on the country's MRT network will serve 32 stations over 43 kilometres (27 mi) in length, becoming one of the world's longest driverless rapid transit lines. It runs along a combined north–south and east–west corridor, starting in the north at Woodlands town, passing through Upper Thomson and the towns of Ang Mo Kio and Bishan, heading south to the city-centre at Orchard Road and Marina Bay, subsequently heading eastwards along the eastern coast of the country through Kallang, Marine Parade and southern Bedok before ending at Upper East Coast. The line was first announced by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) on 15 August 2014, merging the previously planned and distinct Thomson (TSL) and Eastern Region (ERL) lines. By then, construction of the TSL had already begun in January 2014. The line is being opened in stages, beginning with Stage 1[b] on 31 January 2020. Stage 2[c] opened on 28 August 2021 and Stage 3[d] opened on 13 November 2022. Stage 4[e] and Stage 5[f] are scheduled to open sometime in 2024 and 2025 respectively. Meanwhile, Mount Pleasant and Marina South stations, which were structurally completed as part of Stage 3, remains non-operational due to the perceived lack of developments in the area at this given time. In January 2019, an infill station known as Founders' Memorial was announced to complement its namesake, with the LTA additionally considering to integrate the Changi Airport Branch that is currently a part of the East West Line (EWL) into the TEL. When fully opened, it is expected to serve about 500,000 commuters daily in the initial years before rising to one million in the long-term. It is the fourth MRT line to be operated by SMRT Trains Ltd and also the fourth to be completely automated and driverless. The line is currently served by Mandai Depot, with the East Coast Integrated Depot opening in 2025, and services are operated by the T251 electric multiple unit (EMU) rolling stock manufuactured by Kawasaki–CRRC.[6] New and improved signage was introduced to all stations along the TEL, which saw less text and wordiness in place of more illustrations and visualisations. Moreover, ever since the TEL began operations, all the other MRT lines on the wider network have since been represented by their initials in addition to the exits being represented numerically rather than alphabetically.[7] History[edit] Thomson Line[edit] Construction of TEL's Woodlands station in 2017 The Thomson Line (TSL) was first announced on 25 January 2008. Several architectural and engineering consultancy packages were released in 2010 which indicated an increase in the number of stations from 18 in the initial announcement to the current 22 and length of the line from 27 to 30 km (17 to 19 mi).[8] On 16 June 2011, LTA announced the location of the depot for the line, which was due to begin construction at the end of 2012. It also announced Woodlands as an interchange with the existing North South Line and an additional station located near to Republic Polytechnic.[9] On 29 August 2012, it was announced that the completion of the TSL was pushed back to 2019 onwards instead of the indicative timeline of 2018 announced in the Land Transport Masterplan.[10] Construction of the TSL began in January 2014.[11] The groundbreaking ceremony took place on 27 June that year at Woodlands. All the working station names were confirmed as the final names except for Sin Ming station which was changed to Bright Hill.[12] Eastern Region Line[edit] Construction site of Marine Parade station in 2022 The Eastern Region Line (ERL) was first announced on 23 October 2001.[13] In its preliminary plans, ERL was to have been a 40 kilometre rectangular loop that would complement the existing East West line and enhance inter- and intra-town travelling in the eastern region. It would have looped around the Jalan Besar and East Coast areas, intersecting the Circle Line and other lines along the way, benefiting residents in Tampines, Bedok, Marine Parade, MacPherson and Kaki Bukit.[14] The northern part of the Eastern Region Line became the third stage of the Downtown Line. The southern part of the Eastern Region Line became the East Coast stretch of the Thomson-East Coast line. Sungei Bedok would become an interchange between the Downtown and the Thomson-East Coast lines. On 11 July 2012, Josephine Teo, Minister of State, Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Transport, announced that the Land Transport Authority is starting architectural and engineering consultancy studies for the Eastern Region Line, which will eventually connect to the Thomson Line.[15] The director of rail services from LTA, Melvyn Thong, said on 29 May 2013 at the Modern Railways conference that there are plans to extend the Eastern Region Line to the future Changi Airport Terminal 4 which was at that time, set to be ready by 2017[16] but on 1 June that year, the Land Transport Authority clarified that the Eastern Region Line will not provide an MRT link to the planned Terminal 4.[17] On 30 August that year, Minister of State for Transport Josephine Teo unveiled plans that it will be linked to the future Changi Airport Terminal 5, a mega terminal, which will be the largest terminal in Singapore upon completion in the 2030s.[18] Merging of Eastern Region Line and Thomson Line[edit] The Eastern Region Line was merged with the Thomson Line on 15 August 2014 to form the Thomson–East Coast Line, extending the project from three to five stages, with nine more stations.[5] The groundbreaking ceremony for the East Coast stretch took place at Marine Parade on 21 July 2016. All the working station names, including Xilin on the Downtown Line extension, were confirmed as the final names except for Amber station which was changed to Tanjong Katong. The authorities are also considering extending the Thomson–East Coast line to all terminals at Changi Airport, including the upcoming Terminal 5, announced Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan.[19][20] Line operations[edit] SMRT Trains Ltd was appointed as the operator of the line on 15 September 2017.[21] On 28 August 2019, the Land Transport Authority awarded several non-fare businesses along the line, with Asiaray Connect awarded an advertising contract and a consortium, made up of SMRT Experience, JR Business Development SEA and Alphaplus Investments appointed to run retail space. This is the first time the LTA outsourced these non-fare businesses.[22] On 19 September that year, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan revealed that the opening of the first stage of the Thomson–East Coast Line from Woodlands North to Woodlands South stations was delayed to January 2020 from the indicative time of 2019 announced earlier,[23] subsequently confirmed as 31 January 2020. Self-assistance kiosks were installed at all TEL MRT stations and will be rolled out to all stations.[24][25] On 11 January 2020, SMRT and LTA hosted an open house for the first stage of the line, with the stage opening for revenue service on 31 January 2020.[26] The opening of the second stage was initially delayed to the first quarter of 2021 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic circuit breaker period; the project was su contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 69 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Thomson%E2%80%93East_Coast_MRT_line responseCode 3 200
