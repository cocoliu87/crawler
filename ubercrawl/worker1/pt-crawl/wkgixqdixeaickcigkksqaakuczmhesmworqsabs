December 31 A 'bomb explodes at Barajas International Airport in Madrid, with ETA claiming responsibility, terminating a 7-month ceasefire. Mostlyharmless 07:07, 31 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Already posted (not by me). --PFHLai 15:19, 31 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] A series of explosions kills two and injures dozens in Bangkok, Thailand. --PFHLai Added, although 2006 Bangkok bombings is a more fully-developed article. -- tariqabjotu 21:58, 31 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] December 30 Nepal adopts a new national coat of arm as a gesture of reconciliation after the Nepalese Civil War. -- PFHLai 20:37, 30 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Posted. --PFHLai 00:17, 31 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] 29 December Collapse of the Ayles Ice Shelf A 25 square mile chunk of the Ayles Ice Shelf at Ellesmere Island was just discovered to have broken off of Canada.[1] --The lorax 22:52, 29 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Cool. Haven't had any environment-related news as far as I can remember. Should the headline mention that the giant "iceberg" poses a serious risk to oil platforms in its drift path ? (from CBC article) Is this too speculative ? BTW, next time pls post on Portal: Current events first. It's a prerequisite. (I've done it this time.) Please see guidelines at WP:ITNMP. --PFHLai 20:09, 30 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Would Ellesmere Island be a better article to feature (to get the link bolded) on ITN ? It's not a stub. --PFHLai 22:01, 30 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] How about this: The Ayles Ice Shelf at Ellesmere Island in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago is found have collapsed, setting a 66 km² (25 mi²) portion adrift in the Arctic Ocean. --PFHLai 00:15, 31 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Posted. --PFHLai 02:50, 31 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Removed by another admin in less than 5 minutes. --PFHLai 03:28, 31 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] That admin was wrong to say "There is nothing whatsoever in the article about this" - the article does cover the event, but rather confusingly the event happened in August 2005 and has only just been 'discovered'. It is also a rather slow event. The large (and large here means large!) bit of ice will drift around, freezing into the sea ice in winter, and (from one of the sources): "Prevailing winds could then send the ice island southwards, deep into the Beaufort Sea. "Over the next few years this ice island could drift into populated shipping routes," Ms. Weir said. "There's significant oil and gas development in this region as well, so we'll have to keep monitoring its location over the next few years."" I would support restoring this item, with the wording: Scientists discover a 16-month-old collapse of the Ayles Ice Shelf at Ellesmere Island in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The resulting 66 km² (25 mi²) ice island in the Arctic Ocean may drift south in the spring and threaten shipping and oil platforms. The global warming link may be more controversial. Leave that in the article itself. The point here really, is that the news is the discovery, not the break-up (which happened in August 2005). Carcharoth 04:33, 31 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] It's now nominated by another admin for DYK. (IMO, this qualify for both DYK & ITN, but should not be used by both.) We'll likely see this on MainPage in a few days, anyway. --PFHLai 15:07, 31 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Saddam Hussein How about the Saddam Execution? Mientkiewicz5508 03:45, 29 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Wait till it actually happens. Rafy 08:16, 29 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Got the his headshot already uploaded and protected for tomorrow, just in case. --PFHLai 21:54, 29 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Execution set for some time before 9 PM CST...(6 AM Baghdad time) -- just under 3 hours from now. Wouldn't it be good to post something like "Former Iraqi Dictator Saddam Hussein awaits execution for the killing of..." however many blah blah in whatever year etc. etc. Something like that?-Mientkiewicz5508 00:10, 30 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Already posted (not by me). --PFHLai 19:31, 30 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] 28 December Flag of Somalia Leaders of the Islamic Courts Union resign as Ethiopian military units and forces of the Transitional Federal Government in Somalia besiege Mogadishu. [I'm waiting for pages like Hassan Aweys, Sharif Ahmed, etc., plus Portal:Current events, to get updated.] --PFHLai 09:59, 28 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Posted. --PFHLai 13:11, 28 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] UPDATED: Fighters of the Islamic Courts Union leave Mogadishu as Ethiopian-backed forces close in. --TheFEARgod (Ч) 12:14, 28 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] The fighters left ? The End of ICU rule in Mogadishu article says they gave up their weapons. --PFHLai 13:11, 28 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] please put the updated version because of: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6213499.stm --TheFEARgod (Ч) 14:34, 28 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Wikiarticles must be updated first, otherwise our MainPage would be a misrepresentation of our wikiarticles' content. --PFHLai 16:41, 28 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] 27 December Gerald Ford (pictured), the 38th President of the United States, dies on the 34th anniversary of Harry S. Truman's death. - User:Patricknoddy 8:54am December 27, 2006 (EST) I really don't think his death on the anniversary of Truman's death is that notable. It's more of a trivia fact. -- 68.37.247.142 13:48, 27 December 2006 (UTC) Kicking222 13:49, 27 December 2006 (UTC) (I wasn't signed in, for some reason.)Reply[reply] Already posted the night before, then briefly taken off ITN while admins sort things out.... -- PFHLai 17:08, 27 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Should not be there. He was a) not in power at the time of his death, b) not really sudden or tragic (being 93, and having health problems for the pas 3 years, according to the article), or c) is not having, and will lnot have a major impact on world events. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by 65.95.11.28 (talk) 03:19, 28 December 2006 (UTC).Reply[reply] Sorry, hit the wrong button, I am NOT saying he doesn't deserve to be included, but we can't just ignore the established criteris.`65.95.11.28 03:22, 28 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] IMO, the state funeral would qualify for (c). BTW, the criteria are currently being discussed on talk:ITN. The guidelines may be revamped. Former heads of state/govt may be included regardless (as long as their page is well updated). If anyone has any ideas how to make things work better, please join the discussion there. --PFHLai 04:52, 28 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Apple is under federal investigation for back-dating their stocks PCWorld - Schrandit 04:58, 28 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] And the article with the news updates would be ...? To just post a news headline, please go to Portal: Current events. Only those articles with good updates would get "promoted" from there to here, and then onto ITN. Please see ITN guidelines. Thanks. --PFHLai 05:14, 28 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] 26 December Ethiopian troops in Somalia capture Beledweyne, a town near the seat of the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia in Baidoa, from forces of the Islamic Courts Union. (Could someone more familiar with the Somali Civil War take a look at this article, please ? Thanks in advance.) --PFHLai 02:37, 27 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Posted, anyway, along with links to Battle of Jowhar & Battle of Bandiradley. -- PFHLai 17:33, 27 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] At least 200 people were killed as a result of a pipeline explosion in Lagos, Nigeria. Jacek Kendysz 18:21, 26 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] arg, this isn't the first time this has occurred this year and Wikipedia hasn't bothered to note it. the article's title is also ambiguous since another similar event happened in May.--gozar 18:39, 26 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Please, no ministubs for ITN. This should just be in Portal:Current events (I've just put a link there), then "promoted" to ITN when it becomes an article with reasonable coverage of the event. -- PFHLai 19:01, 26 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Now the 2006 Lagos pipeline explosion article has 130+ words. Referencing needs fixing, but I have to say the page has been greatly improved. BTW, gozar, you may want to voice your concerns at Talk:2006 Lagos pipeline explosion. -- PFHLai 02:57, 27 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Now we have a second stub on the same explosion in 2006 Abule Egba pipeline explosion. Let's not post this on ITN till we have a single non-stub article. --PFHLai 04:36, 28 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Merging complete. Posted. --PFHLai 02:46, 31 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] A 7.1 magnitude earthquake strikes south of Taiwan. — Preceding unsigned comment added by TheFEARgod (talk • contribs) Is there an updated article for this? Aecis Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984. 13:25, 26 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Let's wait till the 2006 Hengchun earthquake article mentions more about the damage and casualties, etc. Just saying "News agencies have aired reports of collapsed houses, hotel guests being trapped in elevators, and telephone outages due to severed lines." doesn't cut it, IMO. -- PFHLai 16:24, 26 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Despite the magnitude of the quake, this doesn't seem to be a major disaster afterall. --PFHLai 17:33, 27 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] I've added it due to the disruption of telecommunication services in parts of Asia. -- tariqabjotu 19:29, 27 December 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Good. I hadn't considered it from this angle till I saw the newscast. Glad it that already posted. --PFHLai 04:3 contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 80 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Wikipedia:In_the_news/Candidates/December_2006 responseCode 3 200
