It was founded at a conference between Rakhine insurgent groups in-exile in 2004,[1] and also has an armed wing in Kayin State, known as the Arakan Army.[2] Naing Soe, a senior leader of the ANC, was arrested in February 2018, following a series of bombings in Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine State.[3] He was later released after police failed to provide evidence linking him to the bombings within 30 days as is required by police procedure.[4] References[edit] ^ "Arakan National Council".
