Please consider expanding the lead to provide an accessible overview of all important aspects of the article. (July 2023) This article is about quantifying the concept of "typical value". For other uses, see Mean (disambiguation). For broader coverage of this topic, see Average. For the state of being mean or cruel, see Meanness. A mean is quantity that has a value which is intermediate to the extreme values of a set of numbers.[1] There are several kinds of means in mathematics, especially in statistics. Each mean serves to summarize a given group of data, often to better understand the overall value (magnitude and sign) of a given data set. For a data set, the arithmetic mean, also known as "arithmetic average", is a measure of central tendency of a finite set of numbers: specifically, the sum of the values divided by the number of values. The arithmetic mean of a set of numbers x1, x2, ..., xn is typically denoted using an overhead bar, x ¯ {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}} .[note 1] If the data set were based on a series of observations obtained by sampling from a statistical population, the arithmetic mean is the sample mean ( x ¯ {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}} ) to distinguish it from the mean, or expected value, of the underlying distribution, the population mean (denoted μ {\displaystyle \mu } or μ x {\displaystyle \mu _{x}} [note 2]).[2] Outside probability and statistics, a wide range of other notions of mean are often used in geometry and mathematical analysis; examples are given below. Types of means[edit] Pythagorean means[edit] Main article: Pythagorean means Arithmetic mean (AM)[edit] The arithmetic mean (or simply mean) of a list of numbers, is the sum of all of the numbers divided by the number of numbers. Similarly, the mean of a sample x 1 , x 2 , … , x n {\displaystyle x_{1},x_{2},\ldots ,x_{n}} , usually denoted by x ¯ {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}} , is the sum of the sampled values divided by the number of items in the sample. x ¯ = 1 n ( ∑ i = 1 n x i ) = x 1 + x 2 + ⋯ + x n n {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}={\frac {1}{n}}\left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}{x_{i}}\right)={\frac {x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots +x_{n}}{n}}} For example, the arithmetic mean of five values: 4, 36, 45, 50, 75 is: 4 + 36 + 45 + 50 + 75 5 = 210 5 = 42. {\displaystyle {\frac {4+36+45+50+75}{5}}={\frac {210}{5}}=42.} Geometric mean (GM)[edit] The geometric mean is an average that is useful for sets of positive numbers, that are interpreted according to their product (as is the case with rates of growth) and not their sum (as is the case with the arithmetic mean): x ¯ = ( ∏ i = 1 n x i ) 1 n = ( x 1 x 2 ⋯ x n ) 1 n {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}=\left(\prod _{i=1}^{n}{x_{i}}\right)^{\frac {1}{n}}=\left(x_{1}x_{2}\cdots x_{n}\right)^{\frac {1}{n}}} [3] For example, the geometric mean of five values: 4, 36, 45, 50, 75 is: ( 4 × 36 × 45 × 50 × 75 ) 1 5 = 24 300 000 5 = 30. {\displaystyle (4\times 36\times 45\times 50\times 75)^{\frac {1}{5}}={\sqrt[{5}]{24\;300\;000}}=30.} Harmonic mean (HM)[edit] The harmonic mean is an average which is useful for sets of numbers which are defined in relation to some unit, as in the case of speed (i.e., distance per unit of time): x ¯ = n ( ∑ i = 1 n 1 x i ) − 1 {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}=n\left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\frac {1}{x_{i}}}\right)^{-1}} For example, the harmonic mean of the five values: 4, 36, 45, 50, 75 is 5 1 4 + 1 36 + 1 45 + 1 50 + 1 75 = 5 1 3 = 15. {\displaystyle {\frac {5}{{\tfrac {1}{4}}+{\tfrac {1}{36}}+{\tfrac {1}{45}}+{\tfrac {1}{50}}+{\tfrac {1}{75}}}}={\frac {5}{\;{\tfrac {1}{3}}\;}}=15.} Relationship between AM, GM, and HM[edit] Proof without words of the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means: P R {\displaystyle PR} is the diameter of a circle centered on O {\displaystyle O} ; its radius A O {\displaystyle AO} is the arithmetic mean of a {\displaystyle a} and b {\displaystyle b} . Using the geometric mean theorem, triangle P G R {\displaystyle PGR} 's altitude G Q {\displaystyle GQ} is the geometric mean. For any ratio a : b {\displaystyle a:b} , A O ≥ G Q {\displaystyle AO\geq GQ} . Main article: Inequality of arithmetic and geometric means AM, GM, and HM satisfy these inequalities: A M ≥ G M ≥ H M {\displaystyle \mathrm {AM} \geq \mathrm {GM} \geq \mathrm {HM} \,} Equality holds if all the elements of the given sample are equal. Statistical location[edit] See also: Average § Statistical location Comparison of the arithmetic mean, median, and mode of two skewed (log-normal) distributions. Geometric visualization of the mode, median and mean of an arbitrary probability density function.[4] In descriptive statistics, the mean may be confused with the median, mode or mid-range, as any of these may incorrectly be called an "average" (more formally, a measure of central tendency). The mean of a set of observations is the arithmetic average of the values; however, for skewed distributions, the mean is not necessarily the same as the middle value (median), or the most likely value (mode). For example, mean income is typically skewed upwards by a small number of people with very large incomes, so that the majority have an income lower than the mean. By contrast, the median income is the level at which half the population is below and half is above. The mode income is the most likely income and favors the larger number of people with lower incomes. While the median and mode are often more intuitive measures for such skewed data, many skewed distributions are in fact best described by their mean, including the exponential and Poisson distributions. Mean of a probability distribution[edit] Main article: Expected value See also: Population mean The mean of a probability distribution is the long-run arithmetic average value of a random variable having that distribution. If the random variable is denoted by X {\displaystyle X} , then it is also known as the expected value of X {\displaystyle X} (denoted E ( X ) {\displaystyle E(X)} ). For a discrete probability distribution, the mean is given by ∑ x P ( x ) {\displaystyle \textstyle \sum xP(x)} , where the sum is taken over all possible values of the random variable and P ( x ) {\displaystyle P(x)} is the probability mass function. For a continuous distribution, the mean is ∫ − ∞ ∞ x f ( x ) d x {\displaystyle \textstyle \int _{-\infty }^{\infty }xf(x)\,dx} , where f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)} is the probability density function.[5] In all cases, including those in which the distribution is neither discrete nor continuous, the mean is the Lebesgue integral of the random variable with respect to its probability measure. The mean need not exist or be finite; for some probability distributions the mean is infinite (+∞ or −∞), while for others the mean is undefined. Generalized means[edit] Power mean[edit] The generalized mean, also known as the power mean or Hölder mean, is an abstraction of the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic means. It is defined for a set of n positive numbers xi by x ¯ ( m ) = ( 1 n ∑ i = 1 n x i m ) 1 m {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}(m)=\left({\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{m}\right)^{\frac {1}{m}}} [3] By choosing different values for the parameter m, the following types of means are obtained: lim m → ∞ {\displaystyle \lim _{m\to \infty }} maximum of x i {\displaystyle x_{i}} lim m → 2 {\displaystyle \lim _{m\to 2}} quadratic mean lim m → 1 {\displaystyle \lim _{m\to 1}} arithmetic mean lim m → 0 {\displaystyle \lim _{m\to 0}} geometric mean lim m → − 1 {\displaystyle \lim _{m\to -1}} harmonic mean lim m → − ∞ {\displaystyle \lim _{m\to -\infty }} minimum of x i {\displaystyle x_{i}} f-mean[edit] This can be generalized further as the generalized f-mean x ¯ = f − 1 ( 1 n ∑ i = 1 n f ( x i ) ) {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}=f^{-1}\left({{\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}{f\left(x_{i}\right)}}\right)} and again a suitable choice of an invertible f will give f ( x ) = x {\displaystyle f(x)=x} arithmetic mean, f ( x ) = 1 x {\displaystyle f(x)={\frac {1}{x}}} harmonic mean, f ( x ) = x m {\displaystyle f(x)=x^{m}} power mean, f ( x ) = ln ⁡ ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)=\ln(x)} geometric mean. Weighted arithmetic mean[edit] The weighted arithmetic mean (or weighted average) is used if one wants to combine average values from different sized samples of the same population: x ¯ = ∑ i = 1 n w i x i ¯ ∑ i = 1 n w i . {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}={\frac {\sum _{i=1}^{n}{w_{i}{\bar {x_{i}}}}}{\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}}}.} [3] Where x i ¯ {\displaystyle {\bar {x_{i}}}} and w i {\displaystyle w_{i}} are the mean and size of sample i {\displaystyle i} respectively. In other applications, they represent a measure for the reliability of the influence upon the mean by the respective values. Truncated mean[edit] Sometimes, a set of numbers might contain outliers (i.e., data values which are much lower or much higher than the others). Often, outliers are erroneous data caused by artifacts. In this case, one can use a truncated mean. It involves discarding given parts of the data at the top or the bottom end, typically an equal amount at each end and then taking the arithmetic mean of the remaining data. The number of values removed is indicated as a percentage of the total number of values. Interquartile mean[edit] The interquartile mean is a specific example of a truncated mean. It is simply the arithmetic mean after removing the lowest and the highest quarter of values. x ¯ = 2 n ∑ i = n 4 + 1 3 4 n x i {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}={\frac {2}{n}}\;\sum _{i={\frac {n}{4}}+1}^{{\frac {3}{4}}n}\!\!x_{i}} assuming the values have been ordered, so is simply a specific example of a weighted mean for a specific set of weights. Mean of a function[edit] Main article: Mean of a function In some circumstances, mathematicians may calculate a mean of an infinite (or even an uncountable) set of values. This can happen when calculating the mean va contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 38 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Mean responseCode 3 200
