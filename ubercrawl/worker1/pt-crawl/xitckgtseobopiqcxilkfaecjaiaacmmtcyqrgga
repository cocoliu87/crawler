History[edit] MusicOMH was founded and launched by Editor in Chief Michael Hubbard in 1999.[1] In February 2011, the site's former theatre section was spun off, becoming Exeunt Magazine, as MusicOMH refocused from being a general arts publication to writing primarily about music. Main features and coverage[edit] MusicOMH's music content consists of reviews of albums, gigs, tracks and festivals, alongside features, interviews and blog posts. The site also provides live reviews and other features.[2] The site's album reviews, usually covering a wide range of genres including pop, electro, classical, metal, rock and R&B,[1] have been quoted by numerous publications such as The Daily Telegraph, The Independent and the BBC.[3][4][5][6][7][8] The site has also been used as one of many sources to accumulate aggregated review scores for Metacritic.[9][10][11] Over the course of 20 years, the site has also conducted interviews with artists, ranging from house music duo Basement Jaxx, via Swedish band Miike Snow to rapper Jay-Z.[12][13][14] In September 2009, publications such as Contactmusic.com, AOL and Yahoo! Music used the interview with Jay-Z to spread word of his will to work with other notable musicians such as Jack White and Bono.[14][15][16][17] Awards and nominations[edit] The Independent described MusicOMH as "Brit-centric, accessible and unpretentious", in their list of the 25 best music websites in October 2009.[2] The site was nominated for Best Digital Publication at the 2009, 2010 and 2011 Record of the Day Awards.[18] See also[edit] Review site AnyDecentMusic?
