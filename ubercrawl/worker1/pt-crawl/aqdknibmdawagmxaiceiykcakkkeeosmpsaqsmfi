(AP via CNN) ITN Candidates for July 31 Nominating Mars. Could be a very important event in the future of mankind; makes colonization of the red planet more feasible.--Bedford Pray 00:08, 1 August 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] The ref tag added to the updated sentence was not closed and contained no content. I have removed it and replaced it with a {{fact}} tag. Unreferenced updates cannot be placed on ITN. Also, a single sentence of updated content is considered questionable for ITN; please add content as necessary to let the reader know the 'how' and 'what' of the story. Thanks, BanyanTree 03:51, 1 August 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] I am sceptic, two weeks ago it was announced that water ice was found. This is actually the first time they probed it. In any case, the article needs some more about this and there's plenty of info at the NASA website. --Tone 07:04, 1 August 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] I have added the ref several hours ago.--Bedford Pray 15:50, 1 August 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Discussion over this item appears to be stalemated in no consensus. ITN candidates lacking consensus may be posted at the discretion of an admin, but input from other reviewers to clarify consensus would be appreciated. - BanyanTree 21:36, 1 August 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] While I'm here, nom Potjaman Shinawatra. - BanyanTree 03:53, 1 August 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Not ITN in my opinion. If it were a head of state directly, this would be a good candidate but since it's his wife... --Tone 07:04, 1 August 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Discussion over this item appears to be stalemated in no consensus.

(NASA) ITN Candidates for July 30 Prospective nom of Qantas Flight 30. Assuming that the AFD discussion is closed after the normal five days, this article will become a viable candidate very soon and it'd be worth seeing what people think of posting this hook. - BanyanTree 11:06, 30 July 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Unless this has some wider ramifications, like a grounding of the fleet or an overhaul in aeroplane design, then as an isolated incident in which fortunately no one perished I don't think it should go up. Hammer Raccoon (talk) 00:36, 31 July 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] In any case, this is already a six days old item so the others have a priority. --Tone 06:34, 31 July 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] I think the Olmert item could go up when he resigns. SpencerT♦C 21:33, 30 July 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] No, this is his actual announcement of resignation; his actual resignation day will be fairly uneventful. However, the current wording sounds kind of off. How about: Prime Minister of Israel Ehud Olmert announces that he will not participate in the Kadima September primary election, effectively signaling his resignation as Prime Minister. Lockesdonkey (talk) 21:40, 30 July 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Could reviewers of this item please specify whether they want it posted now or if there should be a wait until the actual resignation, though both is always an option. - BanyanTree 22:04, 30 July 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] I think this could go up, but if we have a large glut of other stuff (2+), this should wait. And also, as of now, there is only a two sentence update in the article, so it wouldn't be appicable. SpencerT♦C 00:21, 31 July 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] I think it should go up now: this was the big announcement, the rest is just technicalities. I have expanded the information on his resignation slightly in the Ehud Olmert article, and added a link to the full text of the resignation speech. --Zvika (talk) 06:24, 31 July 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Looks good now. Maybe the wording could be changed to stress the fact he is resigning, not that he is not running in the party elections. And there is a pd image as well, could be used. --Tone 06:34, 31 July 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] How about this: Amidst accusations of corruption, Prime Minister of Israel Ehud Olmert announces he will resign following the Kadima party primary election in September. --Zvika (talk) 06:58, 31 July 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] (edit conflict) Posted. - BanyanTree 07:08, 31 July 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] July 29 July 29, 2008 (2008-07-29) (Tuesday) edit history watch The International Olympic Committee lifts its ban on Iraqi athletes participating in the Beijing Olympics following assurances from the Government of Iraq about the independence of the Iraqi Olympic Committee.

(BBC News) ITN Candidates for July 29 2008 Chino Hills earthquake? --Elliskev 23:56, 29 July 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] On a procedural level, ITN won't highlight articles with AFD tags, like the Qantas article suggested below, but it appears that this might end up with a SNOW keep and would therefore be eligible in time. I'll leave judgment about notability to other reviewers. - BanyanTree 00:19, 30 July 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Wait until AFD is over. But still, it's only 5.8, pretty low for ITN standards...but still I'll support. SpencerT♦C 01:18, 30 July 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] I don't know... it's a relatively minor quake for Calif., and it's not even the biggest U.S. news story of the day (that being the indictment of Senator Ted Stevens). -- Mwalcoff (talk) 04:19, 30 July 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] They are only talking about three things on CNN: the murder of that woman soldier, the earthquake, and the senator's indictment. I think the earthquake is notable enough, but barely.--haha169 (talk) 05:30, 30 July 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] I doubt a sub-6.0 earthquake isn't important if it's in a place where they happen all the time (compare to Illinois and Market Rasen, the strongest earthquakes to hit a whole state/country for years).
