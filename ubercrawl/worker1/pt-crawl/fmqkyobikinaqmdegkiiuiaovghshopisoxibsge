October 31 Tropical Storm Noel is located to the north of Cuba, after causing at least 67 deaths along its path, most in the Dominican Republic and Haiti.

Should we include this on ITN? AecisBrievenbus 11:50, 31 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Not all of the relevant articles have been updated yet, but: "The Audiencia Nacional in Madrid sentences three men to 4,000 years in prison each, for their role in the 2004 train bombings in the Spanish capital."

Felipe C.S ( talk ) 15:52, 31 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I tried to see what it looks like, using Show Preview, and it basically shows an unidentifiable man holding up a white, barely legible sign. I believe it should be instantly clear what the ITN picture is about. This picture doesn't make it clear right away. AecisBrievenbus 16:02, 31 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I think people would much rather look at the pretty woman then a man holding a white sign...--Plasma Twa 2 22:53, 31 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] The United States Federal Reserve reduces short-term interest rates to 4.5 per cent, the second cut in three months. I think this is more important in terms of impact and significance than than a tropical storm or an elderly clam, should be considered. EtTuMercader I don't see the significance of something like this. I see how it affects Americans, but how does this affect Canada or the UK? I think there is alot more interest in a tropical storm then this. --Plasma Twa 2 03:28, 1 November 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] It effects everyone because of the international nature of finance and economics. The housing market bubble collapse and the subsequent credit crunch, which started in the U.S., has started a worldwide economic downturn. This change intends to reverse that. Take a look at the Asian financial crisis for a good example of how an economic problem in one country, even a smaller one like Thailand can have huge ramificatons around the globe. Economics might not be as flashy as a storm, but it is of much greater importance and, conceivably, interest. And if interest is to trump importance, than I think we are missing some important celebrity news that arguably more people would be interested in. EtTuMercader Is there anything particularly special about this interest rate change? Central banks regularly change interest rates in many countries. According to Federal Reserve System, the US Federal Reserve has changed them at least 30 times since 2001. Bistromathic 10:30, 1 November 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] It's the second cut after a dizzying series of rate hikes. Besides the ripple effects throughout the global financial system of rate changes in U.S. market, the new Fed chairman is still under the skeptical eye of the financial community after the departure of Saint Alan. While the first rate cut was definitely ITN worthy, this second is marginal. Unfortunately, the relevant 'update' is a badly-formatted unreferenced sentence that gives no context both for the rationale and the effects. - BanyanTree 10:49, 1 November 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] If you understand it's importance, as you obviously do, but think the phrasing is so badly lacking why don't you come up with something yourself? I chose a short and simple sentence from the newsfeed because while I wanted to limit the size of the item because it is less important than the first rate cut but still important enough to include. Besides, most explanations aren't going to be able to explain the cause, effects, or importance of this to a person without at least a little background in economics and knowledge of the recent credit crunch. EtTuMercader I am not referring to the suggested hook, but referring to the update at Federal Reserve System#Federal funds rate and discount rate, which in total states, "The current rate is 4.50 effective from Oct 31 2007." I suggest rereading WP:ITNMP before replying. - BanyanTree 07:53, 2 November 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Definite include; this sort of thing has major impacts globally, especially given the current situation. Unfortunately, I don't know enough finance to even begin to make it sound coherent, accurate, and NPOV. • Lawrence Cohen 04:52, 2 November 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] In an attempt to allay a credit crunch resulting from the recent 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis the United States Federal Reserve reduces short-term interest rates to 4.5 percent, the second cut after a long series of rate increases. Like this one better? EtTuMercader You misunderstand. Your original hook was fine. However, ITN is not a news ticker. A person wondering "so what?" must be able to click the bolded link and find the "what". The article is not sufficiently updated to inform a reader about the context of the ITN hook. The article Federal Reserve System has no context for the rate hike and, worse, it has no references. Expand and source the article, not your suggested hook. - BanyanTree 08:31, 3 November 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] October 30 FIFA will announce the host of the 2014 FIFA World Cup at 14:30 GMT. That is one hour from now, right? The host is expected to be Brazil. How about adding "The Federation of International Football Associations announces that Brazil will host the 2014 FIFA World Cup." to ITN, hidden from view? When it is announced, all we have to do is remove <!-- and -->.

Server glitch? AecisBrievenbus 17:03, 30 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I assume the mediawiki job queue just happens to be long. The job queue handles some of the consequences of an edit, such as updating pages which include a changed template. This is done not done immediately when the edit is made because sometimes thousands of pages need to be updated, but will be done eventually. You can see the job queue length at special:statistics. You can force a page to be updated immediately by loading it with &purge=true, in this case [2]. Thue | talk 18:14, 30 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Why not add "and Germany the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup"? Done. I was surprised both were not added to the Main Page when this story was going up. If you have any questions, please contact me at my talk page. Ian Manka 02:01, 31 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Just a follow up to note that I am replacing International Federation of Association Football by Fédération Internationale de Football Association, per WP:ERROR. -- lucasbfr talk 14:11, 31 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] October 28 The Boston Red Sox defeat the Colorado Rockies to win baseball's 2007 World Series, 4 games to none at Coors Field, Denver, Colorado. --Howard the Duck 04:12, 29 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] This can't possibly be world news, certainly not in comparison to international sports such as soccer or rugby.--WaltCip 15:02, 29 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] The historical precedent is that the most important championship in the world for any well-known sport automatically qualifies for ITN inclusion even if that championship is of limited geographic scope. Dragons flight 15:45, 29 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] If it helps as well, the Red Sox, like the Yankees and certain other teams, are functionally 'regional' teams, with substantially larger followings than most small-market teams. Arguably, the Red Sox may have the largest fanbase geographically of any baseball team in the world. And between this and the clam story, New England apparently owns ITN right now. • Lawrence Cohen 16:24, 29 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Of course it's world news. Look at its name; it's the World Series. Duh. Preston 23:38, 29 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I realy hope you're being sarcastic, Preston. It has two different countries in it, and one of them dominates much more than the other. And in regards to Dragons flight comment - the AFL grand final did not get put up, even though the AFL primership is, in your words, "the most important championship in the world for any well-known sport [Australian football]". Geelong Football Club#Current playing list doesn't specify the nationalities of the team members - I'd assume they're all Aussies. In contrast, BoSox has 2 Japanese, 2 Canadians, 3 Puerto Ricans, 4 players from the Dominican Republic, etc. In addition, the World Series was big in Japan, especially since Dice-K became the first Japanese pitcher to Win a WS game. And it's the top prize in club baseball, maybe even in all of baseball. --Howard the Duck 12:40, 30 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Your argument is flawed - three of your countries listed are very geographically close, except for Japan (they're crazy about baseball too, though).
