A testicle or testis (pl.: testes) is the male reproductive gland or gonad in all bilaterians, including humans. It is homologous to the female ovary. The functions of the testes are to produce both sperm and androgens, primarily testosterone. Testosterone release is controlled by the anterior pituitary luteinizing hormone, whereas sperm production is controlled both by the anterior pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone and gonadal testosterone. Structure Appearance Male gonad (testes, left) and female gonad (ovaries, right) Males have two testicles of similar size contained within the scrotum, which is an extension of the abdominal wall.[1] Scrotal asymmetry, in which one testicle extends farther down into the scrotum than the other, is common. This is because of the differences in the vasculature's anatomy.[1] For 85% of men, the right testis hangs lower than the left one.[1] Measurement and volume The volume of the testicle can be estimated by palpating it and comparing it to ellipsoids of known sizes. Another method is to use calipers (an orchidometer) or a ruler either on the person or on an ultrasound image to obtain the three measurements of the x, y, and z axes (length, depth and width). These measurements can then be used to calculate the volume, using the formula for the volume of an ellipsoid: V o l u m e = 4 3 ⋅ π ⋅ l e n g t h 2 ⋅ w i d t h 2 ⋅ d e p t h 2 {\displaystyle Volume={\frac {4}{3}}\cdot \pi \cdot {\frac {length}{2}}\cdot {\frac {width}{2}}\cdot {\frac {depth}{2}}} ≈ l e n g t h ⋅ w i d t h ⋅ d e p t h ⋅ 0.52 {\displaystyle \approx length\cdot width\cdot depth\cdot 0.52} However, the most accurate calculation of actual testicular volume is gained from the formula:[2] ≈ l e n g t h ⋅ w i d t h ⋅ d e p t h ⋅ 0.71 {\displaystyle \approx length\cdot width\cdot depth\cdot 0.71} An average adult testicle measures up to 5 cm × 2 cm × 3 cm (2 in × 3⁄4 in × 1+1⁄4 in). The Tanner scale, which is used to assess the maturity of the male genitalia, assigns a maturity stage to the calculated volume ranging from stage I, a volume of less than 1.5 cm3; to stage V, a volume greater than 20 cm3. Normal volume is 15 to 25 cm3; the average is 18 cm3 per testis (range 12–30 cm3).[1] The number of spermatozoa an adult human male produces is directly proportional to testicular volume, as larger testicles contain more seminiferous tubules and Sertoli cells as a result.[3] As such, men with larger testicles produce on average more sperm cells in each ejaculate, as testicular volume is positively correlated with semen profiles.[4] Internal structure Transverse section through the left side of the scrotum and the left testis Duct system The testes are covered by a tough fibrous shell called the tunica albuginea.[5] Under the tunica albuginea, the testes contain very fine-coiled tubes called seminiferous tubules.[5] The tubules are lined with a layer of cells (germ cells) that develop from puberty through old age into sperm cells (also known as spermatozoa or male gametes).[5] The developing sperm travel through the seminiferous tubules to the rete testis located in the mediastinum testis, to the efferent ducts, and then to the epididymis where newly created sperm cells mature (spermatogenesis).[6] The sperm move into the vas deferens, and are eventually expelled through the urethra and out of the urethral orifice through muscular contractions.[6] Primary cell types Within the seminiferous tubules, the germ cells develop into spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoa through the process of spermatogenesis. The gametes contain DNA for fertilization of an ovum[7] Sertoli cells – the true epithelium of the seminiferous epithelium, critical for the support of germ cell development into spermatozoa. Sertoli cells secrete inhibin.[8] Peritubular myoid cells surround the seminiferous tubules.[9] Between tubules (interstitial cells) exist Leydig cells[10] – cells localized between seminiferous tubules that produce and secrete testosterone and other androgens important for puberty (including secondary sexual characteristics like facial hair), sexual behavior, and libido. Sertoli cells support spermatogenesis.[11] Testosterone controls testicular volume. Immature Leydig cells and interstitial macrophages and epithelial cells are also present. Blood supply and lymphatic drainage The testis has three sources of arterial blood supply: the testicular artery, the cremasteric artery, and the artery to the ductus deferens.[12] Blood supply and lymphatic drainage of the testes and scrotum are distinct: The paired testicular arteries arise directly from the abdominal aorta and descend through the inguinal canal, while the scrotum and the rest of the external genitalia is supplied by the internal pudendal artery (a branch of the internal iliac artery).[13][14] The testis has collateral blood supply from the cremasteric artery (a branch of the inferior epigastric artery, which is a branch of the external iliac artery), and the artery to the ductus deferens (a branch of the inferior vesical artery, which is a branch of the internal iliac artery).[15][16] Therefore, if the testicular artery is ligated, e.g., during a Fowler-Stevens orchiopexy for a high undescended testis, the testis will usually survive on these other blood supplies.[17] Lymphatic drainage of the testes follows the testicular arteries back to the paraaortic lymph nodes, while lymph from the scrotum drains to the inguinal lymph nodes.[13][16] Layers 3D anatomy of the layers surrounding the testis Many anatomical features of the adult testis reflect its developmental origin in the abdomen. The layers of tissue enclosing each testicle are derived from the layers of the anterior abdominal wall.[1] The cremasteric muscle arises from the internal oblique muscle.[1][18] The blood–testis barrier Main article: Blood–testis barrier Large molecules cannot pass from the blood into the lumen of a seminiferous tubule due to the presence of tight junctions between adjacent Sertoli cells.[13] The spermatogonia occupy the basal compartment (deep to the level of the tight junctions) and the more mature forms, such as primary and secondary spermatocytes and spermatids, occupy the adluminal compartment.[13] The function of the blood–testis barrier may be to prevent an auto-immune reaction.[13] Mature sperm (and their antigens) emerge significantly after immune tolerance is set in infancy.[13] Since sperm are antigenically different from self-tissue, a male animal can react immunologically to his own sperm. The male can make antibodies against them.[13] Injection of sperm antigens causes inflammation of the testis (auto-immune orchitis) and reduced fertility.[13] The blood–testis barrier may reduce the likelihood that sperm proteins will induce an immune response.[19] Temperature regulation and responses Spermatogenesis is enhanced at temperatures slightly less than core body temperature. The spermatogenesis is less efficient at lower and higher temperatures than 33 °C. Because the testes are located outside the body, the smooth tissue of the scrotum can move them closer or further away from the body.[5] The temperature of the testes is maintained at 34.4 °C, a little below body temperature, as temperatures above 36.7 °C impede spermatogenesis.[1][5] There are a number of mechanisms to maintain the testes at the optimum temperature.[20] The cremasteric muscle covers the testicles and the spermatic cord.[21] When this muscle contracts, the cord shortens and the testicles move closer up toward the body, which provides slightly more warmth to maintain optimal testicular temperature.[21] When cooling is required, the cremasteric muscle relaxes and the testicles lower away from the warm body and are able to cool.[21] Contraction also occurs in response to physical stress, such as blunt trauma; the testicles withdraw and the scrotum shrinks very close to the body in an effort to protect them.[22] The cremasteric reflex will reflexively raise the testicles. The testicles can also be lifted voluntarily using the pubococcygeus muscle, which partially activates related muscles. Gene and protein expression Further information: Bioinformatics § Gene and protein expression The human genome includes approximately 20,000 protein coding genes: 80% of these genes are expressed in adult testes.[23] The testes have the highest fraction of tissue type-specific genes compared to other organs and tissues.[24] About 1000 of them are highly specific for the testes,[23] and about 2,200 show an elevated pattern of expression. A majority of these genes encode for proteins that are expressed in the seminiferous tubules and have functions related to spermatogenesis.[24] Sperm cells express proteins that result in the development of flagella; these same proteins are expressed in the female in cells lining the Fallopian tube and cause the development of cilia. Sperm cell flagella and Fallopian tube cilia are homologous structures. The testis-specific  contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 40 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Testes responseCode 3 200
