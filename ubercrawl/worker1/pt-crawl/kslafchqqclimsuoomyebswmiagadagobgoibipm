Abbreviations Edit summaries Glossary HTML Shortcuts Templates Wikitext Directory Shortcuts WP:WP WP:LOS WP:CUTS WP:SHORTCUTS WP:ALPHABETSOUP This is an index of abbreviated redirects and the pages they lead to (mainly in the Wikipedia namespace). For a list of community related shortcuts such as for WikiProjects and Portals, see WP:WPR and WP:PORTCUT, respectively. For a list of shortcuts to Wikipedia talk pages, see WT:WT. For a table of all one-, two-, and three-letter shortcuts, see WP:SCT. For other useful directories and indexes, see Wikipedia:Directories and indexes. How to create a shortcut[edit] Shortcuts exist as redirects pointing from the title of the shortcut (for example, Wikipedia:START) to its target (in this case, Portal:Contents). Notice that project shortcuts are usually listed with the prefix "WP" and not "Wikipedia"; this is because when "WP" or "Wp" appears before a colon in a page name, MediaWiki automatically expands it to "Wikipedia". Therefore, there is no need to create shortcuts literally starting with "WP:" as opposed to "Wikipedia:". Prefixes similar to "WP" can be found at Wikipedia:Shortcut#List of prefixes. Shortcut redirects should be tagged with Template:R from shortcut(edit talk links history) so they will auto-categorize in Category:Redirects from shortcuts. Example: #redirect [[Pagename]] {{R from shortcut}} See also: Wikipedia:Template index/Redirect pages Browsing the encyclopedia[edit] Pagename Redirects Portal:Contents WP:START, WP:CONTENTS, WP:EXPLORE Portal:Contents/Aâ€“Z index WP:QI Portal:Contents/Categories WP:BROWSE, WP:TI Portal:Contents/Glossaries WP:GLO, WP:LG Portal:Contents/Lists WP:LOT Portal:Contents/Outlines WP:OOK Portal:Contents/Overviews WP:LOO, WP:VIEW Portal:Contents/Portals P:, P:CP Portal:Current events WP:CURRENT Portal:Featured content WP:FC Wikipedia:Directory WP:DIR, WP:INDEX Wikipedia:Editor's index to Wikipedia WP:EIW, WP:A-Z Wikipedia:Portal/Directory WP:P/D Back to contents Portal shortcuts[edit] Shortcut WP:PORTCUT Pagename Redirects Portal:Architecture P:ARCH Portal:Argentina P:ARG Portal:Australia P:AU, P:AUS Portal:Aviation P:AVIA Portal:Bangladesh P:BD Portal:Beer P:BEER Portal:Canada P:CA Portal:Climate change P:CC, P:GW Portal:Conservatism P:RIGHT Portal:Drink P:DRINK Portal:Edinburgh P:EDI, P:EDIN Portal:Food P:FD Portal:Geography P:GEO Portal:Germany P:DE, P:GER Portal:Haiti P:HT, P:HAI Portal:Hawaii P:HI, P:HAWAII Portal:Hong Kong P:HK, WP:PHK Portal:History P:HIS Portal:India P:IN, WP:PIN Portal:Judaism P:JEW Portal:London transport P:LT, P:TFL, P:LUL, P:TUBE Portal:Latin America P:LA Portal:Latter Day Saint movement P:LDSM, P:MORMON, P:LDS, P:LDSCHURCH, P:MORMONS, P:MORMONCHURCH, P:HL, P:HLDS Portal:Law P:LAW, P:ENGLAW Portal:Literature P:LIT Portal:Martial arts P:MA Portal:Music P:MUS Portal:New Zealand P:NZ Portal:North East England P:NEE Portal:Northern Ireland P:NIR Portal:Novels P:NOV Portal:Outer space P:SPACE Portal:Oxfordshire P:OX Portal:Philippines P:PH, P:RP Portal:Poland P:PL Portal:Scotland P:SCO, P:SCOT Portal:Scottish islands P:ISLE, P:ISLES Portal:South East England P:SEE, WP:SEE Portal:Stars P:STR, P:ST Portal:Switzerland P:CH Portal:Technology P:TECH Portal:Trains P:TRAINS Portal:Ukraine P:UKR Portal:Underwater diving P:SCUBA Portal:United Kingdom P:UK Portal:United States P:US, P:USA Portal:University of Oxford P:OXFORD Portal:Video games P:VG Portal:Wine P:WINE Wikipedia:Featured portals P:FP, WP:FPORT Wikipedia:Featured portal candidates WP:FPCAN, WP:FPOC Back to contents Project shortcuts[edit] Shortcut WP:WPR "Wikipedia:WPR" redirects here.
