A photograph of her wearing the T-shirt has become iconic.[19] During the protest, she is reported to have broken open a water pipe to allow protestors to wash tear gas from their eyes, thrown a tear gas canister back at police, and encouraged protestors to take cover when live rounds were fired.[17] While she was on the front line of the protest she was shot dead.[20][17] Prior to the event, she had made a Facebook post stating her blood type in case she was injured and her wish for her organs to be donated should she die during the protest.[21] Her funeral on 4 March 2021 was attended by several thousands of protesters.[22][23] The next day, authorities went to the cemetery where her remains were buried and exhumed the body for autopsy.[24][25] References[edit] ^ "缅甸政变：民众上街悼念被枪杀的华裔女子邓家希".
