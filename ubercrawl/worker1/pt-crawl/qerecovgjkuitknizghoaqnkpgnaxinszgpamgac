An ellipsoid is a quadric surface;  that is, a surface that may be defined as the zero set of a polynomial of degree two in three variables. Among quadric surfaces, an ellipsoid is characterized by either of the two following properties. Every planar cross section is either an ellipse, or is empty, or is reduced to a single point (this explains the name, meaning "ellipse-like"). It is bounded, which means that it may be enclosed in a sufficiently large sphere. An ellipsoid has three pairwise perpendicular axes of symmetry which intersect at a center of symmetry, called the center of the ellipsoid. The line segments that are delimited on the axes of symmetry by the ellipsoid are called the principal axes, or simply axes of the ellipsoid. If the three axes have different lengths, the figure is a triaxial ellipsoid (rarely scalene ellipsoid), and the axes are uniquely defined. If two of the axes have the same length, then the ellipsoid is an ellipsoid of revolution, also called a spheroid. In this case, the ellipsoid is invariant under a rotation around the third axis, and there are thus infinitely many ways of choosing the two perpendicular axes of the same length. If the third axis is shorter, the ellipsoid is an oblate spheroid; if it is longer, it is a prolate spheroid. If the three axes have the same length, the ellipsoid is a sphere. Standard equation[edit] The general ellipsoid, also known as triaxial ellipsoid, is a quadratic surface which is defined in Cartesian coordinates as: x 2 a 2 + y 2 b 2 + z 2 c 2 = 1 , {\displaystyle {\frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}}+{\frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}}+{\frac {z^{2}}{c^{2}}}=1,} where a {\displaystyle a} , b {\displaystyle b} and c {\displaystyle c} are the length of the semi-axes. The points ( a , 0 , 0 ) {\displaystyle (a,0,0)} , ( 0 , b , 0 ) {\displaystyle (0,b,0)} and ( 0 , 0 , c ) {\displaystyle (0,0,c)} lie on the surface. The line segments from the origin to these points are called the principal semi-axes of the ellipsoid, because a, b, c are half the length of the principal axes. They correspond to the semi-major axis and semi-minor axis of an ellipse. In spherical coordinate system for which ( x , y , z ) = ( r sin ⁡ θ cos ⁡ φ , r sin ⁡ θ sin ⁡ φ , r cos ⁡ θ ) {\displaystyle (x,y,z)=(r\sin \theta \cos \varphi ,r\sin \theta \sin \varphi ,r\cos \theta )} , the general ellipsoid is defined as: r 2 sin 2 ⁡ θ cos 2 ⁡ φ a 2 + r 2 sin 2 ⁡ θ sin 2 ⁡ φ b 2 + r 2 cos 2 ⁡ θ c 2 = 1 , {\displaystyle {r^{2}\sin ^{2}\theta \cos ^{2}\varphi \over a^{2}}+{r^{2}\sin ^{2}\theta \sin ^{2}\varphi \over b^{2}}+{r^{2}\cos ^{2}\theta \over c^{2}}=1,} where θ {\displaystyle \theta } is the polar angle and φ {\displaystyle \varphi } is the azimuthal angle. When a = b = c {\displaystyle a=b=c} , the ellipsoid is a sphere. When a = b ≠ c {\displaystyle a=b\neq c} , the ellipsoid is a spheroid or ellipsoid of revolution. In particular, if a = b > c {\displaystyle a=b>c} , it is an oblate spheroid; if a = b < c {\displaystyle a=b<c} , it is a prolate spheroid. Parameterization[edit] The ellipsoid may be parameterized in several ways, which are simpler to express when the ellipsoid axes coincide with coordinate axes. A common choice is x = a sin ⁡ ( θ ) cos ⁡ ( φ ) , y = b sin ⁡ ( θ ) sin ⁡ ( φ ) , z = c cos ⁡ ( θ ) , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x&=a\sin(\theta )\cos(\varphi ),\\y&=b\sin(\theta )\sin(\varphi ),\\z&=c\cos(\theta ),\end{aligned}}\,\!} where 0 ≤ θ ≤ π , 0 ≤ φ < 2 π . {\displaystyle 0\leq \theta \leq \pi ,\qquad 0\leq \varphi <2\pi .} These parameters may be interpreted as spherical coordinates, where θ is the polar angle and φ is the azimuth angle of the point (x, y, z) of the ellipsoid.[1] Measuring from the equator rather than a pole, x = a cos ⁡ ( θ ) cos ⁡ ( λ ) , y = b cos ⁡ ( θ ) sin ⁡ ( λ ) , z = c sin ⁡ ( θ ) , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x&=a\cos(\theta )\cos(\lambda ),\\y&=b\cos(\theta )\sin(\lambda ),\\z&=c\sin(\theta ),\end{aligned}}\,\!} where − π 2 ≤ θ ≤ π 2 , 0 ≤ λ < 2 π , {\displaystyle -{\tfrac {\pi }{2}}\leq \theta \leq {\tfrac {\pi }{2}},\qquad 0\leq \lambda <2\pi ,} θ is the reduced latitude, parametric latitude, or eccentric anomaly and λ is azimuth or longitude. Measuring angles directly to the surface of the ellipsoid, not to the circumscribed sphere, [ x y z ] = R [ cos ⁡ ( γ ) cos ⁡ ( λ ) cos ⁡ ( γ ) sin ⁡ ( λ ) sin ⁡ ( γ ) ] {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\\z\end{bmatrix}}=R{\begin{bmatrix}\cos(\gamma )\cos(\lambda )\\\cos(\gamma )\sin(\lambda )\\\sin(\gamma )\end{bmatrix}}\,\!} where R = a b c c 2 ( b 2 cos 2 ⁡ λ + a 2 sin 2 ⁡ λ ) cos 2 ⁡ γ + a 2 b 2 sin 2 ⁡ γ , − π 2 ≤ γ ≤ π 2 , 0 ≤ λ < 2 π . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}R={}&{\frac {abc}{\sqrt {c^{2}\left(b^{2}\cos ^{2}\lambda +a^{2}\sin ^{2}\lambda \right)\cos ^{2}\gamma +a^{2}b^{2}\sin ^{2}\gamma }}},\\[3pt]&-{\tfrac {\pi }{2}}\leq \gamma \leq {\tfrac {\pi }{2}},\qquad 0\leq \lambda <2\pi .\end{aligned}}} γ would be geocentric latitude on the Earth, and λ is longitude. These are true spherical coordinates with the origin at the center of the ellipsoid.[citation needed] In geodesy, the geodetic latitude is most commonly used, as the angle between the vertical and the equatorial plane, defined for a biaxial ellipsoid. For a more general triaxial ellipsoid, see ellipsoidal latitude. Volume[edit] The volume bounded by the ellipsoid is V = 4 3 π a b c . {\displaystyle V={\tfrac {4}{3}}\pi abc.} In terms of the principal diameters A, B, C (where A = 2a, B = 2b, C = 2c), the volume is V = π 6 A B C {\displaystyle V={\tfrac {\pi }{6}}ABC} . This equation reduces to that of the volume of a sphere when all three elliptic radii are equal, and to that of an oblate or prolate spheroid when two of them are equal. The volume of an ellipsoid is 2/3 the volume of a circumscribed elliptic cylinder, and π/6 the volume of the circumscribed box. The volumes of the inscribed and circumscribed boxes are respectively: V inscribed = 8 3 3 a b c , V circumscribed = 8 a b c . {\displaystyle V_{\text{inscribed}}={\frac {8}{3{\sqrt {3}}}}abc,\qquad V_{\text{circumscribed}}=8abc.} Surface area[edit] See also: Area of a geodesic polygon The surface area of a general (triaxial) ellipsoid is[2][3] S = 2 π c 2 + 2 π a b sin ⁡ ( φ ) ( E ( φ , k ) sin 2 ⁡ ( φ ) + F ( φ , k ) cos 2 ⁡ ( φ ) ) , {\displaystyle S=2\pi c^{2}+{\frac {2\pi ab}{\sin(\varphi )}}\left(E(\varphi ,k)\,\sin ^{2}(\varphi )+F(\varphi ,k)\,\cos ^{2}(\varphi )\right),} where cos ⁡ ( φ ) = c a , k 2 = a 2 ( b 2 − c 2 ) b 2 ( a 2 − c 2 ) , a ≥ b ≥ c , {\displaystyle \cos(\varphi )={\frac {c}{a}},\qquad k^{2}={\frac {a^{2}\left(b^{2}-c^{2}\right)}{b^{2}\left(a^{2}-c^{2}\right)}},\qquad a\geq b\geq c,} and where F(φ, k) and E(φ, k) are incomplete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind respectively.[4] The surface area of this general ellipsoid can also be expressed using the RF and RD Carlson symmetric forms of the elliptic integrals by simply substituting the above formula to the respective definitions: S = 2 π c 2 + 2 π a b [ R F ( c 2 a 2 , c 2 b 2 , 1 ) − 1 3 ( 1 − c 2 a 2 ) ( 1 − c 2 b 2 ) R D ( c 2 a 2 , c 2 b 2 , 1 ) ] . {\displaystyle S=2\pi c^{2}+2\pi ab\left[R_{F}\left({\frac {c^{2}}{a^{2}}},{\frac {c^{2}}{b^{2}}},1\right)-{\frac {1}{3}}\left(1-{\frac {c^{2}}{a^{2}}}\right)\left(1-{\frac {c^{2}}{b^{2}}}\right)R_{D}\left({\frac {c^{2}}{a^{2}}},{\frac {c^{2}}{b^{2}}},1\right)\right].} Unlike the expression with F(φ, k) and E(φ, k), the variant based on the Carlson symmetric integrals yields valid results for a sphere and only the axis c must be the smallest, the order between the two larger axes, a and b can be arbitrary. The surface area of an ellipsoid of revolution (or spheroid) may be expressed in terms of elementary functions: S oblate = 2 π a 2 ( 1 + c 2 e a 2 artanh ⁡ e ) , where e 2 = 1 − c 2 a 2 and ( c < a ) , {\displaystyle S_{\text{oblate}}=2\pi a^{2}\left(1+{\frac {c^{2}}{ea^{2}}}\operatorname {artanh} e\right),\qquad {\text{where }}e^{2}=1-{\frac {c^{2}}{a^{2}}}{\text{ and }}(c<a),} or S oblate = 2 π a 2 ( 1 + 1 − e 2 e artanh ⁡ e ) {\displaystyle S_{\text{oblate}}=2\pi a^{2}\left(1+{\frac {1-e^{2}}{e}}\operatorname {artanh} e\right)} or S oblate = 2 π a 2 + π c 2 e ln ⁡ 1 + e 1 − e {\displaystyle S_{\text{oblate}}=2\pi a^{2}\ +{\frac {\pi c^{2}}{e}}\ln {\frac {1+e}{1-e}}} and S prolate = 2 π a 2 ( 1 + c a e arcsin ⁡ e ) where e 2 = 1 − a 2 c 2 and ( c > a ) , {\displaystyle S_{\text{prolate}}=2\pi a^{2}\left(1+{\frac {c}{ae}}\arcsin e\right)\qquad {\text{where }}e^{2}=1-{\frac {a^{2}}{c^{2}}}{\text{ and }}(c>a),} which, as follows from basic trigonometric identities, are equivalent expressions (i.e. the formula for Soblate can be used to calculate the surface area of a prolate ellipsoid and vice versa). In both cases e may again be identified as the eccentricity of the ellipse formed by the cross section through the symmetry axis. (See ellipse). Derivations of these results may be found in standard sources, for example Mathworld.[5] Approximate formula[edit] S ≈ 4 π a p b p + a p c p + b p c p 3 p . {\displaystyle S\approx 4\pi {\sqrt[{p}]{\frac {a^{p}b^{p}+a^{p}c^{p}+b^{p}c^{p}}{3}}}.\,\!} Here p ≈ 1.6075 yields a relative error of at most 1.061%;[6] a value of p = 8/5 = 1.6 is optimal for nearly spherical ellipsoids, with a relative error of at most 1.178%. In the "flat" limit of c much smaller than a and b, the area is approximately 2πab, equivalent to p = log23 ≈ 1.5849625007.
