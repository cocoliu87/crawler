His Excellency Yee Mon ရည်မွန် Minister of Defense of National Unity Government of Myanmar Incumbent Assumed office 16 April 2021; 2 years ago (2021-04-16) Appointed by Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw President Win Myint Duwa Lashi La Preceded by Office established Personal details Born (1967-08-09) August 9, 1967 (age 56) Maha Aungmye Township, Mandalay Region Political party National League for Democracy Profession Politician, poet Yee Mon (Burmese: ရည်မွန်; also known as Maung Tin Thit or Tin Thit; born 9 August 1967) is a Burmese poet, former political prisoner, and politician currently serving as Minister of Defense of National Unity Government of Myanmar.[1][2] Yee Mon attended the medical school (University of Medicine, Mandalay) in 1984. During the pro-democracy uprising of 1988 against the military junta that ruled Burma[1] he participated in the protests, and was imprisoned by the regime for seven years. Yee Mon / Maung Tin Thit later worked as an environmental activist.[1] In the 2015 general election, Tin Thit successfully ran as a candidate for Parliament with the National League for Democracy in a district in the national capital of Naypyidaw.[1] Tin Thit received 27,321 votes, narrowly defeating U Wai Lwin, a powerful former military general who had been defense minister until a few months before the elections.[1] Tin Thit's victory was viewed as a surprise because the district has more than 7,000 soldiers and 2,000 police officers, who were seen as likely to favor an ex-general.[1] His discussion in the Myanmar Parliament (2015-2020) to amend the National Constitution has been considered as a notable step to peacefully remove the Military from inappropriate involvement in Myanmar politics and re-establish as a proper professional army for national defense.
