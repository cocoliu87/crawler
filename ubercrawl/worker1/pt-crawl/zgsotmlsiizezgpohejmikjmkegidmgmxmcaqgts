The Northeast is one of the four regions defined by the U.S. Census Bureau for the collection and analysis of statistics.[1] The United States Census Bureau defines the region as encompassing the six New England states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut in addition to the three northern Mid-Atlantic states of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Some expanded definitions extend south into Maryland, Delaware, Washington, D.C., and northern parts of Virginia. The region is home to the Northeast megalopolis, which includes many of the nation's largest metropolitan areas, including Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. The megalopolis makes up 67% of the region's total population of 57,609,148. The gross domestic product of the region was $5.1 trillion dollars as of 2022 and contains some of the most developed states based on the Human Development Index, with every state with the exception of Maine above the national average.[10][11] It is also the most densely populated region in the United States, with 320 people per square mile (120 people/km2).[12][13] The U.S. Census Bureau defines the Northeast United States as having a total area of 181,324 sq mi (469,630 km2), making it the smallest region of the United States by total area. History[edit] Indigenous people[edit] Main article: Indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands Anthropologists recognize the "Northeastern Woodlands" as one of the cultural regions that existed in the Western Hemisphere at the time of European colonists in the 15th and later centuries. Most did not settle in North America until the 17th century. The cultural area, known as the "Northeastern Woodlands", in addition to covering the entire Northeast U.S., also covered much of what is now Canada and others regions of what is now the eastern United States.[14] Among the many tribes inhabiting this area were those that made up the Iroquois nations and the numerous Algonquian peoples.[15] In the United States of the 21st century, 18 federally recognized tribes reside in the Northeast.[16] For the most part, the people of the Northeastern Woodlands, on whose lands European fishermen began camping to dry their codfish in the early 1600s, lived in villages, especially after being influenced by agricultural traditions of the Ohio and Mississippi valley societies.[17] Colonial history[edit] Main article: History of New England Embarkation of the Pilgrims, an 1857 portrait by Robert Walter Weir Penn's Treaty with the Indians, a 1772 portrait by Benjamin West All of the U.S. states making up the Northeastern region were among the original Thirteen Colonies, though Maine and Vermont were part of other colonies before the United States became independent in the American Revolution. The two cultural and geographic regions that form parts of the Northeastern region have distinct histories. The first European explorer known to have explored the Atlantic shoreline of the Northeast since the Norse was Giovanni da Verrazzano in 1524. His ship La Dauphine explored the coast from what is now known as Florida to New Brunswick. The first Europeans to settle and colonize New England were Pilgrims from England, who landed in present-day Massachusetts in 1620.[18] The Pilgrims arrived on the ship Mayflower and founded Plymouth Colony so they could practice religion freely.[18] Ten years later, a larger group of Puritans settled north of Plymouth Colony in Boston to form Massachusetts Bay Colony.[19] In 1636, colonists established Connecticut Colony and Providence Plantations.[20][21] Providence was founded by Roger Williams, who was banished by Massachusetts for his beliefs in freedom of religion, and it was the first colony to guarantee all citizens freedom of worship.[21] Anne Hutchinson, who was also banished by Massachusetts, formed the town of Portsmouth.[21] Providence, Portsmouth and two other towns (Newport and Warwick) consolidated to form the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.[21] Henry Hudson explored the area of present-day New York in 1609 and claimed it for the Netherlands. His journey stimulated Dutch interest, and the area became known as New Netherland. In 1625, the city of New Amsterdam (the location of present-day New York City) was designated the capital of the province.[22] The Dutch New Netherland settlement along the Hudson River and, for a time, the New Sweden settlement along the Delaware River divided the English settlements in the north and the south. In 1664, Charles II of England formally annexed New Netherland and incorporated it into the English colonial empire.[23] The territory became the colonies of New York and New Jersey.[23] New Jersey was originally split into East Jersey and West Jersey until the two were united as a royal colony in 1702.[23] New England played a prominent role in early American education. Starting in the 17th century, the larger towns in New England opened grammar schools, the forerunner of the modern high school.[citation needed] The first public school in the English colonies was the Boston Latin School, founded in 1635.[24] In 1636, the colonial legislature of Massachusetts founded Harvard College, the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States.[25] In 1681, William Penn, who wanted to give Quakers a land of religious freedom, founded Pennsylvania and extended freedom of religion to all citizens.[26] Penn strongly desired access to the sea for his Pennsylvania Province and leased what then came to be known as the "Lower Counties on the Delaware" from the Duke.[27] Penn established representative government and briefly combined his two possessions under one General Assembly in 1682. However, by 1704 the Province of Pennsylvania had grown so large that their representatives wanted to make decisions without the assent of the Lower Counties and the two groups of representatives began meeting on their own, one at Philadelphia, and the other at New Castle, Delaware. Penn and his heirs remained proprietors of both and always appointed the same person Governor for their Province of Pennsylvania and their territory of the Lower Counties. The fact that Delaware and Pennsylvania shared the same governor was not unique. From 1703 to 1738, both New York and New Jersey shared a governor.[28] Massachusetts and New Hampshire also shared a governor for some time.[29] American Revolution[edit] Further information: American Revolution and American Revolutionary War The Battle of Trenton, fought in New Jersey in December 1776 following Washington's covert crossing of the Delaware during the night of December 25, 1776, represented an inspiring victory for Washington's Continental Army and began to turn the Revolutionary War in the Americans' favor. The beginnings of the American Revolutionary War would be in the Northeast, specifically in Massachusetts. The Battles of Lexington and Concord in northeast of Boston would be the first military engagements between the Revolutionaries and the British.[30] Many of the major battles of the revolution would be fought in the Northeast. The British would evacuate Boston in early-1776 and would move to capture New York City.[31] The revolutionaries would be pushed to the Delaware River before suddenly moving forward against the British in the Battles of Trenton and Princeton.[31] After a stalemate started between the British and American Revolutionaries starting in 1778 and would continue until the end of the war in 1783.[32] The war would move to southern states and eventually conclude with the Battle of Yorktown in Virginia.[31] Formation of the United States of America[edit] The idea of an independent United States of America, with the designs of its government would be created primarily in the Northeast in a series of declarations, constitutions, and documents. The Continental Congresses would meet in Philadelphia, which would produce the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation. Following the American Revolution, the capital of the newly formed United States would move around in the states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York. It would remain in New York City from 1785 until 1790, when it would move to Philadelphia. It would finally move to a new location in Washington D.C. in 1800.[33] The Constitutional Convention would be held in Philadelphia to draft the new United States Constitution in 1787.[34] 6 of the first 13 states to ratify t contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 60 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Northeastern_United_States responseCode 3 200
