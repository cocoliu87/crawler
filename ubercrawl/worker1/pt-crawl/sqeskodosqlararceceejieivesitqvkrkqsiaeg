These negotiations were aimed at forming a governing coalition after the 2023 Spanish general election.[1][2] Alberto Núñez Feijóo's People's Party (PP), failed to form a government as they could not muster enough support to reach a parliamentary majority. After Feijóo failed in his investiture vote, King Felipe VI instructed Sánchez with the task of forming a government.[3] After a careful counting of the votes and the distribution of seats, it became clear that the only possibility for Sánchez to be able to govern was for Junts (with seven seats in Congress at the time) to vote in his favor.[4][5] Junts had not supported him in the formation of previous governments, having voted against him in his July 2019 and January 2020 investiture votes.[6][7] The starting position of Junts and Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) in negotiations were the amnesty of all participants in the 2017 Catalan independence referendum, and the possibility of holding a new referendum. Catalan Civil Society (SCC) called a demonstration for 8 October, in response to a potential amnesty.[8] On 28 October Sánchez discussed the amnesty proposal at a PSOE Federal Committee, as part of government formation negotiations.[9][10] Timeline[edit] Preventive demonstrations against the amnesty in Madrid on 24 September 2023 (top) and in Barcelona on 8 October 2023 (bottom) The People's Party (PP) called their first protest against a possible amnesty for the Catalan pro-independence supporters by Sánchez before Alberto Núñez Feijóo presented himself for investiture.[11] The protest took place in the Plaza de Felipe II in Madrid on the morning of September 24.[12][13] Feijóo was supported by former presidents José María Aznar and Mariano Rajoy, as well as by other PP barons such as Almeida and Ayuso.[11][12][14] A delegation of the government of the Community of Madrid estimated that more than 40,000 people attended the event, while the PP put the number at 60,000. There was no official confirmation of the number who attended. [12][14] The acting vice-president Yolanda Díaz said about this event that the "proposal of the right wing is to set fire to Catalonia", while the president of the Generalitat of Catalonia, Pere Aragonès, said that the meeting of the PP was "a demonstration of hatred and revenge against Catalonia".[15] 28 October[edit] Signs of protesters criticizing Pedro Sánchez and the Catalan independence movement at the SCC demonstration in Barcelona, 8 October 2023 Before negotiations by Sánchez to form a government, SCC called a demonstration in Barcelona against the amnesty proposal.[16] Núñez Feijóo and Isabel Díaz Ayuso attended, while the First Secretary of the Socialists' Party of Catalonia (PSC–PSOE), Salvador Illa, accused Feijóo and Santiago Abascal, leader of Vox, of "generating fear" while assuring that "Spain is not going to break".[8][16] 29 October[edit] After the amnesty was announced to be forming part of negotiations to form a Sánchez led government, a protest organised by a group linked to the Vox party took place in the Plaza de Colón in Madrid.
