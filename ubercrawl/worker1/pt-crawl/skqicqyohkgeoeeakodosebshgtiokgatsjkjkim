Nicknamed the Black Caps (Māori: Pōtae Pango),[13] they played their first Test in 1930 against England in Christchurch, becoming the fifth country to play Test cricket. From 1930 New Zealand had to wait until 1956, more than 26 years, for its first Test victory, against the West Indies at Eden Park in Auckland.[14] They played their first ODI in the 1972–73 season against Pakistan in Christchurch. New Zealand are the inaugural champions of WTC which they won in 2021 and they have also won ICC CT in 2000. They have played in the CWC final twice and the T20 WC final once. Kane Williamson is the current captain of the team in ODIs and T20Is, Tim Southee is the current test captain as Kane Williamson stepped down as captain in December 2022. The national team is organized by New Zealand Cricket. The New Zealand cricket team became known as the Blackcaps in January 1998, after its sponsor at the time, Clear Communications, held a competition to choose a name for the team.[15] This is one of many national team nicknames related to the All Blacks. As of 21 September 2023, New Zealand have played 1472 international matches, out of which they have won 584, lost 654, tied 17 and drew 170 matches while 47 matches ended up as no result.[16] The team is ranked 5th in Tests, 6th in ODIs and 4th in T20Is by the ICC.[17] As of 2022, the team has participated in all the 29 ICC Men's events taking place from 1975 onwards and have made six final appearances out of which they won two titles. In October 2000 they won the Knockout Trophy by defeating India which was their maiden ICC Title. They defeated South Africa to reach their maiden CWC Final in 2015.[18] In the next edition they reached their second successive Final by defeating India.[19] Then in June 2021 they won the inaugural WTC by defeating India and five months later they reached their maiden T20 WC Final by defeating England. History[edit] Beginnings of cricket in New Zealand[edit] See also: History of cricket in New Zealand to 1890 The reverend Henry Williams provided history with the first report of a game of cricket in New Zealand, when he wrote in his diary in December 1832 about boys in and around Paihia on Horotutu Beach playing cricket. In 1835, Charles Darwin and HMS Beagle called into the Bay of Islands on its epic circumnavigation of the Earth and Darwin witnessed a game of cricket played by freed Māori slaves and the son of a missionary at Waimate North. Darwin in The Voyage of the Beagle wrote:[20] several young men redeemed by the missionaries from slavery were employed on the farm. In the evening I saw a party of them at cricket. The first recorded game of cricket in New Zealand took place in Wellington in December 1842. The Wellington Spectator reports a game on 28 December 1842 played by a "Red" team and a "Blue" team from the Wellington Club. The first fully recorded match was reported by the Examiner in Nelson between the Surveyors and Nelson in March 1844. The first team to tour New Zealand was Parr's all England XI in 1863–64. Between 1864 and 1914, 22 foreign teams toured New Zealand. England sent 6 teams, Australia 15 and one from Fiji. First national team[edit] See also: History of cricket in New Zealand from 1890–91 to 1918 On 15–17 February 1894 the first team representing New Zealand played New South Wales at Lancaster Park in Christchurch. New South Wales won by 160 runs. New South Wales returned again in 1895–96 and New Zealand won the solitary game by 142 runs, its first victory. The New Zealand Cricket Council was formed towards the end of 1894. New Zealand played its first two internationals (not Tests) in 1904–05 against a star-studded Australia team containing such players as Victor Trumper, Warwick Armstrong and Clem Hill. Rain saved New Zealand from a thrashing in the first match, but not the second, which New Zealand lost by an innings and 358 runs – currently the second-largest defeat in New Zealand first-class history. Inter-war period[edit] See also: History of cricket in New Zealand from 1918–19 to 1945 In 1927 NZ toured England. They played 26 first-class matches, mostly against county sides. They won seven matches, including those against Worcestershire, Glamorgan, Somerset and Derbyshire. On the strength of the performances of this tour New Zealand was granted Test status. In 1929/30 the M.C.C toured NZ and played 4 Tests all of 3 days in duration. New Zealand lost its first Test match but drew the next 3. In the second Test Stewie Dempster and Jackie Mills put on 276 for the first wicket. This is still the highest partnership for New Zealand against England. New Zealand first played South Africa in 1931–32 in a three match series but were unable to secure Test matches against any teams other than England before World War II ended all Test cricket for 7 years. A Test tour by Australia, planned for February and March 1940, was cancelled after the outbreak of the war.[21][22][23] After World War II[edit] See also: History of cricket in New Zealand from 1945–46 to 1970 New Zealand's first Test after the war was against Australia in 1945/46. This game was not considered a "Test" at the time but it was granted Test status retrospectively by the International Cricket Council in March 1948. The New Zealand players who appeared in this match probably did not appreciate this move by the ICC as New Zealand were dismissed for 42 and 54. The New Zealand Cricket Council's unwillingness to pay Australian players a decent allowance to tour New Zealand ensured that this was the only Test Australia played against New Zealand between 1929 and 1972. In 1949 New Zealand sent one of its best-ever sides to England. It contained Bert Sutcliffe, Martin Donnelly, John R. Reid and Jack Cowie. However, 3-day Test matches ensured that all 4 Tests were drawn. Many have regarded the 1949 tour of England among New Zealand's best ever touring performances. All four tests were high-scoring despite being draws and Martin Donnelly's 206 at Lord's hailed as one of the finest innings ever seen there.[24] Despite being winless, New Zealand did not lose a test either. Prior to this, only the legendary 1948 Australian team, led by the great Don Bradman, had achieved this. New Zealand played its first matches against the West Indies in 1951–52, and Pakistan and India in 1955/56. In 1954/55 New Zealand recorded the lowest ever innings total, 26 against England. The following season New Zealand achieved its first Test victory. The first 3 Tests of a 4 Test series were won easily by the West Indies but New Zealand won the fourth to notch up its first Test victory. It had taken them 45 matches and 26 years to attain. 9, 10, 12, 13 March 1956 Scorecard New Zealand v West Indies 255 all out (166.5 overs) John R. Reid 84 Tom Dewdney 5/21 (19.5 overs) 145 all out (78.3 overs) Hammond Furlonge 64 Harry Cave 4/22 (27.3 overs) 157 all out (80 overs) Sammy Guillen 41 Denis Atkinson 7/53 (40 overs) 77 all out (45.1 overs) Everton Weekes 31 Harry Cave 4/21 (13.1 overs) New Zealand won by 190 runs Eden Park, Auckland Umpires: Clyde Harris (NZL) and Terry Pearce (NZL) New Zealand won the toss and chose to bat In the next 20 years, New Zealand won only seven more Tests. For most of this period New Zealand lacked a class bowler to lead their attack although they had two excellent batsmen in Bert Sutcliffe and Glenn Turner and a great all-rounder in John R. Reid. Reid captained New Zealand on a tour to South Africa in 1961–62 where the five-test series was drawn 2–2. The victories in the third and fifth tests were the first overseas victories New Zealand achieved. Reid scored 1,915 runs in the tour, setting a record for the most runs scored by a touring batsman of South Africa as a result.[25] New Zealand won their first test series in their three match 1969/70 tour of Pakistan 1–0.[26] This was the first ever series win by New Zealand after almost 40 years and 30 consecutive winless series.[27] 1970 to 2000[edit] See also: History of cricket in New Zealand from 1970-71 to 2000 Scoreboard - Basin ReserveFebruary 1978.
