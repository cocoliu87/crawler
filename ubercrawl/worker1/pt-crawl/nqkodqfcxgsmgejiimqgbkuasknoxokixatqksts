Rider on the Tjängvide Stone, interpreted as Odin on Sleipnir. The horse in Nordic mythology is the most important animal in terms of its role, both in the texts, Eddas and saga, and in representations and cults. Almost always named, the horse is associated with the gods Æsir and Vanir, with heroes or their enemies in Nordic mythology. The horse is more than just a means of transport, as it is at the heart of numerous fertility rituals in connection with the god Freyr. Closely associated with the cosmogony of the ancient Germanic-Scandinavians and with profound shamanic symbolism, this psychopomp is entrusted with the task of carrying the dead to Valhalla. The horse pulls the chariot of the sun and moon and lights up the world with its mane. It is linked to many vital elements, such as light, air, water and fire. The male horse is also highly valued in comparison with the mare. This importance in the founding texts and sagas reflects the high value of the horse among Nordic peoples, as also attested by the rituals linked to its sacrifice, the consumption of its meat or the use of its body parts, reputed to bring protection and fertility. His bones were used as instruments of black magic in the sagas. Demonizing and combating equestrian traditions and rituals, such as hippophagy, was a key element in the Christianization of the Nordic regions of Germania, Scandinavia and Iceland. Generalities[edit] In archaeology, as in Prose Edda, the horse is the most important animal in Nordic mythology.[1] Sacrificial horses associated with deities are among the oldest archaeological finds in these regions.[2] The texts reflect the society and customs of the time, clearly showing, according to Marc-André Wagner, that the horse was considered a "double of man" and a "form of the powers", both in the founding texts, rites and mentality of the Germans.[3] This is due to a worldview based on the perception of nature, which is at the origin of the myths. Horses (like gods, plants and people) embody the forces of the cosmos and nature.[4] In 1930, W. Steller postulated the existence of an original Germanic horse-god.[5] The first real study on the subject was Gutorm Gjessing's Hesten i forhistorisk kunst og kultus (1943), in which he develops the idea of the horse as an ancient symbol of fertility in Nordic mythology, in connection with the god Freyr. Secondly, he saw a connection with the Odinic cult of warrior death.[6] Horses in texts[edit] Written sources come mainly from the Prose Edda and the Poetic Edda, but also from the saga. Although they do not always contain many mythological elements, they do provide a precise idea of the cults paid to this animal and its importance for the ancient German-Scandinavians, and hence the reasons for its place in the founding texts. The Nafnaþulur, a form of mnemonic enumeration in Snorri Sturluson's prose Edda, provide a large number of horse names: Hrafn, Sleipnir, Valr, Lettfeti, Tjaldari, Gulltoppr, Goti, Soti, Mor, Lungr, Marr, Vigg, Stuffr, Skaevadr, Blakkr, Thegn, Silfrtoppr, Fakr, Gullfaxi, Jor, and Blóðughófi.[7] Horses of the Aesir gods[edit] See also: Æsir First page of manuscript ÍB 299 4to of the Prose Edda, showing Odin, Heimdall and Sleipnir, among others. Horses belonging to the Aesir gods are mentioned in the Grímnismál (30) and in the Gylfaginning (15). Gulltopp is attributed to the god Heimdall in Baldrs draumar, where the god rides this animal as part of the funeral procession to celebrate Baldr's cremation.[8][9] In the Grímnismál[edit] See also: Grímnismál The eddic poem Grímnismál cites the following names: Glad and Gyllir, Gler and Skeidbrimir, Sillfrintopp and Sinir, Gisl and Falhofnir, Gulltopp and Lettfeti; On these mounts the Aesir Ride every day When they go to council, At the root of Yggdrasill. -Grímnismál (30)[10] In the Gylfaginning[edit] See also: Gylfaginning The Gylfaginning, in Snorri Sturluson's prose Edda, repeats this list, adding Sleipnir "He who glides", Odin's eight-legged horse; and Glen or Glenr.[Note 1] Every day, the Aesir ride over the Bifröst bridge, also known as the Aesir Bridge. Here are the names of the Aesir horses: Sleipnir is the best, belonging to Odin and having eight legs. The second is Gladr, the third Gyllir, the fourth Glenr, the fifth Skeidbrimir, the sixth Silfrintoppr, the seventh Sinir, the eighth Gisl, the ninth Falhófnir, the tenth Gulltoppr, the eleventh Léttfeti. Baldr's horse was burned with him; and Thor walks to judgment. — Gylfaginning (15)[11] Odin and his horse Sleipnir, from a drawing by Arthur Rackham. Sleipnir[edit] See also: Sleipnir Sleipnir holds a very special place in mythological texts, being both the best described and most frequently mentioned of the Aesir horses. Sleipnir means "glider".[12] It appears in Grímnismál,[13] Sigrdrífumál,[14] Baldrs draumar,[15] Hyndluljóð[16] and Skáldskaparmál.[17] This eight-legged animal could move over the sea as well as in the air, and was the son of the god Loki and the powerful stallion Svaðilfari.[18] "Best of all horses" and fastest of all, according to Snorri Sturluson,[19] he became Odin's mount, riding him to the region of Hel and lending him to his messenger Hermóðr to accomplish the same journey;[20] however, the god used him mainly to cross the Bifröst bridge to reach the third root of Yggdrasil, where the council of the gods was held. The Prose Edda gives many details on the circumstances of Sleipnir's birth, and specifies, for example, that he is gray in color. He is also the ancestor of the Grani horse. Other divine and cosmogonic horses[edit] The wolves pursue the moon chariot, Máni, and the sun chariot, Sól, pulled by Árvakr and Alsviðr. Gná and his horse Hófvarpnir, next to Frigg's throne. Illustration from 1882 by Carl Emil Doepler. Main articles: Árvakr and Alsviðr, Svaðilfari, Skinfaxi and Hrímfaxi, and Gullfaxi Nótt riding Hrímfaxi, from a 19th-century painting by Peter Nicolai Arbo. The giant master builder and his horse Svadilfari. Other horses linked to divinities or playing a role in cosmogony are mentioned in Nordic mythology. The Gylfaginning (35) reveals the origin of Sleipnir and mentions the horse Svadilfari at length. The horse was also frequently the object of admiration in the Poetic Edda, for its shape and speed. Kennings have been found comparing ships and horses, notably in the Poetic Edda, section of the Song of Sigurd, the Dragon Slayer (16). Árvakr and Alsviðr ("Early riser" and "Very swift") are the two horses that pull the goddess Sól's chariot across the sky every day,[21][22] their manes emitting daylight. Skinfaxi and Hrímfaxi ("Shining mane" and "Mane of frost") are, according to Snorri Sturluson, two other cosmogonic horses. One belongs to the personification of night, Nótt, who rides him during the night, the other to the personification of day, Dagr, who rides him during the day.[22] The first drools foam that becomes morning dew, while the second lights up the world with its mane.[23] In the Nafnaþulur of the Prose Edda, Blóðughófi, sometimes anglicized as Blodughofi "bloody hoof",[24] was a horse capable of passing through fire and darkness, and belonged to Freyr.[25][26] In the Skírnismál of the Poetic Edda, Freyr gave Skírnir a horse capable of running through fire to Jötunheimr to meet the giantess Gerðr; the animal was not named, but it was most likely Blóðughófi.[27] Gullfaxi ("Golden Mane") was, in Skáldskaparmál (17), a horse originally belonging to the giant Hrungnir. After defeating the giant, Thor gave it to his son Magni as a reward for his help.[17] Hófvarpnir "He who throws his hooves"[Note 2][28][29] or "He who kicks his hooves"[30] was the horse of the goddess Gná, capable of moving through the air and over the sea.[30] Mentioned in the Prose Edda, he was the son of Hamskerpir[Note 3] and Garðrofa, "Breaker of Fences".[31] I don't fly Though I think To cross the skies Over Hofvarpnir The one Hamskerpir had With Garðrofa -Gylfaginning (35)[32] Jacob Grimm noted that Gná was not considered a winged goddess, but that her mount Hófvarpnir may have been a winged horse, like Pegasus in Greek mythology.[33] John Lindow added that Hamskerpir and Garðrofa are totally unknown to other sources of Nordic mythology, and that if they had an associated myth, it may not have survived.[31] Svadilfari or Svaðilfari[Note 4] "He who makes arduous journeys,"[29][34] or "He who makes unhappy journeys"[35] is the stallion who begot Sleipnir with Loki transformed into a mare according to the Hyndluljód (40). Snorri's Gylfaginning (42) states that he belongs to the giant master builder and contributed to the construction of Asgard.[19] The Valkyrie horses are described in the Helgakvida Hjörvardssonar: Quand les chevaux dressaient la tête, la rosée, de leurs crinières tombait dans les vallées profondes — Helgakvida Hjörvardssonar (28)[36] This description recalls Hrimfaxi.[37] Horses of heroes and sagas[edit] See also: Grani Grani based on an illustration by Fredrik Sander in a Swedish edition of the Poetic Edda in 1893. The horse features prominently in the sagas and heroic tales of the Poetic Edda. In the Swedish saga of the Ynglingar, the king can give three very precious things, which are, in order: a good horse, a golden saddle and a fine ship.[38] Freyfaxi, "Freyr's Mane", is the horse dedicated to the god Freyr, belonging to the protagonist of the Hrafnkell saga. He had sworn that he alone would ride it, and that he would kill anyone who tried to climb onto it. The breaking of this oath is a major plot element in the saga. When his neighbour's son rides Freyfaxi to retrieve his runaway sheep, Hrafnkell remains true to his oath and kills him.[39] Grani  contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 63 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/The_horse_in_Nordic_mythology responseCode 3 200
