He last served as the Deputy Chief of the Indian Army Staff (Personnel & Systems). After retirement, he served for some time as an administrative member on the bench of the Armed Forces Tribunal. He was the Vice-Chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University.[1] Early life and education[edit] Zameer Uddin Shah is an alumnus of St Joseph's College, Nainital. He is the brother of noted Indian actor Naseeruddin Shah. General Shah holds a Master of Science degree in Defence Science from the University of Madras and a Master of Philosophy degree from the Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya University, Indore.[2] Military career[edit] Shah attended the National Defence Academy in Khadakwasla, Pune. He was commissioned with the 185 Light Regiment (Camel Pack) on 9 June 1968. He also commanded 170 Medium Regiment (Veer Rajputs). Shah was later the Colonel Commandant of the Regiment of Artillery. He was also the Indian military attaché to Saudi Arabia.[3] He led the Army during the Gujarat riots of 2002.[4] Vice-Chancellor of AMU[edit] Shah was the Vice-Chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University from 2012 to 2017.[5] From 2010 to 2015, Shah's appointment as the Vice-Chancellor of the university was the subject of a petition in the Allahabad High Court as the regulations of UGC state that Vice-Chancellors of a university are required to work as a professor in a university or in an equivalent post in an academic institute for at least 10 years before they can be appointed to the position in any Institute. The High Court dismissed their petition and allowed him to stay in his position, however petitioners later made an appeal to the Supreme Court.[6] In September 2016, the Supreme Court questioned the appointment of Shah as the vice chancellor of the university[7] and asserted that all universities in the country have to follow the rules prescribed in the UGC,[8] however he was allowed to serve in his position until the expiration of his term in May 2017. The petition was supported by a number of people and lobbies associated with the university who had also alleged that Shah's appointment, as well as many of the decisions made by him after coming to power, were a result of corruption.[8] Controversies[edit] In 2014, Shah banned girls from accessing the Maulana Azad Library, saying that the library would have, "four times more boys," if undergraduate girls were allowed to enter the library and that the library was already, "cramped for space." His comments were widely criticized and drew a response from the Indian Minister of Education, Smriti Irani, who was quoted as saying, "AMU VC's reported remark not only hurts as a woman but also agitates." Irani termed the remark an, "insult to daughters." The Ministry of Education also sought a response from the university.[9] He was also summoned by the Allahabad High Court, which labelled the ban a "case of gender-based bias." The Court directed him to take adequate measures to ensure the safety of women attending the library.[10] Shah later claimed that his comments were stretched out of proportion.[11] He later banned reporters from The Times of India, which first reported the library ban, from entering the campus of the university.[12][13] Shah has also attributed the "backwardness" of Muslims to keeping their women "enslaved" and not working during Ramzan.[14] Bibliography[edit] Shah, Zameer Uddin (2018).
