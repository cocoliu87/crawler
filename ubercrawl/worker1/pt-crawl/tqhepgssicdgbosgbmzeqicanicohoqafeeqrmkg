Groble (talk) 06:01, 25 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] This proposal should be raised at WP:ITN, as the entry is posted through ITN. Carter00000 (talk) 16:09, 25 September 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] If the bar for "extreme note" is that low to the point where most countries have no mandates in place for it anymore and almost no one wears a mask for it, then in that case the HIV/AIDS pandemic, flu season, the tuberculosis epidemic, and the obesity epidemic should also be there.

Carter00000 (talk) 16:45, 12 October 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Unverified stories[edit] Should it be included in the summary whether or not a story has been verified or not? Why include unsubstantiated stories? 2600:1700:3AE1:50:1129:806F:6AD2:AEEC (talk) 12:24, 6 October 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] This is specifically in reference to the October 5 story about a Russian child killed in Horlivka by a Ukrainian munition. The Al Jazeera news feed which is given as the source states that the story could not be verified. 2600:1700:3AE1:50:1129:806F:6AD2:AEEC (talk) 12:59, 6 October 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] On the "Ongoing" Section[edit] Complete overhaul. Something like Ongoing events : 2023 Nigerien crisis, Flight of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians Ongoing conflicts : Yemen War, Syria War, Ukraine war, Sudan War Recent deaths : Lukt64 (talk) 00:09, 12 October 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] This proposal should be raised at WP:ITN, as the entries proposed are posted through ITN.

Carter00000 (talk) 16:26, 12 October 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Completly agree. As well, why was the War in Sudan removed? it is a high-impact conflict. Affiliating (talk) 17:57, 17 October 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Not enough activity on the page. Lukt64 (talk) 18:03, 17 October 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] War crimes in the 2023 Israel–Hamas war[edit] There should maybe be a consideration if there's enough consensus to just start avoiding the use of "War crimes in the 2023 Israel–Hamas war" header because of how it incentivizes gaming whether or not play-by-play back and forth events if each one is evaluated as being considered a war crime or not by Wikipedia's editors, which seems problematic and against the spirit of the discretionary sanctions on the Israeli-Palestinian and Arab-Israeli conflicts. I've already seen what seems to me to be worrying trends toward arms races of pushing stories in and out of the "War Crimes" grouping to control which events are being called war crimes in this hotly contested and developing scenario... I do think war crimes are being committed but a lot is going on and I don't think we can all keep up with it to the level of very careful accuracy that it should be at this time... but that's just my one opinion so far, not trying to be disruptive or anything. Sumstream (talk) 17:13, 9 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Those events should just be included under the general "2023 Israel-Hamas War" label to avoid passing judgement on if it is a war crime. For many of these, there is not enough info to know if it was a war crime or not, so it should not be definitely stated with a "war crimes" header, which makes it seem like it is known as an undisputed fact that the event was a war crime. Some of these, such as condemnations by NGOs or other governments, should also be in the reactions section instead. Folohsor (talk) 18:24, 11 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Agree get rid of the "War crimes" section entirely, its hilariously/horrifically biased; most of the sources are Al Jazeera (Qatar state-owned media; Qatar is an authoritarian state with no press freedom, and it's a primary Hamas funder, sponsor, and supporter and hosts their leader in Doha among high society) or literal Palestinian groups' statements. The "misinformation" section also seems to be entirely anti-Israel every day from what I've seen. And I know we have WP:NOTRIGHT and most sources are anti-Israel, but its outrageous. TBH maybe it should go to the neutrality noticeboard or get an RFC.
