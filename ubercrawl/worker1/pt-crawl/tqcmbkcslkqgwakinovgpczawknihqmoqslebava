NP Patrol is now at Wikipedia:New pages patrol. Wikipedia information page This is an information page. It is not one of Wikipedia's policies or guidelines, but rather intends to describe some aspect(s) of Wikipedia's norms, customs, technicalities, or practices. It may reflect varying levels of consensus and vetting. Shortcut WP:RCP Recent changes patrol, or RC patrol, is a volunteer-led patrol whereby individual users check the recent changes of various articles for inappropriate edits. The patrol is entirely voluntary and carries no obligation. At its heart, it is really just a way to try to ensure that every edited article gets checked in a timely manner and is given a boost on its way to becoming a "featured article", while simultaneously ensuring that Wikipedia is not harmed by unconstructive edits. Recent Changes Patroller badge Things to review Copyvios New pages New files New editors IP edits Discussions Recent changes Patrol Userbox Regular RC patrollers may wish to put the RC patrol userbox on their user page by adding {{User wikipedia/RC Patrol}} to their user pages. This user is a recent changes patroller. Recent changes Patrol Topicon Regular RC patrollers may wish to put the RC patrol topicon on their user page by adding {{RC patroller topicon}} to their user pages. (A little RCP badge will be displayed in the same way as it does here, in the top-right corner. See?) What to do RC patrolling primarily consists of a four-step process: Identify "bad" or "needy" edits RC patrollers efficiently identify problematic edits using the tools described below. A bad edit is an edit that, for one reason or another, may need to be entirely removed. A needy edit requires maintenance or improvement in some manner. Remove or improve the edit Needy edits should be tagged according to their need, or boldly changed immediately. A useful list of tags can be found at WP:TC. Bad edits should likewise be tagged or deleted. Because Wikipedians do not like their edits to be deleted, it is important to leave concise but clear justifications on the talk page or in the edit summary. When adding tags, please consider discussing the issue on the article's talk page before adding them in the article itself. Warn the editor In the cases of deliberate vandalism or an evident lack of knowledge on Wikipedia procedure, offending editors should be warned on their talk pages. While this is an optional step, the Wikipedia:Guide to administrator intervention against vandalism says that a final warning should always be given before reporting a vandal, and warnings should be a regular part of a patroller's duties, as it minimizes conflict, educates new editors and alerts administrators of repeat offenders. For efficiency and consistency, standard warning templates can be used. However, do feel free to simply write a warning if the available templates are not appropriate. Check the user's other contributions You will often find more edits with similar problems. As an RC patroller, you may want to fix those as well. Being nice to others See also: Wikipedia:IPs are human too Throughout the entire process of RC patrol, it is important to remember not to bite the newcomers. A 2006 essay indicated that newcomers, far from being a monolithic horde of vandals, trolls and spammers, wrote most of Wikipedia's content.[1] If you see a new user or IP address contributing, welcome them if you're so inclined, and include a pointer or two of feedback about how they can make their contributions even better. Most will welcome the support. It is also important to assume good faith as much as possible, or minimally to assume incompetence or lack of experience instead of malice. For example, remember not everyone is as computer-literate as you; some people will accidentally blank or damage pages when attempting to cut and paste material from Wikipedia. Others may not understand that, yes, their changes really are visible to the entire world immediately. Patrolling edits to existing pages See also: Wikipedia:Template messages/User talk namespace One thing to keep in mind is to not only focus on patrolling articles in the main namespace but also to check other pages â€” such as, for example, image pages, which are frequently victims of nonsensical edits and vandalism. Such unchecked edits may be particularly harmful because the result might be removal of copyright tags. Newcomer tests Look for newcomer tests (odd edits which are not vandalism), but do not bite the newcomers. Revert their experiments and leave one of the following messages on their user talk page. Be sure to sign and timestamp (~~~~) the warning. You can use tools such as Twinkle or RedWarn to revert the page and issue the warning faster. {{subst:uw-test1}} ~~~~ Hello, I'm Example. An edit that you recently made seemed to be a test and has been reverted. If you want to practice editing, please use the sandbox. If you think a mistake was made, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on my talk page. Thanks! ~~~~ {{subst:uw-create1}} ~~~~ Welcome to Wikipedia. A page you recently created may not conform to some of Wikipedia's guidelines for new pages, so it will be removed shortly (if it hasn't been already). Please use the sandbox for any tests, and consider using the Article Wizard. For more information about creating articles, you may want to read Your first article. You may also want to read our introduction page to learn more about contributing. Thank you. ~~~~ {{subst:uw-delete1}} ~~~~ (a variant suitable for blanking) Hello, I'm Example. I noticed that you recently removed content without adequately explaining why. In the future, it would be helpful to others if you described your changes to Wikipedia with an accurate edit summary. If this was a mistake, don't worry; the removed content has been restored. If you would like to experiment, please use the sandbox. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on my talk page. Thanks. ~~~~ {{subst:uw-test2}} ~~~~ Please refrain from making test edits in Wikipedia pages, even if you intend to fix them later. Your edits have been reverted. If you would like to experiment again, please use the sandbox. Thank you. ~~~~ {{subst:uw-delete2}} ~~~~ Please do not remove content or templates from pages on Wikipedia without giving a valid reason for the removal in the edit summary. Your content removal does not appear to be constructive and has been reverted. If you only meant to make a test edit, please use the sandbox for that. Thank you. ~~~~ Lack of sources Addition of unsourced material without proper citations {{subst:uw-unsor1}} ~~~~ Hello, I'm Example. I noticed that you added or changed content in an article, but you didn't provide a reliable source. It's been removed and archived in the page history for now, but if you'd like to include a citation and re-add it, please do so. You can have a look at referencing for beginners. If you think I made a mistake, you can leave me a message on my talk page. Thank you. {{subst:uw-unsor2}} ~~~~ Please do not add or change content without citing a reliable source. Please review the guidelines at Wikipedia:Citing sources and take this opportunity to add references to the article. Thank you. {{subst:uw-unsor3}} ~~~~ Please stop your disruptive editing. If you continue to add unsourced or poorly sourced content, you may be blocked from editing. Further non-constructive edits sometimes can be viewed as vandalism, and dealt with as below. Emergencies Look for threats of harm. Sometimes, you encounter edits threatening harm to oneself or others while patrolling recent changes. If you do, please follow Wikipedia:Responding to threats of harm. Spam Look for spam. If it comes in the form of articles, nominate them for deletion with {{db-spam}}, place a Proposed Deletion tag on them with {{subst:prod|Your Reasons Here}}, or nominate them at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion. If a user is posting multiple links to a particular website in several articles, revert the edits. In either case, again notify the user with {{subst:uw-spam1}}. Copyright violations Look for copyright violations and revert them. As per the instructions at Wikipedia:Copyright problems, just revert pages to remove copyright violations. However, take care to indicate in the edit summary that this is what you are doing. If an entire article is a copyvio see the section on copyvios in the new pages section below. Vandalism Look out for vandalism, and revert it. It is often worthwhile to check the page history after reverting to make sure you have removed all the vandalism. Also, check the user contributions of the vandal - you will often find more malicious edits. Additionally, leave warning messages on the vandal's talk pages using the following system. Be sure to check discussion pages for possible explanations of edits. Warning templates Note that these templates do not need to be used sequentially. If the edit is clearly vandalism, use the template {{uw-vandalism1}} instead. For continuing severe vandalism, {{uw-vandalism2}} may be skipped and {{uw-vandalism3}} given straight after the first warning. If, however, you are not sure that the edit is vandalism, always start with {{uw-test1}}. If a user made such an edit and reverted it themselves, use a {{Uw-selfrevert}}. For extreme or extensive cases of vandalism committed by users who have received no prior warnings, {{uw-vandalism4im}} may be used. The ~~~~ in the templates below cause the time and your signature to be added to the warning. {{subst:Uw-selfrevert}} ~~~~ (use if an edit appears to be a reversion of a newcomer test) Welcome to Wikipedia.
