South Africa and Zimbabwe as co-hosts along with the top eight teams in the ICC ODI rankings as of 31 March 2027[4] will qualify directly for the competition, while the remaining four spots will be decided through global qualifier tournaments.[4] Although Namibia will co-host the competition for the first time, they will not be guaranteed a spot because they are not a full ICC member, and as a result they will have to go through the standard qualification pathway.[5] Means of qualification Date Venue Teams Qualified Host nation 16 November 2021 — 2 South Africa Zimbabwe ICC Men's ODI Team Rankings 31 March 2027 Various 8 2026 Cricket World Cup Qualifier — TBD 4 Total 14 Format[edit] The competition will use two groups of seven, with the top three teams in each group progressing to a Super Six stage, followed by semi-finals and a final.
