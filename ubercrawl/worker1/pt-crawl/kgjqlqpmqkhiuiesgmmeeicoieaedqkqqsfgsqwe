A coup d'état in Myanmar began on the morning of 1 February 2021, when democratically elected members of the country's ruling party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), were deposed by the Tatmadaw—Myanmar's military—which then vested power in a military junta. Acting president Myint Swe proclaimed a year-long state of emergency and declared power had been transferred to Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Min Aung Hlaing. It declared the results of the November 2020 general election invalid and stated its intent to hold a new election at the end of the state of emergency.[10][11] The coup d'état occurred the day before the Parliament of Myanmar was due to swear in the members elected at the 2020 election, thereby preventing this from occurring.[12][13][14] President Win Myint and State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi were detained, along with ministers, their deputies, and members of Parliament.[15][16] On 3 February 2021, Win Myint and Aung San Suu Kyi were arrested on charges that independent analysts regarded as part of an attempt to legitimize the military’s seizure of power.[17][18] Both were remanded in custody for two weeks.[19][20][21] Between 16 February and 1 April, five additional charges were leveled against Aung San Suu Kyi.[22][23][24] Armed insurgencies by the People's Defence Force of the National Unity Government have erupted throughout Myanmar in response to the military government's crackdown on anti-coup protests.[25] As of 29 March 2022[update], at least 1,719 civilians, including children, have been killed by the junta forces and 9,984 arrested.[26] Three prominent NLD members also died while in police custody in March 2021,[27][28] and four pro-democracy activists were executed by the junta in July 2022.[29] Background[edit] The National League for Democracy won a landslide victory in the 2020 Myanmar general election. Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been beset with political instability since it was granted independence from the United Kingdom in January 1948. Between 1958 and 1960, the military formed a temporary caretaker government at the behest of U Nu, the country's democratically elected prime minister, to resolve political infighting.[30] The military voluntarily restored civilian government after holding the 1960 Burmese general election.[31] Less than two years later, the military seized power in the 1962 coup, which under the leadership of Ne Win, precipitated 26 years of military rule.[32] In 1988, nationwide protests broke out in the country. Dubbed the 8888 Uprising, the civil unrest was sparked by economic mismanagement, leading Ne Win to step down.[33] In September 1988, the military's top leaders formed the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), which then seized power.[33] Aung San Suu Kyi, the daughter of the country's modern founder Aung San, became a notable pro-democracy activist during this period. In 1990, free elections were allowed by the military, under the assumption that the military enjoyed popular support. Ultimately, the elections resulted in a landslide victory for Aung San Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy. However, the military refused to cede power and placed her under house arrest.[34][35][36] The military remained in power for another 22 years until 2011,[37] following the military's roadmap to democracy, during which the 2008 Constitution of Myanmar was drafted. Between 2011 and 2015, a tentative democratic transition began, and elections held in 2015 resulted in a victory for Aung San Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy (NLD). However, the military retained substantial power, including the right to appoint 1⁄4 of all parliament members.[15][38] The 2021 coup occurred in the aftermath of the general election on 8 November 2020, in which the NLD won 396 out of 476 seats in parliament, an even larger margin of victory than in the 2015 election. The military's proxy party, the Union Solidarity and Development Party, won only 33 seats.[15] The army disputed the results, claiming that the vote was fraudulent. The coup attempt had been rumored for several days, prompting statements of concern from Western nations such as the United Kingdom, France, the United States,[15] and Australia.[39] Unfolding of the coup[edit] February[edit] On 1 February 2021, NLD spokesman Myo Nyunt said that Aung San Suu Kyi, Win Myint, Han Tha Myint, and other party leaders had been "taken" in an early morning raid. Myo Nyunt added that he expected to be also detained shortly. Numerous communications channels stopped working – phone lines to the capital, Naypyidaw, were interrupted, state-run MRTV said it was unable to broadcast due to "technical issues",[40] and widespread Internet disruptions were reported beginning around 3 a.m.[41] The military disrupted cellular services throughout the country, mirroring "kill switch" tactics previously employed in combat zones in Chin and Rakhine states.[42] All the member banks under the Myanmar Banking Association suspended their financial services.[43] Around 400 elected members of parliament (MPs) were placed under house arrest, confined to a government housing complex in Naypyidaw.[44] Following the coup, the NLD arranged for the MPs to remain housed in the complex until 6 February.[45] Social media users began calling on MPs to convene a parliamentary session within a government guesthouse, since the group met the Constitution's quorum requirements.[45] In response, the military issued another order giving MPs 24 hours to leave the guesthouse premises.[45] On 4 February 70 NLD MPs took an oath of office, in clear defiance of the coup.[46] During the coup, soldiers also detained several Buddhist monks who had led the 2007 Saffron Revolution, including the Myawaddy Sayadaw and Shwe Nyar War Sayadaw, outspoken critics of the military.[47][48] 8888 Uprising activist leaders, including Mya Aye, were also arrested.[49] As of 4 February, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners had identified 133 officials and lawmakers and 14 civil society activists in detention by the military as a result of the coup.[47] Soldiers were seen in Naypyidaw and the largest city, Yangon.[50] The military subsequently announced on military-controlled Myawaddy TV that it had taken control of the country for one year.[51] A statement signed by acting president Myint Swe declared that responsibility for "legislation, administration and judiciary" had been transferred to Min Aung Hlaing.[52] The National Defence and Security Council – chaired by acting president Myint Swe and attended by top military officers – was convened, following which a statement was issued by the military declaring that fresh elections would be held, and that power would only be transferred after they had concluded.[53] The military also announced the removal of 24 ministers and deputies, for whom 11 replacements were named.[1] A military blockade of the road leading to the Mandalay Region Government Office.

On 2 February 2021, Min Aung Hlaing established the State Administration Council, with 11 members, as the executive governing body.[54][55] On 3 February 2021, Myanmar police filed criminal charges against Aung San Suu Kyi, accusing her of violating the Export and Import Law, for allegedly importing unlicensed communications devices used by her security detail, after conducting a raid on her home in the capital.[56][57][58][59] The Export and Import Law carries a potential prison term of 3 years and/or a fine, and was previously used in 2017 to prosecute journalists for flying a drone above the Assembly of the Union.[56][60] Meanwhile, Win Myint was charged with violating the Natural Disaster Management Law, specifically for waving at a passing NLD convoy in September 2020, thereby violating rules against election campaigning during the COVID-19 pandemic.[56] On 6 February 2021, Sean Turnell, the Australian economic advisor to the civilian government, was arrested.[61] On 8 February 2 contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 65 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/2021_Myanmar_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat responseCode 3 200
