Thanks. Archived discussion for August 2005 from Wikipedia:In the news section on the Main Page/Candidates. August 31 The death toll from Hurricane Katrina has exceeded 100 in Biloxi, Mississippi, and is expected to rise further. Deaths are expected to number in the several hundreds in New Orleans as that city is completely evacuated. --Kitch 11:29, 31 August 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Several hundred people have died after a stampede on a bridge in Baghdad. The railings of a bridge over the River Tigris gave way, and many people fell into the waters below. The cause is not known. (Wikinews) August 30 Hurricane Katrina devastates the U.S. Gulf Coast with strong wind and heavy rain, killing as least 70 people, as New Orleans, Louisiana and several nearby cities become submerged due to flooding. (Please shorten this if you can.) -- 199.71.174.100 11:26, 30 August 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] New Orleans, Louisiana declares martial law after levee breaks almost completely flood the city in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Gas leaks pollute the floodwaters. The American Red Cross states that the relief effort will exceed in scope that of the September 11, 2001 attacks. Up to 80 are dead in Biloxi, Mississippi, and death tolls are uncalculated in New Orleans. --Kitch 15:13, 30 August 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] The 2005 Forbes Global CEO Conference has kicked off in Sydney, Australia. Up to 10,000 protestors are expected. (Wikinews) Apply present tense: The 2005 Forbes Global CEO Conference in Sydney, Australia begins, with up to 10,000 anti-free trade demonstrators expected. (May or may not be big news till the protestors do something drastic.) -- 199.71.174.100 08:56, 30 August 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Police line in front of breached section of barricade Protestors did something drastic: Police arrest four at a barricade surrounding the Sydney Opera House as 2005 Forbes Global CEO Conference begins inside. (Wikinews) (Sydney Morning Herald via SMH.com.au) Four arrests isn't exactly major world news.--Pharos 10:02, 31 August 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] August 29 John Brogden, New South Wales Opposition Leader for the Liberal Party of Australia, resigns after accusing Helena Carr, the Malaysian-born wife of former NSW premier, Bob Carr, of being a "mail-order bride" and making unwanted sexual advances on several female journalists. This seems like local news to me, but what the heck ... This long blurb should be shortened. Details go to the article, not the Front Page. How about: Unacceptable remarks force John Brogden, New South Wales Opposition Leader for the Liberal Party of Australia, to resign. -- 199.71.174.100 04:08, 30 August 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] It was covered by: The Australian, The Courier Mail, the BBC, The Sydney Morning Herald, India Times (short article), The Age, The Herald (in the UK), The South African Star. And it wasn't just the remarks, it was also the sexual advances, so the shortened summary would be wrong and not neutral. - Ta bu shi da yu 04:13, 30 August 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] How about "Unacceptable behaviour" ? Please just shorten this item. The Front Page is very imbalanced because of this.-- 199.71.174.100 04:26, 30 August 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] John Brogden, New South Wales Opposition Leader for the Liberal Party of Australia, resigns amid public outcry over his alleged sexual harassments and racial remarks. (Please shorten this if you can.) -- 199.71.174.100 08:56, 30 August 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Sounds good. Fixing. - Ta bu shi da yu 11:08, 30 August 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Thanks for fixing, non-bigfish. -- 199.71.174.100 11:23, 30 August 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] I think the word flood should be somewhere in the blurb about Hurricane Katrina. This is all I see on TV. Don't quite know how to best fit this in, though. -- 199.71.174.100 04:22, 30 August 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] August 28 Flag of Iraq Members of the National Assembly of Iraq sign the text of the proposed constitution. A referendum will be held on 15 October, with leaders of the Sunni Islam community already calling for a "no" vote. -- PFHLai 11:37, 2005 August 29 (UTC) I added this below Katrina because the hurricane is a 'continuing story'. I also slightly modified it to say "Sunni Arab" rather than "Sunni Islam".--Pharos 13:11, 29 August 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Thanks, Pharos. Always good to have some peer review here. -- PFHLai 13:14, 2005 August 29 (UTC) BTW, the article is rather deficient. We should really go over the AP's translated text and try to have something at least as good as Law of Administration for the State of Iraq for the Transitional Period.--Pharos 13:23, 29 August 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Re: England v Australia 25-29 August 2005 Have it say this: The English cricket team win the Fourth Test at Nottingham by 3 wickets to go 2-1 up in their 5 Test series against Australia. jguk 18:59, 28 August 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Note: This is now the most significant series of cricket since 1981 and is being watched enthusiastically not only in the UK and Australia but throughout the cricketing world. Much as I am delighted at England's victory, I don't think this is front-page news. The end of the series would be, per precedent of the UEFA Cup and Champions League etc (this is probably equal in relevance in real terms), but this just doesn't quite nudge it to front-page status to me. [[smoddy]] 19:12, 28 August 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] I can't see why it shouldn't push an American politician making an apology four days ago off the page, jguk 19:24, 28 August 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] I don't think that should have gone on there either. But this is of marginal interest outside the UK and Australia, especially as it is to be repeated in just a couple of weeks' time. I hate to say it as well, but that article reads as a news report, not the kind of article we want to feature on the front page. You will excuse my brutality, but I just do not think this is a suitable main page feature. [[smoddy]] 19:33, 28 August 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Traitor! jguk 23:48, 28 August 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] There is a serious point beneath this - four day old news items should be removed and replaced with whatever the best alternative is. In this case, it does appear to be a slow news week - so why shouldn't potentially less notable stories get reported? Either the edit will be accepted or others will come in with new stories and articles to replace it. Finally, no doubt this particular article will change over time and join a welcome group of articles on various cricket seasons. I'm working on the 1971/2 South African cricket season myself at the moment, jguk 23:48, 28 August 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Re: Hurricane Katrina Have it say this: Hurricane Katrina continues to strengthen reaching Category five status with winds of at least 160 mph. It has the second lowest pressure for a named American hurricane since 1851, with only Hurricane Camille having a lower measurement. Millions of people living in and around the below sea-level Louisiana city of New Orleans are leaving as the eye is expected to collide with the region within 24 hours. It is the second most intense named American hurricane since 1851. Hellohowareyou 11:40, 28 August 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] August 26 The death toll from Hurricane Katrina needs to be updated to five, and note that five people are missing. --Kitch 18:53, 26 August 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] August 25 The German Constitutional Court rules that early elections on September 18 may go ahead. Dr Gangrene 10:32, 25 August 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] August 24 Chinese railroad workers in Tibet laid rails on the Tanggula Mountain Pass in Tibet at 5,072 m (16,640 ft) above sea level. This section of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway is now the highest railway in the world. The railway is expected to open later in 2005. (Xinhua) August 23 Flag of Peru TANS Peru Flight 204 crashed near Pucallpa, Peru with 100 on board, killing at least 41. It is the fifth major airline accident in August, 2005. (Will putting this stub on the Front Page bring the attention it deserves ?) -- 199.71.174.100 07:48, 24 August 2005 (UTC) -- revised by Mamawrites 15:25, 24 August 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] The August 23 TANS Peru Flight 204 crash in Peru should be added to the news section. --ThomasK 07:48, August 24, 2005 (UTC) Would somebody please remove the Lance Armstrong blurb? It's just the same old accusations rehashed. Until it is given further merit (such as a deeper investigation by RACE OFFICIALS), it should not be given any more credibility than it's lost over the last seven years. --Kitch 11:04, 23 August 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] I'm guessing you haven't read any of the coverage. It's not an accusation, he has actually tested positive.

Acetic Acid 22:29, August 21, 2005 (UTC) I'll have to pass on this for the time being. This is a mysterious death of an otherwise non-notable person. And, the wikipage on Herrion has too little material. May reconsider if the news story gets interesting. -- PFHLai 04:36, 2005 August 22 (UTC) Logo of World Youth Day 2005 More than 800,000 people join Pope Benedict XVI for the concluding mass of World Youth Day 2005 in Cologne, Germany. -- 199.71.174.100 09:33, 21 August 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] August 19 Former Hutu rebel leader Pierre Nkurunziza is elected as the new President of Burundi, the first president chosen through democratic m contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 78 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Wikipedia:In_the_news/Candidates/August_2005 responseCode 3 200
