Perhaps we could create a wikilink for "Ecological impact" immediately prior to the "Economic impact" link? Thanks! 98.155.8.5 (talk) 19:31, 2 June 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] New articles[edit] New articles needed for current new and old battles that have been going on for months: Kherson oblast: Battle of Liubymivka Zaporizhzhia oblast: Battle of Orikhiv Attack on Energodar Donetska oblast: Battle of Velyka Novosilka Battle of Krasnohorivka Kharkiv oblast: Battle of Barvinkove Battle of Zolochiv — Baba Mica (talk) 02:04, 21 August 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] I don't think any is notable, maybe except Barvinkove. Super Ψ Dro 09:58, 22 August 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] Agreed with Super Dromaeosaurus, all of these could easily fit in their respective campaign pages. Jebiguess (talk) 00:01, 7 September 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] Kupyansk offensive[edit] Ukrainian forces have launched an offensive in eastern Kharkiv oblast, capturing the cities of Balakliia and Shevchenkove. Despite major media attention, no articles have been created for it. Could someone create an article for the offensive and one for the Battle of Balakliia? Jebiguess (talk) 13:24, 9 September 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] how do we organize this template?[edit] my idea would be to split by phases of the invasion, the first one (invasion), the battle for donbas, and the current counteroffensive, at least its the way most RS are organizing it as far as i can see. ZoopyCat (talk) 19:48, 9 September 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply] Zhytomyr and Odesa[edit] I had a small discussion with Super Dromaeosaurus about that before, but ill kind of start it again. in general, i think that the Odesa and Zhytomyr bombings should be moved to the Southern and the Kyiv campaigns/offensives respectively. reason: the bombings in both were directly linked to either disrupting Ukrainian forces in the region to prevent them moving to the main battle area (possibly what happened in Zhytomyr to prevent Ukrainian troops reaching Kyiv region to support the forces already there), or conquering the city/region (Odesa case, in which conquering the city was one of the primary goals of the initial southern offensive), they are also kind of linked to the campaigns/offensives, as they not only are on the same region, but had parts of the Oblast they are in occupied by Russian forces (several villages and railways in Zhytomyr Oblast and Snake island in Odesa Oblast). any thoughts on this? SnoopyBird (talk) 17:13, 3 January 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Separate into different campaignboxes[edit] As the war has gone on for almost a year now, and the campaignbox is filling up with incidents and battles related to the war, I propose we separate the main campaignbox into five separate campaignboxes a la the Syrian civil war or the War in Afghanistan. The five boxes would be Kyiv Offensive Northeastern Ukraine campaign Eastern Ukraine campaign with bolded parts delineating the Battle of Donbas and Kharkiv counteroffensive Southern Ukraine campaign with bolded parts delineating the Kherson counteroffensive Other regions, comprising all other regions bolded like they are now (this may not be the best idea, if you have another that would fit better comment it) I think overall this would declutter many current pages about the war and further ones to be created. Jebiguess (talk) 23:25, 8 February 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] As an alternative, I would support creating campaignboxes and using them selectively in some articles instead of this template, and then removing less notable entries from the main campaignbox. Maybe also make a separate campaignbox for notable missile strikes etc.? We don't need them cluttering the main campaignbox IMHO. RadioactiveBoulevardier (talk) 23:17, 13 March 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Oppose because the template is not that cluttered. Some organization can help make it look more tidy. Super Ψ Dro 10:06, 26 March 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] We could also nest campaignboxes inside the main one, similar to what is done with the main invasion outline template. RadioactiveBoulevardier (talk) 21:52, 2 May 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] BRD of bloat purge[edit] @Super Dromaeosaurus Sorry for not noticing your revert for over a month. Look, this is a campaignbox, not the main overview template. It's too big. A lot of things could be cut. Next time, can you at least go through it item by item manually like I did before pressing the rv button? RadioactiveBoulevardier (talk) 21:47, 2 May 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] I had to check the history of this template back to March to even know what is this about. I asked you to get consensus before removing articles from the campaignbox, as including all related articles to this template is how we've been doing things since the very start of the war. Also, I disagree that it is too long. We have stuff like this [1] in Wikipedia. All it needs is better organization. Which might be quite pointless to do while the war continues.
