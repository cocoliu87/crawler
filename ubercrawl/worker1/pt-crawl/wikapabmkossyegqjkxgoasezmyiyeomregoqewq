Examples include "So Long Dearie" from Hello, Dolly!, "If He Walked Into My Life" from Mame, "Rose's Turn" from Gypsy, "Work the Wound" from Passing Strange, and "Cabaret" from Cabaret.[1] It was so named because in the days when musical performances would start at 8:30 p.m., this song would occur around 11:00 p.m.[2] Among the theatre community, there is some debate as to the characteristics of an 11 o'clock number. It often signifies a moment of revelation or change in heart of a lead character, although there are exceptions to this.[3] The 11 o'clock number is also differentiated from the finale in that it is not the final number in the show, but even this is not considered a requirement by some commenters.[4] Broadway producer Jack Viertel defines an 11 o'clock number as "a final star turn".[5] Other notable 11 o'clock numbers include "Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat" from Guys and Dolls,[3] "Memory" from Cats,[6] "Brotherhood of Man" from How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,[7] “No Good Deed” from Wicked, "Gimme Gimme" from Thoroughly Modern Millie,[4] "Another National Anthem" from Assassins,[8] "The American Dream" from Miss Saigon, "Goodbye" from Catch Me If You Can, "Revolting Children" from Matilda The Musical, "I'm Here" from The Color Purple,[9] and "Always Starting Over" from If/Then.[10] References[edit] ^ Scott Miller, "May I Have a Definition?", The Bad Boy of Musical Theatre blog, 2014 ^ Ben Rimalower (19 July 2014).
