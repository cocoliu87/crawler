Breaking/Bboying A breakdancer performing outside Faneuil Hall, Boston, United States Genre Hip-hop dance Inventor Street dancers Year Early 1970s Origin New York City Breaking in the street, 2013 A breakdancer standing on his head in Cologne, Germany, 2017 Breaking, also called b-boying, b-girling or breakdancing, is an athletic style of street dance originating from the African American and later Puerto Rican communities in New York City, United States. While diverse in the amount of variation available in the dance, breakdancing mainly consists of four kinds of movement: toprock, downrock, power moves and freezes. Breakdancing is typically set to songs containing drum breaks, especially in funk, soul music and hip-hop music, although modern trends allow for much wider varieties of music along certain ranges of tempo and beat patterns. The modern dance elements of breakdancing originated among the poor youth of New York during the early 1970s, where it was introduced as breaking.[1] It is closely attributed to the birth of hip-hop, as DJs developed rhythmic breaks for dancers.[2] The dance form has since expanded globally, with an array of organizations and independent competitions supporting its growth. Breaking will now be featured as an Olympic sport, making its debut in the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics.[3] Following the proposal by the World DanceSport Federation (WDSF) the IOC decided to include Breaking on 7 December 2020.[4] A practitioner of this dance is called a b-boy, b-girl, breakdancer or breaker. Although the term "breakdance" is frequently used to refer to the dance in popular culture and in the mainstream entertainment industry, "b-boying" and "breaking" were the original terms and are preferred by the majority of the pioneers and most notable practitioners.[5][6] Terminology[edit] A common claim is that the term "Breakdance" was a creation of the media or of Rock Steady Crew manager Ruza "Kool Lady" Blue, this may be incorrect as it was used by Hiphop pioneer Kurtis Blow in a 1980 profile by Bill Adler in the New York Daily News, prior to any other media coverage, and prior to Blue's 1981 arrival in New York.[7][verification needed] Some enthusiasts consider "breakdancing" an ignorant, and even pejorative, term, due to the media's exploitation of the art form,[8] while others use it to derogatorily refer to studio-trained dancers that can perform the moves but who do not live a "b-boy lifestyle",[9]: 61  and accuse the media of displaying a simplified[10] version of the dance that focused on "tricks" instead of culture.[11] The term "breakdancing" has become an umbrella term that includes California-based dance styles such as popping, locking, and electric boogaloo, in addition to the New York-based b-boying.[9]: 60 [12][13][14] The dance itself is called "breaking."[15] The terms "b-boy" ("break-boy"), "b-girl" ("break-girl"), and "breaker" were the original terms used to describe the dancers who performed to DJ Kool Herc's breakbeats. The obvious connection of the term "breaking" is to the word "breakbeat".[citation needed] DJ Kool Herc has commented that the term "breaking" was 1970s slang for "getting excited", "acting energetically" or "causing a disturbance".[16] Most breakdancing pioneers and practitioners prefer the terms "b-boy", "b-girl", and/or "breaker" when referring to these dancers. For those immersed in hip-hop culture, the term "breakdancer" may be used to disparage those who learn the dance for personal gain rather than for commitment to the culture.[9]: 61  B-boy London of the New York City Breakers and filmmaker Michael Holman refer to these dancers as "breakers".[5] Frosty Freeze of the Rock Steady Crew says, "we were known as b-boys", and hip-hop pioneer Afrika Bambaataa says, "b-boys, [are] what you call break boys... or b-girls, what you call break girls."[5] In addition, co-founder of Rock Steady Crew Santiago "Jo Jo" Torres, Rock Steady Crew member Marc "Mr. Freeze" Lemberger, hip-hop historian Fab 5 Freddy, and rappers Big Daddy Kane[17] and Tech N9ne[18] use the term "b-boy".[5] Source Quote Citation Kurtis Blow But it was in his secret identity as a B-boy (B for Beat) during after-school hours that Kurtis really shined. "I was the best dancer at the school " he claimed. "When I was 15 I used to go down to Nell Gwinn's[sic] and do that frantic Breakdance- the fancy, fancy footwork to the funky, funky music- and I would have the crowd in the palm of my hand." [7] Richard "Crazy Legs" Colon; Rock Steady Crew "When I first learned about the dance in 1977 it was called b-boying... by the time the media got a hold of it in like '81, '82, it became 'break-dancing' and I even got caught up calling it break-dancing too." [5] Michael Holman, New York City Breakers "Maybe what Legs is doing is saying "I want to reeducate the marketplace and make them see that everything that came before was 'breakdancing' and what's going on now is 'b-boying.' And it's all under my control and auspices and whim and whatever." And so it's a cleansing; it's like an etymological purging....But it's smart, because it's a paradigm shift in which he now is not just a player but is a kingmaker. A kingpin." [9]: 62  Mandalit del Barco, journalist "Breakdancing may have died, but the b-boy, one of four original elements of hip hop (also included: the MC, the DJ, and the graffiti artist) lives on. To those who knew it before it was tagged with the name breakdancing, to those still involved in the scene that they will always know as b-boying, the tradition is alive and, well, spinning." [19] Foundation, by Joseph Schloss "In addition to its general association with commercialism, the term breakdancing is also problematic on a more practical level. Unlike b-boying, which refers to a specific dance form that developed in New York City in the '70s, breakdancing is often used as an umbrella term that includes not only b-boying, but also popping, locking, boogalooing, and other so-called funk-style dances that originated in California." [9]: 60  The Electric Boogaloos "In the 80's when streetdancing [sic] blew up, the media often incorrectly used the term 'breakdancing' as an umbrella term for most the streetdancing [sic] styles that they saw. What many people didn't know was [that] within these styles, other sub-cultures existed, each with their own identities. Breakdancing, or b-boying as it is more appropriately known as, is known to have its roots in the east coast and was heavily influenced by break beats and hip hop." [20] Timothy "Popin' Pete" Solomon; Electric Boogaloos "An important thing to clarify is that the term 'Break dancing' is wrong, I read that in many magazines but that is a media term. The correct term is 'Breakin', people who do it are B-Boys and B-Girls. The term 'Break dancing' has to be thrown out of the dance vocabulary." [21] Hip-Hop Dance Conservatory "Breaking or b-boying is generally misconstrued or incorrectly termed as 'breakdancing'. Breakdancing is a term spawned from the loins of the media's philistinism, sciolism, and naïveté at that time. With no true knowledge of the hip-hop diaspora but with an ineradicable need to define it for the nescient masses, the term breakdancing was born. Most breakers take great offense to the term." [22] Jeff Chang "During the 1970s, an array of dances practiced by black and Latino kids sprang up in the inner cities of New York and California. The styles had a dizzying list of names: 'uprock' in Brooklyn, 'locking' in Los Angeles, 'boogaloo' and 'popping' in Fresno, and 'strutting' in San Francisco and Oakland. When these dances gained notice in the mid-'80s outside of their geographic contexts, the diverse styles were lumped together under the tag 'break dancing'. [14] American Heritage Dictionary "b-boy (bē′boi′) n. A man or boy who engages in b-boying. [b-, probably short for BREAK (from the danceable breaks in funk recordings from which turntablists make breakbeat music to which b-boying is done ) + BOY.]" "break dancing also break·danc·ing (brāk dăn′sĭng) n. A form of nonrhythmic urban dance characterized by acrobatic and gymnastic movements." "break·ing (brā kĭng) n. A form of urban dance involving styles such as locking, popping, and b-boying, usually performed to funk music. Also called break dancing."

A breaker practicing downrock at a studio in Moscow Many elements of breaking can be seen in other antecedent cultures prior to the 1970s. B-boy pioneers Richard "Crazy Legs" Colon and Kenneth "Ken Swift" Gabbert, both of Rock Steady Crew, cite James Brown and Kung Fu films (notably Bruce Lee films) as influences.[26][27][28] Many of the acrobatic moves, such as the flare, show clear connections to gymnastics. In the 1877 book Rob Roy on the Baltic,[29] John MacGregor describes seeing near Norrköping a '...young man quite alone, who was practicing over and over the most inexplicable leap in the air...he swung himself up, and then round on his hand for a point, when his upper leg described a great circle...'. The engraving shows a young man apparently breakdancing. The dance was called the Giesse Harad Polska or 'salmon district dance'. In 1894 Thomas Edison filmed Walter Wilkins, Denny Toliver and Joe Rastus dancing and performing a "breakdown".[30][31] Then in 1898 he filmed a young street dancer performing acrobatic headspins.[32] Some authors claim that breakdancing and capoeira have common African origin, while others claim that capoeira directly influenced breaking.[33] There is also evidence of the similar style of dancing in Kaduna, Nigeria in 1959.[34] However, it was not until the 1970s th contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 46 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Breakdancing responseCode 3 200
