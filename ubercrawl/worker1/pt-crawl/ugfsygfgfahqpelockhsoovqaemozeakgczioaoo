It is a Full Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) with Test, One-Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) status. It played its first Test match in November 2000 against India with a 9 wicket loss in Dhaka, becoming the tenth Test-playing nation.[12][13][14][15][16] It became an associate member of the ICC in 1977,[17] and competed in six ICC Trophies. Bangladesh's first official foray into international cricket came in the 1979 ICC Trophy in England. On 31 March 1986, Bangladesh played its first ODI match, against Pakistan in the Asia Cup. For a long time, football was the most popular sport in Bangladesh, but cricket gradually became very popular – particularly in urban areas – and by the late 1990s had surpassed football. Bangladesh made its full debut in international cricket in the 1986 Asia Cup. In 1997, Bangladesh won the ICC Trophy in Malaysia and thus qualified for its first Cricket World Cup to participate in England in 1999. There, it defeated Pakistan – causing much upset – and also Scotland. On 26 June 2000, Bangladesh was granted full ICC membership.[18][19][20][21][22] Bangladesh holds the record for most consecutive losses in Tests (21, between 2000 and 2002) and ODIs (23, between 2001 and 2004). After becoming Full Member , they had to wait until 2004 for its first ODI win since the 1999 World Cup which was against Zimbabwe. Bangladesh's maiden Test victory was against Zimbabwe in 2005 where securing a draw in the 2nd match, Bangladesh won their first Test series. In 2009 Bangladesh toured the West Indies for two Tests and by winning both secured their first overseas Test series victory. As of 17 June 2023, Bangladesh has played 138 Tests, winning 18. Its first victory was against Zimbabwe, and the next two came against the West Indies. Results have improved predominantly at home with draws earned against Pakistan, India and South Africa and wins against England, Sri Lanka, New Zealand and Australia.[23] They played their 100th Test when they toured Sri Lanka in March 2017 which they won by 4 wickets.[24][25][26][27][28][29] As of 31 October 2023, the team has won 156 of its 432 ODI matches.[30] They played their 100th ODI[31][32] when India toured Bangladesh in December 2004 which they won, 200th ODI when Bangladesh toured West Indies in 2009 which they won, 300th ODI[33] in the quarter-final of the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup against India, which India won and 400th ODI against Zimbabwe which they won.[34][35] They got their 100th ODI win when Afghanistan toured Bangladesh in October 2016.[36][37] Bangladesh have also played 155 T20Is, winning 58.[38] They played their 100th T20I against Zimbabwe in July 2021 which they won.[39][40] Results have improved with wins against Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand and West Indies.[41] Bangladesh's major achievements include reaching the semi-finals in 2017 ICC Champions Trophy, the quarter-finals in 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup, being runners up in three Asia Cups (in 2012, 2016 and 2018) and in 2018 Nidahas Trophy and winning 2019 Ireland Tri-Nation Series which was Bangladesh's first ever multi-team ODI tournament final win. As of 28 September 2023, Bangladesh is ranked 9th in Tests, 7th in ODIs and 9th in T20Is by the ICC.[42] History[edit] Main article: History of cricket in Bangladesh 20th century[edit] Several East Pakistan-based sides played in Pakistani domestic cricket prior to Bangladesh's declaration of independence of 1971—the East Pakistan cricket team fielded three players who later played ICC Trophy matches. In 1977, Bangladesh became an Associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC).[43] Bangladesh was one of fifteen teams to take part in the inaugural ICC Trophy. Held in 1979, it gave non-Test playing countries the opportunity to qualify for that year's World Cup. Bangladesh, under the captaincy of Raqibul Hasan, won two matches and lost two, but failed to progress beyond the first round.[44][45] Victory in the South-East Asian Cricket Conference Tournament in February 1984 ensured Bangladesh qualified for the 1986 Asia Cup.[46] On 31 March 1986, Bangladesh played their first One Day International against a Full Member of the ICC.[47] 31 March 1986 Scorecard Bangladesh 94 all out (35.3 overs) v Pakistan 98/3 (32.1 overs) Shaheedur Rahman 37 (60) Wasim Akram 4/19 (9 overs) Mudassar Nazar 47 (97) Jahangir Shah 2/23 (9 overs) Pakistan won by 7 wickets Tyronne Fernando Stadium, Moratuwa, Sri Lanka Umpires: Herbi Felsinger (SL) and PW Vidanagamage (SL) Player of the match: Wasim Akram Captained by Gazi Ashraf, Bangladesh were dismissed for 94 and Pakistan reached their target for victory with seven wickets in hand.[48] They lost their second ODI, which was against Sri Lanka, finishing last in the three-team tournament.[49] Bangladesh qualified for the 1988 Asia Cup, this time hosting the tournament; it was the first time ODIs had been staged in the country. Although they lost all their matches, Bangladesh's fixtures were retrospectively awarded ODI. Floods in the preceding months meant the tournament was in doubt, but it went ahead as planned. A charity match raised $70,000 for the flood victims.[50] Bangladesh added a black mark in 1986 ICC Trophy with only 2 wins.[51] Bangladesh took part in the 1990 Austral-Asia Cup,[52] the Asia Cup in 1990–91, 1995,[53] 1997,[54] and several other triangular tournaments, but it was not until 1998 that they won their first ODI. Their 22-match losing streak since their first ODI was at the time a record.[55] 16 May 1998 Scorecard Kenya 236 all out (49 overs) v Bangladesh 237/4 (48 overs) Ravi Shah 52 (64) Mohammad Rafique 3/56 (10 overs) Mohammad Rafique 77 (87) Mohammad Sheikh 2/46 (10 overs) Bangladesh won by 6 wickets Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium, Hyderabad, India Umpires: SK Sharma (Ind) and C. R. Mohite[56] (Ind) Player of the match: Mohammad Rafique Bangladesh posted its first ODI win against Kenya, in India thanks largely to Mohammad Rafique, who contributed a fiery 77 runs and took 3 wickets. Put on 137 for the first wicket with Athar Ali Khan whose own contribution was 47.[57] In October 1998, Bangladesh hosted (but did not participate in) the first ICC KnockOut Trophy ever held (the event later became the ICC Champions Trophy), a knock-out ODI tournament featuring all the Test playing nations. Bangladesh took part in each of the 1979, 1982, 1986, 1990, and 1994 editions of the ICC Trophy, and won the trophy in 1997, in the process qualified for the 1999 World Cup. The then General Secretary of Bangladesh Cricket Board, Aminul Huq Moni took the initiative to install Astro Turf in Abahani Cricket Ground and Bangabandhu National Stadium, so that the local players had two full seasons to prepare on the type of pitch they would playing in ICC Trophy in 1997.[58] Bangladesh also became a regular ICC member with the right to play ODIs and started hosting bilateral and triangular ODI tournaments. Earlier, in February Dhaka hosted the third and final SAARC cricket tournament. Bangladesh played in its first World Cup in England in 1999 and recorded their first win in a World Cup match against Scotland. Later Bangladesh created an enormous upset by beating Pakistan by 62 runs in the group match at Northampton. Bangladesh made 9/223 from its full 50 overs, and in reply, Pakistan could only manage 161 due to timely run-outs by wicket-keeper Khaled Mashud and some tight bowling by Khaled Mahmud, who took 3/31 from 10 overs. Mahmud was judged the man of the match. Bangladesh did not qualify for the Super Six round due to defeats in three of its five matches. However, the win over Pakistan, who finished runners-up to Au contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 66 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Bangladesh_national_cricket_team responseCode 3 200
