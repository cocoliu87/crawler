Thanks. Archived discussion for September 2007 from Wikipedia:In the news section on the Main Page/Candidates. September 30 A crop from this image could be used to illustrate this ITN item. At least 4 are killed by the unexpected eruption of the dormant volcano on the Yemeni Red Sea island of Jabal al-Tair. -- !! ?? 15:15, 1 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Added. This is a perfect ITN article - boringly encyclopedic, with info on the recent event proportional to its importance to the topic as a whole - IMO of course. And I'm not just saying this because ITN is on the point of becoming a sports ticker. Heh. - BanyanTree 23:08, 1 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] How would people feel about replacing the image of Gebrselassie with a crop from Image:Eruption of Jabal al-Tair Island at night.jpg? Gebrselassie hasn't been up for very long, but it's pretty cool that we've got a free image of an active volcano. I can do the honors if people think it's a good idea. (Image:071001a-006.jpg is also available, but I like the night image personally.) —Josiah Rowe (talk • contribs) 02:18, 2 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] When the Gebrselassie pic gets old, yes, sure. But I don't think we are there yet. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe then, there'll be a even cooler pic of the volcano available. :-) --PFHLai 03:04, 2 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] While I've been eying the awesomeness of that volcano at night photo myself, I'm not sure it looks like anything but a red blur at ITN thumbnail sizes. See right. - BanyanTree 14:37, 2 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Italian Paulo Bettini wins the World Road Race Championships for a second consecutive time in Stuttgart, Germany. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 86.138.47.230 (talk • contribs) I only endorse putting up Paolo Bettini's victory at the 2007 UCI Road World Championships - Men's Road Race if one of the other sports items is taken down. Otherwise, only the NASA spacecraft or the Burmese protests would not be about sports. That would be too much. AecisBrievenbus 13:20, 1 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Is the UCI Road World Championships internationally well-known? I didn't even know what race this is - I just found out it was a cycling race with teeny-weeny blurb at the BBC Sport website. --Howard the Duck 15:14, 1 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] It is about as well known as the official World Championship in one of the most well watched sports in the world can be. All of the major cyclists took part, except for those who weren't allowed to take part because of doping issues. I'm not sure it's as notable as the Tour de France, but it certainly is notable. AecisBrievenbus 17:27, 1 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Surely it is more popular than the other "sports" on the news section; chess and women's football?! — Preceding unsigned comment added by 86.138.47.230 (talk • contribs) Admittedly, I'm not a big follower of sports, but I'd personally say that cycling is about even with the sports currently on ITN in terms of popularity. Chess, cycling, women's football and track and field all have small but devoted followings. I'm not sure what criteria one could use to determine which of the four is more or less popular. By the way, I agree with Aecis that the cycling result can go up only if it replaces one of the other sports items. —Josiah Rowe (talk • contribs) 02:25, 2 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I'm pretty sure that the popularity of the UCI World Championship is nowhere in comparison with the Tour de France. --Howard the Duck 02:31, 2 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Not to mention this blurb is nowhere to be found at Portal:Current events/Sports. --Howard the Duck 02:34, 2 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie becomes the world record holder for the marathon, winning the 2007 Berlin Marathon with a time of 2:04:26. --SteveRwanda 14:26, 30 September 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I second this nomination. It's been 4 years since the world record was last broken. --Synesthetic 06:06, 1 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Indian chess player Viswanathan Anand wins the 2007 World Championship at Mexico City to become the new world champion. --Victor12 15:26, 30 September 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Please guys, let's make some choices here. All of these proposals meet our criteria, since these are all notable events in notable sports with, it appears, all the necessary updates to the relevant articles. But if we post all of these, we'll have the Women's Football World Cup, the Chess World Championship, the AFL title and the marathon world record, four sports items, on ITN. I think that's way too much. I suggest we choose one item, for the sake of the balance in ITN content. AecisBrievenbus 16:18, 30 September 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Fair enough. It seems to me that going by ITN criteria (specially It should be a story of an international importance, or at least interest) the least important of these four stories is the AFL title as it is an Australian championship whereas the other three stories refer to international events. There are currently two sport stories (football and cricket) on ITN. If we upload two more (chess and marathon), the item on cricket would go away, being at the end of the list. That'll leave us with 3 sport news out of 6 ITN items. Is that OK? --Victor12 16:54, 30 September 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I personally think that 3 out of 6 items is still a bit much, especially if you keep in mind the fact that these will be the first three items on ITN. The first non-sports item would be the Vukovar massacre verdict, at position 4. AecisBrievenbus 17:17, 30 September 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] So it comes down to chess vs marathon as football is already up there. Although one could argue that chess is not a sport but a game, but let's not go there. ;-) What kind of criteria should we use to decide among them? The popularity of the sport? The importance of the event for that particular sport? Any other criteria? --Victor12 17:22, 30 September 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I'd rather see fresh content on ITN than see content I'm personally interested in. For three out of six stories to be sport is better than having old stories. Talking of old stories, why was Dawn (spacecraft) not posted from 28 September?-gadfium 19:10, 30 September 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I would have put the Dawn item up if I had seen it in time (now is probably too late). Thue | talk 19:15, 30 September 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I don't see the problem with putting many sports-related items up, as long as they qualify. Sometimes things just happen at the same time. Thue | talk 19:15, 30 September 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Ok, since the two items seem about equal I randomly posted one, the chess championships. I thought about posting the other one too, but that would have pushed Burma off the news, which would be bad as Burma is very much still newsworthy. I think we should update the burma headline, put Burma at the top, and then add the Marathon headline. Thue | talk 20:30, 30 September 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Could you just shorten the headline used for the other two sports-related items, and thus make room for the third, without losing an item? Espresso Addict 08:43, 1 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Not a bad idea, I don't see how they could easily be significantly shortened. Thue | talk 09:02, 1 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I'm not immensely familiar with the style used at ITN, so forgive me if I violate the syntax (I hang out at DYK), but: "Indian Viswanathan Anand wins the 2007 World Championship to become the new world chess champion." or "Indian Viswanathan Anand wins the 2007 World Chess Championship to become the new world champion." or even "Indian Viswanathan Anand becomes the 2007 world chess champion." "Germany defeats Brazil at the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup to win its second world title." or even "Germany defeats Brazil at the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup." ...would probably free up enough space for "Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie beats the marathon world record with a time of 2:04:26." Espresso Addict 09:20, 1 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I added the marathon item by shortening the items. I read your suggestions, but I was tweaking the formulations so I don't know how much of the formulation is mine and how much is yours :). Thue | talk 10:17, 1 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Hmm, the main page isn't that balanced right now :(. Thue | talk 10:17, 1 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Cheers! There was a gap at the bottom of DYK before the change to ITN -- we're not used to such a short FA blurb. Espresso Addict 10:23, 1 October 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] September 29 Geelong become the 2007 AFL premiers after beating Port Adelaide 24.19.163 to 6.8.44 in the 2007 AFL Grand Final - a record-breaking margin of 119 points. And before you start arguing against it, consider this: A news item about the Super Bowl (American Football's equivalant to a grand final) was added even before the game had ended [1] ("being played") - the result with scores was posted soon after and remained there It is the highest level of Australian Football in the world It is broadcast around the world almost as much as American Football is The game itself has a whole article about it The game had a 119 point margin - the highest ever in a grand final (most within recent years are quite close) For the non-AFL people, the score in English was 163-44. --Howard the Duck 15:37, 29 September 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Support, as long as it can be rewritten for clarity's sake. Sasha Callahan 15:39, 29 September 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] The article has absolutely zero references, and isn't covered by the BBC or [CNN. --Howard the Duck 15:43, 29 September 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Since when has coverage by either BBC or CNN been a requirement?
