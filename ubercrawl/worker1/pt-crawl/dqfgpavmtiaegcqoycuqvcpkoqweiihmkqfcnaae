It was contested by the runners-up from the previous tournament, New Zealand, and the host nation, England. It was the fifth time Lord's had hosted the Cricket World Cup Final, the most of any ground.[1] The two teams were tied on 241 runs at the end of the match, resulting in a Super Over being played to break the tie. On the final ball of New Zealand's Super Over, after equalling the 15 runs England managed in their over, Martin Guptill attempted to score the winning run but was run out by Jason Roy and Jos Buttler, meaning the Super Over was also tied. England won on the boundary count-back rule, having scored 26 boundaries to New Zealand's 17, thus becoming Cricket World Cup winners for the first time. It was the first time a One Day International final match required a Super Over, and subsequently the first time it had been decided by a boundary count. The match has been described as one of the greatest and most dramatic in the history of the sport, with some analysts describing it as the greatest match in the history of one-day cricket.[2][3][4][5] Background[edit] Main article: 2019 Cricket World Cup The 2019 Cricket World Cup started on 30 May and was hosted by England and Wales. Ten teams played each other once in a round-robin format with the top four teams going through to the semi-finals. Fourth-placed New Zealand beat group winners India in the first semi-final,[6] and England, who finished third in the group, defeated second-placed Australia in the second.[7] England played in their first final in 27 years,[8] their last appearance coming in 1992, when they were defeated by Pakistan at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Their other appearances in the final were in 1979 against the West Indies at Lord's and 1987 against Australia at Eden Gardens. Despite playing in the second-highest number of finals in the World Cup after Australia, they were yet to win the trophy.[8] New Zealand played in their second final, and also their second in a row. They previously played in the 2015 final but were beaten by Australia.[8] When England reached the final, demand increased greatly for it to be shown on a free-to-air television channel in the United Kingdom. Rights holders Sky Sports agreed to allow Channel 4, who had the rights to broadcast evening highlights of the tournament, to carry the final in a simulcast (England cricket matches are not compulsory events requiring free-to-air broadcast). However, due to an existing commitment by Channel 4 to cover the 2019 British Grand Prix, the coverage switched to their sister channel More4 during the motor racing, returning to Channel 4 after the Grand Prix had finished. It was the first time an England international match had been broadcast on free-to-air television in the UK since the 2005 Ashes series.[9] Whichever team won the match would become the first new winner of the World Cup since Sri Lanka's victory in 1996. It was also the first world final with a guaranteed new winner since 1992.[10] Road to the final[edit] Main article: 2019 Cricket World Cup group stage Route to the final[edit] England Round New Zealand Opponent Result Group stage Opponent Result South Africa England won by 104 runs Match 1 Sri Lanka New Zealand won by 10 wickets Pakistan Pakistan won by 14 runs Match 2 Bangladesh New Zealand won by 2 wickets Bangladesh England won by 106 runs Match 3 Afghanistan New Zealand won by 7 wickets West Indies England won by 8 wickets Match 4 India Match abandoned Afghanistan England won by 150 runs Match 5 South Africa New Zealand won by 4 wickets Sri Lanka Sri Lanka won by 20 runs Match 6 West Indies New Zealand won by 5 runs Australia Australia won by 64 runs Match 7 Pakistan Pakistan won by 6 wickets India England won by 31 runs Match 8 Australia Australia won by 86 runs New Zealand England won by 119 runs Match 9 England England won by 119 runs Group stage 3rd Place Pos Team P W L T NR Pts NRR Qualification 3 England 9 6 3 0 0 12 1.152 Advance to semi-finals Final group standings Group stage 4th Place Pos Team P W L T NR Pts NRR Qualification 4 New Zealand 9 5 3 0 1 11 0.175 Advance to semi-finals Opponent Result Knockout stage Opponent Result Australia England won by 8 wickets Semi-finals India New Zealand won by 18 runs New Zealand[edit] New Zealand retained the majority of the team that reached their maiden World Cup Final as co-hosts in 2015, although Kane Williamson took on the captaincy following Brendon McCullum's retirement. They finished level on 11 points with Pakistan in the round-robin stage (five wins, three losses and one no result after their match against India was interrupted by rain), but took fourth place by virtue of a better net run rate than Pakistan. In the semi-finals, they were paired with India, who finished first in the round-robin stage. The match was played at Old Trafford in Manchester on 9 July. With New Zealand on 211/5 after 46.1 overs, Williamson having scored 67 and Ross Taylor on the same score at the time, the match was suspended by rain and ultimately play was pushed to the reserve day the next day. Eventually finishing on 239/8, Taylor eventually out for 74, they produced a spirited bowling and fielding performance to leave India 18 runs short. Man of the Match Matt Henry took 3/37, including openers Rohit Sharma and K. L. Rahul caught for just one each and Dinesh Karthik spectacularly caught by James Neesham for 6. Meanwhile, fellow pace bowler Trent Boult had captain Virat Kohli trapped lbw for one and top scorer Ravindra Jadeja caught by Williamson for 77 when a seventh-wicket partnership looked to be swinging the match back in India's favour. Finally, Martin Guptill ran out World Cup-winning captain MS Dhoni for 50 with a direct hit to leave India with just their tail.[11] England[edit] England, by contrast, entered as the top-ranked ODI team after director of cricket and former Ashes-winning captain Andrew Strauss helped orchestrate the national team's white-ball revamp following their bowing out in the group stage in 2015. Only a handful of the players who featured in 2019, including Irish-born captain Eoin Morgan, Test captain Joe Root, wicket-keeper Jos Buttler and bowling all-rounder Chris Woakes, were holdovers from that team, though a good number played in the narrow defeat against the West Indies in the 2016 World Twenty20 Final. Morgan was also the lone remaining member of England's 2010 World Twenty20 champion team – England's only ICC world championship going into this final. Their campaign was nearly derailed after a loss at Lord's to defending champions and arch-rivals Australia left them having to beat both India and New Zealand to guarantee their semi-final spot. They won both games and finished third in the round-robin stage with 12 points (six wins and three losses out of nine matches). They met group runners-up Australia in the second semi-final at Edgbaston on 11 July and soundly defeated them by 8 wickets to progress to the final. Key moments included Woakes having David Warner caught for 9, Jofra Archer trapping captain Aaron Finch lbw for a golden duck, Buttler running out Australian top scorer and former captain Steve Smith through his legs on 85 and Jason Roy's 85 off 65 as England completed their chase with 107 balls to spare.[12] Match[edit] Match officials[edit] Lord's hosted its fifth Cricket World Cup Final. On 12 July 2019, the International Cricket Council (ICC) named Sri Lankan Kumar Dharmasena and South African Marais Erasmus as the on-field umpires, with Australian Rod Tucker as the third umpire, Pakistani Aleem Dar as the reserve umpire and Sri Lankan Ranjan Madugalle named as match referee.[13] Teams and toss[edit] Both teams remained unchanged from their semi-final matches; New Zealand decided that the line-up that beat India against the odds would work in their favour in the final, while England's Jason Roy avoided suspension after his show of dissent in their semi-final match against Australia to open the batting for the hosts.[14] Some early rain slightly delayed the toss, with the match starting at 10:45, 15 minutes later than scheduled. It was feared that the rain would interfere with the match, but it cleared up quickly, although the overcast conditions and wet grass changed the dynamic of the toss. New Zealand won the toss and decided to bat first.[15][14] New Zealand innings[edit] Martin Guptill and Henry Nicholls opened the innings for New Zealand, with Nicholls scoring his first half-century of the tournament.[16] A further 30 runs from captain Kane Williamson, and 47 from wicket-keeper Tom Latham, helped New Zealand to a total of 241/8 from their 50 overs. Chris Woakes and Liam Plunkett took three wickets each for the hosts.[17] England innings[edit] Ben Stokes was named Man of the Match. England scored 14 runs in the final over to tie the match. Defending a middling score, the New Zealand bowlers bowled effectively, hampering England's top order, with only Jonny Bairstow managing more than a start with 36. With the loss of their top order, England fell to 86/4 in the 24th over; however, a century partnership between Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler for the fifth wicket got them back into the game before Buttler was caught. But with five overs to play, England still required another 46 runs and the bottom order were forced to bat more aggressively. Stokes managed to farm the strike and, more c contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 62 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/2019_Cricket_World_Cup_final responseCode 3 200
