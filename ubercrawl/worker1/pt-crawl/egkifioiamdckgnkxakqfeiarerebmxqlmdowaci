It aggregates information from other published dictionaries, encyclopedias and reference works including pictures and videos. History[edit] The website was launched by Infonautics in March 1998.[2] Infonautics was acquired by Tucows in August 2001.[3] In August 2002, Patrick Spain bought Encyclopedia.com and its sister website eLibrary from Tucows and incorporated them in a new company called Alacritude, LLC (a combination of Alacrity and Attitude).[4] The business became known as HighBeam Research and was eventually sold to Gale.[5][6] For a time the website was operated by Chicago-based company Highbeam Research, a subsidiary of reference publisher Gale, which itself is a subsidiary of Cengage.[7][5] Content[edit] Encyclopedia.com allows users to access information on a subject from multiple encyclopedias and dictionary sources,[8] and has nearly 200,000 entries and 50,000 topic summaries. It provides a collection of online encyclopedias and entries from various sources, including Oxford University Press, Columbia Encyclopedia and Gale, its parent company.[9][10] References[edit] ^ "Curlie – Reference: Encyclopedias". curlie.org.
