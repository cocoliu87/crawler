The series was played at five venues across Australia between 23 November 2017 and 8 January 2018. England were the defending holders of the Ashes going into the series, having won in 2015. Australia won the series 4–0, regaining the Ashes after taking an unassailable lead with an innings victory in the third Test.

Tim Paine returned to the team after a seven-year absence, ahead of Matthew Wade and Peter Nevill.[4] Before the first Test, Glenn Maxwell was added to Australia's squad as cover for David Warner, who injured his neck at training.[13] Mitchell Marsh was later added to Australia's squad ahead of the third Test, replacing Chadd Sayers.[14] Australia's Mitchell Starc and England's Craig Overton were both ruled out of the fourth Test, with heel and rib injuries respectively.[15][16] Maxwell was replaced by Ashton Agar for the fifth Test.[17] England's Chris Woakes was ruled out of the fifth Test due to injury.[18] Venues[edit] 3rd Test Perth 2nd Test Adelaide 4th Test Melbourne 5th Test Sydney 1st Test Brisbane The five venues were the Gabba, Adelaide Oval, the WACA Ground, the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the Sydney Cricket Ground. The WACA Ground was expected to host its final Test during the series, prior to the opening of the new Optus Stadium. However, it was said in November 2015 that construction of the new stadium was well ahead of schedule and the Perth Test could be hosted at the new venue.[19] A decision on the venue was made in May 2017,[20] with the WACA Ground confirmed as the venue, as the new stadium would not be ready in time.[21] In December 2016, Cricket Australia (CA) were looking at hosting the first day/night Ashes match, with Adelaide being the likely venue.[22] On 12 December 2016, it was confirmed that Adelaide Oval would host the first day/night Ashes Test.[23] Matches[edit] First Test[edit] 23–27 November 2017 Scorecard England v Australia 302 (116.4 overs) James Vince 83 (170) Mitchell Starc 3/77 (28 overs) 328 (130.3 overs) Steve Smith 141* (326) Stuart Broad 3/49 (25 overs) 195 (71.4 overs) Joe Root 51 (104) Josh Hazlewood 3/46 (16 overs) 0/173 (50 overs) David Warner 87* (119) Australia won by 10 wickets The Gabba, Brisbane Umpires: Aleem Dar (Pak) and Marais Erasmus (SA) Player of the match: Steve Smith (Aus) England won the toss and elected to bat.
