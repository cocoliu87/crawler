Originally, the competition was to be played from 9 February to 26 March 2023.[7][8] In July 2020, it was announced that the tournament would be moved to October and November as a result of the qualification schedule being disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[9][10] The ICC released the tournament schedule on 27 June 2023.[11] Semi-finals were played in Mumbai and Kolkata while the final was held in Ahmedabad.[12] India secured a place in the final for the fourth time,[13] with their last appearance occurring in 2011 when they emerged victorious against Sri Lanka in Mumbai. Their previous appearances in the final were in 2003 against Australia at Johannesburg and in 1983 against West Indies at Lord's.[14] Australia qualified for a record eighth time in the final, having won five (1987, 1999, 2003, 2007, and 2015) and lost two (1975 and 1996).[15] It was the second time that India and Australia played a World Cup final against each other, the previous one being in 2003.[16] Route to the final Main article: 2023 Cricket World Cup group stage Each team played the other nine teams in the group stage; the top four teams advanced to the semi-finals.[17] India Round Australia Opponent Result Group stage Opponent Result Australia Won by 6 wickets Match 1 India Lost by 6 wickets Afghanistan Won by 8 wickets Match 2 South Africa Lost by 134 runs Pakistan Won by 7 wickets Match 3 Sri Lanka Won by 5 wickets Bangladesh Won by 7 wickets Match 4 Pakistan Won by 62 runs New Zealand Won by 4 wickets Match 5 Netherlands Won by 309 runs England Won by 100 runs Match 6 New Zealand Won by 5 runs Sri Lanka Won by 302 runs Match 7 England Won by 33 runs South Africa Won by 243 runs Match 8 Afghanistan Won by 3 wickets Netherlands Won by 160 runs Match 9 Bangladesh Won by 8 wickets 1st Place Group stage positions 3rd Place Opponent Result Knockout stage Opponent Result New Zealand India won by 70 runs Semi-finals South Africa Australia won by 3 wickets Source: ICC [17] Match Match officials On 17 November 2023, the International Cricket Council (ICC) named England's Richard Illingworth and Richard Kettleborough as the on-field umpires, with West Indies' Joel Wilson as the third umpire, New Zealand's Chris Gaffaney as the reserve umpire, and Zimbabwe's Andy Pycroft as match referee.[18][19] Kettleborough stood as the on-field umpire in the final for the second time, after 2015, while Illingworth, who played in the 1992 Cricket World Cup final, became the second person after Sri Lanka's Kumar Dharmasena to feature in the final of the World Cup as both a player and an umpire.[20] Teams and toss Both teams remained unchanged from their semi-final matches.[21] Australia won the toss and decided to field first.[22] India innings India made a quick start to their innings, with captain Rohit Sharma hitting 47 from 31 balls, but then lost Shubman Gill, Rohit and Shreyas Iyer in quick succession to leave themselves 81/3.[23] Virat Kohli and K. L. Rahul added 67 for the fourth wicket, before Kohli was out for 54.[23] India continued to add runs slowly, but Rahul was dismissed for 66 to leave India 203/6, and the remaining batsmen were not able to score quickly, the innings ending when Kuldeep Yadav was dismissed from the last ball of the 50th over with the score on 240.[23] Australia innings Australia made a poor start to their innings, losing three batsmen for 47 runs inside the first seven overs.[23] However, Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne then built a partnership, adding 192 runs in 36 overs; Australia were within two runs of victory when Head was dismissed by Mohammed Siraj for 137.[23] Glenn Maxwell was the next batsman in, and hit the winning two runs off the next ball, to give Australia a 6-wicket victory.[23] Match details 19 November 2023 14:00 (D/N) Scorecard India 240 (50 overs) v Australia 241/4 (43 overs) KL Rahul 66 (107) Mitchell Starc 3/55 (10 overs) Travis Head 137 (120) Jasprit Bumrah 2/43 (9 overs) Australia won by 6 wickets Narendra Modi Stadium, Ahmedabad Umpires: Richard Illingworth (Eng) and Richard Kettleborough (Eng) Player of the match: Travis Head (Aus) Australia won the toss and elected to field Final scorecard 1st innings India batting[24] Player Status Runs Balls 4s 6s Strike rate Rohit Sharma c Head b Maxwell 47 31 4 3 151.61 Shubman Gill c Zampa b Starc 4 7 0 0 57.14 Virat Kohli b Cummins 54 63 4 0 85.71 Shreyas Iyer c †Inglis b Cummins 4 3 1 0 133.33 KL Rahul c †Inglis b Starc 66 107 1 0 61.68 Ravindra Jadeja c †Inglis b Hazlewood 9 22 0 0 40.90 Suryakumar Yadav c †Inglis b Hazlewood 18 28 1 0 64.28 Mohammed Shami c †Inglis b Starc 6 10 1 0 60.00 Jasprit Bumrah lbw b Zampa 1 3 0 0 33.33 Kuldeep Yadav run out (Labuschagne/Cummins) 10 18 0 0 55.55 Mohammed Siraj not out 9 8 1 0 112.50 Extras (lb 3, w 9) 12 Total (10 wickets; 50 overs) 240 13 3 Fall of wickets: 1/30 (Gill, 4.2 ov), 2/76 (Rohit, 9.4 ov), 3/81 (Iyer, 10.2 ov), 4/148 (Kohli, 28.3 ov), 5/178 (Jadeja, 35.5 ov), 6/203 (Rahul, 41.3 ov), 7/211 (Shami, 43.4 ov), 8/214 (Bumrah, 44.5 ov), 9/226 (Yadav, 47.3 ov), 10/240 (Kuldeep, 49.6 ov) Australia bowling[24] Bowler Overs Maidens Runs Wickets Econ Wides NBs Mitchell Starc 10 0 55 3 5.50 3 0 Josh Hazlewood 10 0 60 2 6.00 1 0 Glenn Maxwell 6 0 35 1 5.83 0 0 Pat Cummins 10 0 34 2 3.40 2 0 Adam Zampa 10 0 44 1 4.40 1 0 Mitchell Marsh 2 0 5 0 2.50 0 0 Travis Head 2 0 4 0 2.00 0 0 2nd innings Australia batting[24] Player Status Runs Balls 4s 6s Strike rate David Warner c Kohli b Shami 7 3 1 0 233.33 Travis Head c Gill b Siraj 137 120 15 4 114.16 Mitchell Marsh c Rahul b Bumrah 15 15 1 1 100.00 Steve Smith lbw b Bumrah 4 9 1 0 44.44 Marnus Labuschagne not out 58 110 4 0 52.72 Glenn Maxwell not out 2 1 0 0 200.00 Josh Inglis Mitchell Starc Pat Cummins Adam Zampa Josh Hazlewood Extras (b 5, lb 2, w 11) 18 Total (4; 43 overs) 241 22 5 Fall of wickets: 1/16 (Warner, 1.1 ov), 2/41 (Marsh, 4.3 ov), 3/47 (Smith, 6.6 ov), 4/239 (Head, 42.5 ov) India bowling[24] Bowler Overs Maidens Runs Wickets Econ Wides NBs Jasprit Bumrah 9 2 43 2 4.77 0 0 Mohammed Shami 7 1 47 1 6.71 3 0 Ravindra Jadeja 10 0 43 0 4.30 1 0 Kuldeep Yadav 10 0 56 0 5.60 0 0 Mohammed Siraj 7 0 45 1 6.42 0 0 Broadcasting The final match was broadcast live in India on Star Sports, free-to-air broadcaster DD Sports and free on OTT platform Disney+ Hotstar.
