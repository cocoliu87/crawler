The combatants were elements of the Russian Armed Forces and Ukrainian Armed Forces. The battle lasted from 25 February 2022 to 2 April 2022 and ended with the withdrawal of Russian forces. Initially, Russian forces captured key areas to the north and west of Kyiv, leading to international prediction of the city's imminent fall. However, stiff Ukrainian resistance sapped Russian momentum. Poor Russian logistics and tactical decisions helped the defenders to thwart efforts at encirclement, and, after a month of protracted fighting, Ukrainian forces began counterattacking. During peace talks in Istanbul on 29 March, the Russian delegation declared they would drastically scale down military activity near Kyiv and Chernihiv.[34] Four days later, the Ukrainian authorities declared that Kyiv and the surrounding Kyiv Oblast were again under Ukrainian control. First Russian attack (25–27 February 2022) Russian forces engaged Ukrainian troops at Hostomel Airport on 24 February 2022. A key supply point for Russian troops near Kyiv, the airport, located in Hostomel, a town northwest of the city, was captured the following day.[35] Territorial Defense Forces troops in Kyiv, 25 February Russian infiltration and initial Ukrainian mobilization On the morning of 25 February, three Russian saboteurs, dressed as Ukrainian soldiers, entered Obolon District, 10 kilometres (6 mi) north of the Verkhovna Rada building, the seat of the parliament of Ukraine.[36][37] They were killed by Ukrainian forces afterwards.[38][39] Several hours later, a Ukrainian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter aircraft piloted by Colonel Oleksandr Oksanchenko was shot down over the city and crashed into an apartment building.[31] Throughout the day, gunfire was heard at several wards of the city. Ukrainian officials described the gunfire as arising from clashes with Russian forces.[40][41] There was heavy gunfire in the city during the night. Ukrainian forces later claimed to have killed around 60 Russian saboteurs during the process.[27] Escalation Aftermath of the missile strike on an apartment block in Kyiv on 26 February 2022 On the morning of 26 February, Russian artillery shelled the city for more than 30 minutes.[42] Concurrently, Ukrainian forces repelled an attack on a power plant in the northeastern neighborhood of Troieshchyna. The attack was suggested to be a Russian attempt to cut Kyiv off from electricity.[43] Heavy fighting also occurred near the Kyiv Zoo in Shuliavka, where Ukrainian forces defended an army base on Prospect Peremohy.[44] According to President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukrainian forces managed to repel a Russian offensive and continued to hold Kyiv and its surrounding areas. A curfew was imposed from 17:00 to 08:00, and violators were to be considered saboteurs.[45] According to the British Ministry of Defence, Russian forces were 31 kilometres (19 mi) from the city-center of Kyiv.[46] On 27 February, clashes between Ukrainian forces and Russian saboteurs continued. Meanwhile, local officials remained adamant that the city was still under full Ukrainian control.[47] Later that morning, a rocket fell and exploded in the courtyard of a 16-story highrise in Troieshchyna, destroying several automobiles.[48] Ukrainian officials allege that the missile was fired by a Russian strategic bomber[clarification needed] from Belarus.[49][50] By the evening, the Associated Press reported that mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko had stated the city was encircled,[51] which was subsequently clarified by his spokesperson as a mistake in The Kyiv Independent. The report has since been classified as false information.[52] During the night, a Russian convoy attempted to set up a temporary base at Syrets Metro, which was met with a deadly confrontation with Ukrainian troops. Russian troops also fired at a Ukrainian military bus, creating an unknown amount of casualties.[53] Civilian responses During the start of the attack Klitschko vowed to take up arms and fight.[54] Zelenskyy urged citizens of Kyiv to respond to the Russian assault with improvised attacks using Molotov cocktails.[55][56] Residents were warned to avoid windows and balconies.[43] 18,000 guns were distributed amongst citizens during the first day of the battle, while the Ukrainian Territorial Defense Forces, normally kept in reserve, were activated upon the start of the attack.[25] On 26 February, Ukrainian interior minister Denys Monastyrsky announced that civilian volunteers in Kyiv had been given more than 25,000 assault rifles, and approximately 10 million bullets, as well as rocket-propelled grenades and rocket launchers.[57] Second Russian attack See also: Russian Kyiv Convoy Russian convoy and continuous shelling On 28 February, a fresh wave of Russian troops advanced towards Kyiv, but little direct combat occurred, with only three missiles being fired at the city that day.[58][59] Satellite images revealed the existence of a long column of Russian vehicles heading to Kyiv along a 64-kilometre-long (40 mi) highway approaching Kyiv from the north, and was approximately 39 km (24 mi) from the center of Kyiv.[60][61][62] Ukrainian soldiers killed an Israeli-Ukrainian citizen at a checkpoint, mistaking him for a Chechen member of the Russian army.[63][64] A building in Kyiv destroyed by Russian shelling Rocket strike on Kyiv TV Tower, 1 March On the morning of 1 March, the Russian Ministry of Defense issued an evacuation notice to l contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 55 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Battle_of_Kyiv_(2022) responseCode 3 200
