How about: Private Lynndie England of the U.S. Army is found guilty by a military jury in charges related to torture and prisoner abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison. -- 199.71.174.100 23:47, 26 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Posted. The suggested image is too graphic for the MainPage, IMO, hence not used. -- PFHLai 05:43, 27 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Weapons decomissioning. Northern Ireland peace process: Chairman John de Chastelain of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning announces that the weapons, ammunition, and explosives of the Provisional Irish Republican Army have been "put beyond use". -- PFHLai (Not sure if the updates in Wikipedia are detailed enough yet.) 18:46, 26 September 2005 (UTC) -- C'mon, sure that's enough detail, but we'll need a better image, methinks .... -- 199.71.174.100 23:47, 26 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Posted. The suggested image is not really that relevant to the Provisional IRA, hence not used. -- PFHLai 05:43, 27 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] September 25 As citizens in Poland vote in their parlimentary elections today, polls predict a crushing defeat of the ruling Democratic Left Alliance by a right-wing coalition of Citizens Platform and Law and Justice. The reason I included the poll tidbit is because the ruling coalition is predicted by some to not even be able to get enough votes to enter parliament this time. That's really bad for a ruling coalition. --Kitch 23:18, 24 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] September 24 Hurricane Rita makes landfall around 2:36AM CDT (0736 UTC), at Sabine Pass, Texas. --Kitch 10:41, 24 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Sydney Swans win over West Coast Eagles!

(IMO: Probably better to merge the two articles before posting on the Frontpage.) -- 199.71.174.100 13:47, 23 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Yuriy Yekhanurov becomes the new Prime Minister of Ukraine after two rounds of voting in parliament. (This would probably make more sense as Yuri Yehanurov is now a redirect page. Also, a picture of Yekhanurov might be more fitting than the flag of Urkraine) -Nameneko 23:08, 23 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Posted. Pic of Yehanurov not used as I'm not sure if it's free. Flag not used either as Hurricane Rita is still the top news -- updated earlier today, after Yehanurov became PM yesterday. -- PFHLai 01:36, 24 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] September 21 Jet Blue Flight 292 en route to New York from Burbank, California, encountered nose gear malfunctions shortly after takeoff: the nose gear had been rotated 90 degrees to the right. It then circled around Los Angeles in an attempt to burn off fuel in preperation for an emergency landing at LAX. Removed. (not by me) -- PFHLai 04:55, 22 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Somehow the UK forces storm an Iraq police prison story, got put in the Iraq war article, which is not about current events and it has been deleted there. There is no reason to think this news event will be significant enough to merit inclusision in an article summarizing the Iraq war. Please find another article for this news event.--Silverback 11:00, 21 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Removed. -- PFHLai 17:19, 21 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] September 19 Disagreements arise between North Korea and the United States, only a day after the former committed to abandon all nuclear weapons programs. -- Gazpacho 18:36, 20 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] I've modified the existing blurb rather than adding a new one.--Pharos 18:48, 20 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Predicted path of Tropical Storm Rita Predicted path of Tropical Storm Rita Tropical Storm Rita is forecast to become a major hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico in the next few days, prompting mayor Ray Nagin to suspend the re-opening of New Orleans, the city that was recently devastated by Hurricane Katrina. -- 199.71.174.100 03:16, 20 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] I've added this with different wording, as Rita now has become a hurricane.--Pharos 18:48, 20 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Thanks for posting and updating. -- 199.71.174.100 21:54, 20 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] September 18 38th German federal election, 2005 today! That's not written terribly well for inclusion on the front page. Try this on for size: Germany goes to the polls in the German federal elction, with Gerhard Schröder's SDP and Angela Merkel's CDU currently neck and neck for control of the Bundestag. --Kitch 01:41, 18 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] it was a reminding, not a final text. I leave it up to the sysop making the update how to phrase it. Myself I have no possibility for editing the main page. Probably best to wait till we have the results at the end of today. In the meantime, the Afghan election gets to be the top news for a few hours. -- PFHLai 08:23, 18 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Afghanistan goes to the polls in the in the first elections in over 30 years to vote for the Wolesi Jirga and provincial councils, in the midst of violence and turmoil. Gerrit CUTEDH 06:58, 18 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Posted a shorter version. -- PFHLai 08:23, 18 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] September 14 The Massachusetts General Court rejects a proposed amendment to ban Same-sex marriage in Massachusetts by a vote of 157-39, meaning that Massachusetts will remain the only state in the United States to allow gay marraige. September 12 The Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, the fifth in the world and the second in Asia, is officially opened. — Instantnood 17:09, 14 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] I'll pass on this one. Too much like free advertising for Disney on the MainPage. -- PFHLai 17:29, 14 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Confirmation hearings continue regarding the nomination of John Roberts to serve as Chief Justice of the United States, with Roberts answering questions regarding citizens' right to privacy, civil rights in wartime, torture, and the role of international law in interpreting the US Constitution. Mamawrites 06:00, 14 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Probably better to wait till a decision is made regarding the nomination, IMO. -- PFHLai 13:11, 14 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] I agree; generally we should be reporting decisive events, not "in progress" stories, especially when the ongoing event is of limited international interest.--Pharos 13:50, 14 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Flag of Norway With most of the votes counted in the Norwegian parliamentary election Jens Stoltenberg is set to become the countries next Prime Minister.--nixie 23:10, 12 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] How about this: The Red-Green Coalition led by former Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg wins the Norwegian parliamentary election. -- 199.71.174.100 00:20, 13 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Posted. -- PFHLai 04:35, 2005 September 13 (UTC) The Ashes urn Cricket: Thanks to a day of solid batting, England ensure a draw with Australia in the fifth and final test match, thus taking the 2005 Ashes series 2-1-2 and winning back the Ashes (right) for the first time since 1987. Oops, I foolishly posted this below, not noticing that it's a new day today. Thanks to 199.71.174.100 for adding the image.

It's official now. (Needless to say, this replaces the below.) Doops | talk 17:16, 12 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] The 2005 Ashes series reaches its climax at the Oval in London. England are 40 runs ahead with 9 wickets remaining with 98 overs to go against Australia to win cricket's greatest prize. The Ashes, cricket's greatest prize, has been avidly followed not only in the United Kingdom and Australia, but also in the West Indies, South Africa and India. This has been, almost universally recognised as the greatest-ever cricket series. Its conclusion is v important, jguk 18:40, 11 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] The series isn't even over yet. I guess we might have a blurb at the conclusion for "parity" with the earlier Superbowl blurb, but in future I think the Olynpics should generally be the only sports event on here.--Pharos 19:27, 11 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] As far as I can remember from last Summer, the Olympics get their own ITN on the MainPage when the games are held, and thus IMO, should probably stay off the regular ITN. -- PFHLai 13:22, 2005 September 12 (UTC) The Norwegian parliamentary election, 2005: Norway goes to the polls to elect a new Storting for a four-year term in what pollsters forecast will be a very close election.
