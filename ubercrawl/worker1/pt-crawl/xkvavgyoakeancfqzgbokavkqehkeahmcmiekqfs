Please remove this notice when the backlog is cleared. Shortcuts WP:PNT WP:QTN "WP:NOTENGLISH" redirects here. For information about non-English sources, see Wikipedia:Verifiability § Non-English sources. See also: Wikipedia:Translation, Category:Wikipedia articles needing translation, Category:AfC submissions declined as not in English, and Wikipedia:Typo Team/moss/not English This encyclopedia is written in English (see Main Page#Wikipedia languages). With this being said, this page is a place to list articles written in languages other than English, to see if they can be translated before they are listed at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion. If someone speaks the language the article is written in and can state that it is not worth translating, the item should be moved to AfD or tagged with {{prod}}. Please keep in mind that drafts are considered out of scope for this page. If an article has been listed here for two weeks and is still untranslated, it should be removed from Wikipedia following one of the processes laid out in our deletion policy. How to help[edit] There are two main ways you can help this project: Find pages that need translation or proofreading, and add them to the list on this page. See #Standard procedures below for how to do this. Find a page that is already in the list (see #Translated pages that could still use some cleanup) and help translate it. Or, pick a random article that needs cleanup which has been translated from one of these languages, and fix that article: Albanian Arabic Belarusian Bosnian Bulgarian Catalan Chinese Croatian Dutch Farsi French Finnish German Greek Hindi Hungarian Indonesian Italian Japanese Korean Norwegian Polish Portuguese Punjabi Romanian Russian Serbian Slovak Spanish Turkish Ukrainian Vietnamese Note: you can click the same language multiple times, and it will give you a different article each time you click it (if there is more than one for that language). You can also view a list of all articles in need of post-translation cleanup for a given language at these links: Albanian, Arabic, Belarusian, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, Croatian, Dutch, Farsi, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Spanish, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese. Standard procedures[edit] If you are here for the first time and have an article in a language other than English or a poorly translated article that you wish to list here to forestall possible deletion, you should start by finding the most appropriate template from among the ones listed at Wikipedia:Template messages/Translation and add it to the article page, save the page, and then follow the instructions in the banner on how to list the article here. You might need to click '[show]' to see all the instructions. If you want to ask for a translation into English of an article from another language's Wikipedia, go to Wikipedia:Translation. Listing a page here Most pages get listed here by subst'ing a {{Needtrans}} template, following the instructions given at any one of several translation-related templates that are added to the article page. Many of the templates found at Wikipedia:Template messages/Translation propose adding the corresponding article here. See section Translation template usage below for details of the templates available for use on the main article page. Other ways to find articles for inclusion on this page are: Find articles in a specific language category under Category:Expand by language Wikipedia templates. For example, Template:Expand Spanish puts articles into Category:Articles needing translation from Spanish Wikipedia. Monitor Recent changes tagged with ContentTranslation keyword Tagging If the article is a mere copy of (all or part of) an article in another language's Wikipedia, it can just be tagged with {{db-foreign}} to get added to Wikipedia:Candidates for speedy deletion: we want to discourage people who cut articles from one Wikipedia and paste to another without translating. You can leave a message on the contributing user's talk-page in their own language, using the templates from WP:PNT/Templates for user talk pages or using {{UE}}; this will point them to the appropriate Wikipedia in the language they used. Replacement and restoration Sometimes, legitimate articles are replaced by content in other languages. In this case, the last English-language version should be restored from the history. In addition, you may leave a message on the user's talk-page as indicated above. Notification When listing a page here, you might want to find the Wikipedia:Embassy, Ambassador, or Wikipedia:Local embassy member of the Wikipedia that relates to the language the article is in and invite them to move the page to their own Wikipedia. If you don't even know what language the article is in you could use Language recognition chart, and if that fails, some language identification web site, such as Xerox or What Language Is This? to find out. If you have come here from another Wikipedia, please note on this page what you think should be done with the article. Deletion If an article has been listed here for two weeks and is still untranslated, it should be nominated for deletion. (See also Guide to deletion.) Articles that are not in English are still subject to all other forms of speedy deletion should they meet the criteria, and can be nominated for deletion by prod or afd should an editor feel they warrant deletion for a reason other than the language it is in, an article not being in English is not itself a criterion for deletion until the two week period has passed. Also, articles in other languages are still subject to blp prod. After translation When a page listed here has been translated, its entry should be removed (or moved to section Cleanup if the translation needs another pair of eyes). There are also procedures to follow at the Talk page of the article itself; see template {{translated page}} and Wikipedia:Translation#How to translate. Translation template usage[edit] Various templates are available to tag the article page needing translator attention, and one template is available for use here at WP:PNT. The following templates are available to tag articles with translation issues in preparation for listing the article at WP:PNT: {{notenglish}} – "This page is written in a language other than English..." {{cleanup-translation}} – "contains translated text and needs attention..." {{hidden translation}} – "an earlier translated version may have introduced errors of fact..." {{rough translation}} – "may have been generated by a computer or by a translator without dual proficiency" {{translate passage}} – "A passage needs to be translated from Language into English" {{not English inline}} – "[needs Eng. translation]" after a phrase The following templates are available for use at WP:PNT to add an entry linking to the article having the translation issue: {{Needtrans}} {{Duflu}} – deprecated; now redirects to Needtrans. These templates, and other templates relating to translation issues outside the scope of WP:PNT can be found at Wikipedia:Template messages/Translation. Templates for article pages One of the following templates should be used at the top of the article page: Not English Template {{not English}} (alias: {{notenglish}}) is available for a page that needs translation in its entirety (so it would be appropriate to delete if not fixed): 1. Use the notice {{notenglish|NameOfLanguage}} if you know the language used, or {{notenglish}} if you cannot identify the language of the page in question. 2. Add a mention to the list of pages needing translation, using {{Needtrans}} as detailed below. 3. You may also choose to warn the contributing editor with {{uw-english}}, the "use English" warning, or suggest submitting it to a different language Wikipedia with {{contrib-xx1}}, where xx is the language code (see available templates). An alternate template for identifying the article as having been listed here is {{uw-notenglish}}. Bilingual versions of this template have been created for Norwegian, Spanish, Polish, and French. See the note on these at {{uw-notenglish}}. Not English section If there is just a section that needs translation: 1. Use the notice {{Not English|NameOfLanguage|section}}, with the word "section" as a second unnamed parameter at the beginning of the non-English content. 2. Add a mention on this page, as above. 3. You may wish to place a note on the talk pages of contributors of non-English material, saying that English Wikipedia is meant for English-language content, inviting them to translate it, and, if appropriate, suggesting the location of the Wikipedia edition for the language in question should they wish to post content in that language. Cleanup translation Template {{cleanup translation}} (alias: {{cleanup-translation}}) is available if the article has been translated, but needs attention from someone approaching dual fluency in both languages: 1. Use the notice {{cleanup-translation}}. 2. Add a mention to the translation cleanup section. Hidden translation Template {{Hidden translation}} is available if the article was translated at an earlier point and contained factual errors, while subsequent edits fixed up the English without fixing the errors of fact. The article now looks good and not "machine-translated" anymore, but the original errors of fact are still there, papered over with a facade of good English. 1. Use the notice {{Hidden translation}}, for example, {{Hidden translation|lang-name|version-nbr}} 2. Add a mention to the translation cl contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 82 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Wikipedia:Pages_needing_translation_into_English responseCode 3 200
