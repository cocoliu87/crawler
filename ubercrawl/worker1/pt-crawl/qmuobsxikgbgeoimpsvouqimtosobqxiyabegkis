India were the defending champions,[3] and retained their title, after beating Bangladesh by three wickets in the final.[4] The five full members of the Asian Cricket Council took part in the tournament: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. They were joined by Hong Kong, who won the 2018 Asia Cup Qualifier tournament.[5] Hong Kong had lost their ODI status after finishing tenth in the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier in March.[6][7] However, on 9 September 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) awarded ODI status to all matches in the tournament.[8] Background[edit] Originally, the tournament was scheduled to be played in India.[9][10] It was moved to the United Arab Emirates, following ongoing political tensions between India and Pakistan.[2] On 29 October 2015, following the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) meeting in Singapore, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary stated that the 2018 edition of the tournament would be held in India.[11] In August 2017, the BCCI sought government clearance to host the tournament, after the 2017 ACC Under-19 Asia Cup was moved to Malaysia.[12] In April 2018, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, asked if the BCCI and ACC would consider hosting the tournament in Abu Dhabi, in a bid to ensure Pakistan's participation.[13] Pakistan were scheduled to host the 2018 ACC Emerging Teams Asia Cup ahead of the tournament in April.[14] With the announcement that the Asia Cup would be played in the United Arab Emirates, the Emerging Teams Asia Cup was moved to December 2018, with Sri Lanka co-hosting the tournament with Pakistan.[2] Format[edit] The schedule and format of the tournament was announced on 24 July 2018, with the six teams split into two groups of three.[15] The top two teams from each of the groups progressed to the Super Four section of the tournament.[15] From there, the top two teams of the Super Four section played each other in the final.[15] Initially, the team that finishes second in Group A were scheduled to play their first Super Four game in Abu Dhabi. However, India would be based in Dubai, irrespective of where they finish in the pool.[16] On 19 September 2018, the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) revised the schedule for the Super Four section[17] The captains of Bangladesh and Pakistan were both critical of the ACC's new schedule.[18][19] Teams[edit] Afghanistan, ICC Full Member Bangladesh, ICC Full Member India, ICC Full Member Pakistan, ICC Full Member Sri Lanka, ICC Full Member Hong Kong, 2018 Asia Cup Qualifier Squads[edit] Afghanistan[20] (12) Bangladesh[21] (11) Hong Kong[22] (19) India[23] (1) Pakistan[24] (8) Sri Lanka[25] (3) Asghar Afghan (c) Javed Ahmadi Munir Ahmad Yamin Ahmadzai Aftab Alam Ihsanullah Rashid Khan Wafadar Momand Mohammad Nabi Gulbadin Naib Rahmat Shah Hashmatullah Shahidi Mohammad Shahzad (wk) Samiullah Shinwari Sayed Shirzad Mujeeb Ur Rahman Najibullah Zadran Mashrafe Mortaza (c) Shakib Al Hasan (vc) Litton Das Ariful Haque Mominul Haque Abu Hider Rubel Hossain Tamim Iqbal Nazmul Islam Imrul Kayes Mahmudullah Mehidy Hasan Miraz Mohammad Mithun Mushfiqur Rahim (wk) Mustafizur Rahman Mosaddek Hossain Soumya Sarkar Najmul Hossain Shanto Anshuman Rath (c) Tanwir Afzal Nadeem Ahmed Tanveer Ahmed Haroon Arshad Christopher Carter Babar Hayat Aftab Hussain Raag Kapur Aizaz Khan Ehsan Khan Nizakat Khan Waqas Khan Cameron McAuslan Scott McKechnie Ehsan Nawaz Kinchit Shah Rohit Sharma (c) Shikhar Dhawan (vc) Khaleel Ahmed Jasprit Bumrah Yuzvendra Chahal Deepak Chahar MS Dhoni (wk)[n 1] Kedar Jadhav Ravindra Jadeja Dinesh Karthik (wk) Siddarth Kaul Bhuvneshwar Kumar KL Rahul Manish Pandey Ambati Rayudu Kuldeep Yadav Hardik Pandya Axar Patel Shardul Thakur Sarfaraz Ahmed (c, wk) Shaheen Afridi Asif Ali Hasan Ali Mohammad Amir Faheem Ashraf Babar Azam Junaid Khan Shadab Khan Usman Khan Shoaib Malik Shan Masood Mohammad Nawaz Haris Sohail Imam-ul-Haq Fakhar Zaman Angelo Mathews (c) Amila Aponso Dushmantha Chameera Dinesh Chandimal (wk) Akila Dananjaya Niroshan Dickwella (wk) Danushka Gunathilaka Shehan Jayasuriya Suranga Lakmal Lasith Malinga Kusal Mendis Dilruwan Perera Kusal Perera (wk) Thisara Perera Kasun Rajitha Dasun Shanaka Dhananjaya de Silva Upul Tharanga Before the start of the tournament, Wafadar Momand was ruled out of Afghanistan's squad due to injury and was replaced by Yamin Ahmadzai,[26] and Mominul Haque was added to Bangladesh's squad.[27] Dinesh Chandimal and Danushka Gunathilaka were ruled out of Sri Lanka's squad due to injury.
