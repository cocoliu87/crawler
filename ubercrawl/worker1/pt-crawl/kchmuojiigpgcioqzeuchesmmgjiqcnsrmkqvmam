They have primary objectives to promote economic integration and cooperation among its members, ensure that the benefits of integration are equitably shared, and coordinate foreign policy. The organisation was established in 1973,[11] with its four founding members signing the Treaty of Chaguaramas. Its primary activities involve: Coordinating economic policies and development planning. Devising and instituting special projects for the less-developed countries within its jurisdiction. Operating as a regional single market for many of its members (Caricom Single Market). Handling regional trade disputes. The secretariat headquarters is in Georgetown, Guyana. CARICOM is an official United Nations Observer beneficiary.[12] CARICOM was established by the English-speaking parts of the Caribbean and currently includes all the independent Anglophone island countries plus Belize, Guyana and Montserrat, as well as all other British Caribbean territories and Bermuda as associate members. English was its sole working language into the 1990s. The organisation became multilingual with the addition of Dutch-speaking Suriname in 1995 and the French and Haitian Creole-speaking Haiti in 2002. Furthermore, it added Spanish as the fourth official language in 2003.[3] In July 2012, CARICOM announced they considered making French and Dutch official languages.[13] In 2001, the heads of government signed a revised Treaty of Chaguaramas[14] that cleared the way to transform the idea of a common market CARICOM into the Caribbean (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy. Part of the revised treaty establishes and implements the Caribbean Court of Justice. History[edit] CARICOM, originally the Caribbean Community and Common Market, was established by the Treaty of Chaguaramas[15] which took effect on 1 August 1973. The first four signatories were Barbados, Jamaica, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago. CARICOM superseded the 1965–1972 Caribbean Free Trade Association (CARIFTA) organised to provide a continued economic linkage between the English-speaking countries of the Caribbean after the dissolution of the West Indies Federation, which lasted from 3 January 1958 to 31 May 1962. A revised Treaty of Chaguaramas established the Caribbean Community including the CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME) and was signed by the CARICOM Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community on 5 July 2001 at their Twenty-Second Meeting of the Conference in Nassau, The Bahamas.[16] The revised treaty cleared the way to transform the idea of a common market CARICOM into the Caribbean (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy. Haiti's membership in CARICOM remained effectively suspended from 29 February 2004 through early June 2006 following the 2004 Haitian coup d'état and the removal of Jean-Bertrand Aristide from the presidency.[17][18] CARICOM announced that no democratically elected government in CARICOM should have its leader deposed. The fourteen other heads of government sought to have Aristide fly from Africa to Jamaica and share his account of events with them, which infuriated the interim Haitian prime minister, Gérard Latortue, who announced he would take steps to take Haiti out of CARICOM.[19] CARICOM thus voted on suspending the participation of Haitian officials from the councils of CARICOM.[20][21] Following the presidential election of René Préval, Haitian officials were readmitted and Préval himself gave the opening address at the CARICOM Council of Ministers meeting in July.[22][23] Since 2013 the CARICOM-bloc and with the Dominican Republic have been tied to the European Union via an Economic Partnership Agreements signed in 2008 known as CARIFORUM.[24] The treaty grants all members of the European Union and CARIFORUM equal rights in terms of trade and investment. Under Article 234 of the agreement, the European Court of Justice handles dispute resolution between CARIFORUM and European Union states.[25] Membership[edit] See also: Member states of the Caribbean Community As of 2016[update] CARICOM has 15 full members, five associate members and eight observers. All associate members are British Overseas Territories, and it is currently not established what the role of the associate members will be. The observers are states which engage in at least one of CARICOM's technical committees.[26][page needed] CARICOM members Status Name Join date Notes Full member Antigua and Barbuda 4 July 1974 The Bahamas 4 July 1983 Not a part of the customs union Barbados 1 August 1973 One of the four founding members Belize 1 May 1974 Dominica Grenada Guyana 1 August 1973 One of the four founding members Haiti 2 July 2002 Provisional membership on 4 July 1998 Jamaica 1 August 1973 One of the four founding members Montserrat 1 May 1974 British overseas territory Saint Kitts and Nevis 26 July 1974 Joined as Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla Saint Lucia 1 May 1974 Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 1 May 1974 Suriname 4 July 1995 Trinidad and Tobago 1 August 1973 One of the four founding members Associate Anguilla July 1999 British overseas territory Bermuda 2 July 2003 British Virgin Islands July 1991 Cayman Islands 16 May 2002 Turks and Caicos Islands July 1991 Observer Aruba Constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands Colombia Curaçao Constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands Dominican Republic Mexico Puerto Rico Unincorporated territory of the United States Sint Maarten Constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands Venezuela Relationship with Cuba[edit] In 2017 the Republic of Cuba and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) signed the "CARICOM-Cuba Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement"[27] to facilitate closer trade ties.[28] In December, 2022 President of the Republic of Cuba, H.E. Miguel Díaz-Canel met in Bridgetown, Barbados with the Heads of State and Government of CARICOM. On the occasion of the 8th CARICOM-Cuba Summit to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations with the independent States of CARICOM and Cuba and the 20th Anniversary of CARICOM-Cuba Day. Cuba also accepted CARICOM's offer to deepen bilateral cooperation and to join robust discussions in the bloc's regional 'Joint Ministerial Taskforce on Food production and Security'. Organizational Structure[edit] Structures comprised by the overall Caribbean Community (CARICOM).[29] Under Article 4 CARICOM breaks its 15 member states into two groups: Less Developed Countries (LDCs) and More Developed Countries (MDCs).[16] The countries of CARICOM which are designated as Less Developed Countries (LDCs) are:[16] Antigua and Barbuda Belize Commonwealth of Dominica Grenada Republic of Haiti Montserrat Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis St Lucia St Vincent and the Grenadines The countries of CARICOM which are designated as More Developed Countries (MDCs) are:[16] Commonwealth of The Bahamas  contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 53 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Caribbean_Community responseCode 3 200
