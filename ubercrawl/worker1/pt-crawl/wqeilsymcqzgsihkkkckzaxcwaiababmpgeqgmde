The original KNDO fought against the government of Myanmar from 1947 until 1949 as the armed wing of the KNU, until the KNLA was made the official armed wing.[4][1] The KNDO closely followed the peace process instigated by the government, starting with the call for a nationwide ceasefire by the Ethnic Armed Organisations (EAOs) in 2011. On 11 October 2015, the KNDO released a statement on the recently signed Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement.[5] References[edit] ^ a b Pike, John.
