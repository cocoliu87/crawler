At the end of 2014, it was estimated there were 38.2 million IDPs worldwide, the highest level since 1989, the first year for which global statistics on IDPs are available. As of 3 May 2022,[update] the countries with the largest IDP populations were Ukraine (8 million),[4][5][6][7] Syria (7.6 million), Ethiopia (5.5 million),[8] the Democratic Republic of the Congo (5.2 million), Colombia (4.9 million),[9] Yemen (4.3 million),[10] Afghanistan (3.8 million),[11] Iraq (3.6 million), Sudan (2.2 million), South Sudan (1.9 million), Pakistan (1.4 million), Nigeria (1.2 million) and Somalia (1.1 million).[12] The United Nations and the UNHCR support monitoring and analysis of worldwide IDPs through the Geneva-based Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre.[2][13] Definition[edit] Whereas 'refugee' has an authoritative definition under the 1951 Refugee Convention, there is no universal legal definition of internally displaced persons (IDP); only a regional treaty for African countries (see Kampala Convention). However, a United Nations report, Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement uses the definition of: persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border.[14] While the above stresses two important elements of internal displacement (coercion and the domestic/internal movement), rather than a strict definition the Guiding Principles offer "a descriptive identification of the category of persons whose needs are the concern of the Guiding Principles".[15] In this way, the document "intentionally steers toward flexibility rather than legal precision"[16] as the words "in particular" indicate that the list of reasons for displacement is not exhaustive. However, as Erin Mooney has pointed out, "global statistics on internal displacement generally count only IDPs uprooted by conflict and human rights violations. Moreover, a recent study has recommended that the IDP concept should be defined even more narrowly, to be limited to persons displaced by violence."[17] This outlook has become outdated, however, as natural disasters and slow-onset climate degradation have become the primary driving force behind internal displacement in recent years, although conflict remains the primary reason for pre-existing IDPs overall. [18] Climate displaced IDPs are therefore being given more attention overall through being recorded in statistics. Thus, despite the non-exhaustive reasons for internal displacement, many consider IDPs as those who would be defined as refugees if they were to cross an international border, hence, the term refugees in all but the name is often applied to IDPs. IDP populations[edit] It is very difficult to get accurate figures for internally displaced persons because populations are not constant. IDPs may be returning home while others are fleeing, and others may periodically return to IDP camps to take advantage of humanitarian aid. While the case of IDPs in large camps such as those in Darfur, western Sudan, are relatively well-reported, it is very difficult to assess those IDPs who flee to larger towns and cities. It is necessary for many instances to supplement official figures with additional information obtained from operational humanitarian organizations on the ground. Thus, the 24.5 million figure must be treated as an estimate.[19] Additionally, most official figures only include those displaced by conflict or natural disasters. Development-induced IDPs often are not included in assessments. It has been estimated that between 70 and 80% of all IDPs are women and children.[20] 50% of internally displaced people and refugees were thought to be in urban areas in 2010, many of them in protracted displacement with little likelihood of ever returning home. A 2013 study found that these protracted urban displacements had not been given due weight by international aid and governance as historically they had focused on rural cam displacement responses.[21] The study argues that this protracted urban displacement needs a fundamental change in the approach to those who are displaced and their host societies. They note that re-framing responses to urban displacement will also involve human rights and development actors and local and national governments. They call for a change in the narrative around the issue is needed to reflect ingenuity and fortitude displayed by displaced populations, the opportunities for self-sufficiency and safety represented by urban areas, and that the displaced can make a contribution to their host societies.[21] An updated country by country breakdown can be found online.[22] UNHCR registered IDPs and people in IDP-like situations by country/territory between 2007 and 2014[23] Country/territory 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Afghanistan 129,300 153,700 230,700 297,100 351,900 447,500 486,300 631,300 Azerbaijan 686,600 686,600 603,300 586,000 592,900 599,200 600,300 609,000 Bosnia and Herzegovina 135,500 131,000 124,500 113,600 113,400 113,000 103,400 84,500 Burundi 13,900 100,000 100,000 100,000 157,200 78,800 78,900 78,900 CAR 147,000 197,000 197,000 197,000 192,500 106,200 51,700 894,400 Chad 112,700 178,900 166,700 170,500 231,000 124,000 90,000 19,800 Colombia 3,000,000 3,000,000 3,000,000 3,304,000 3,672,100 3,888,300 3,943,500 5,368,100 Congo 3,500 CÃ´te d'Ivoire 709,200 709,000 686,000 519,100 517,100 126,700 45,000 24,000 Croatia 4,000 2,900 2,500 2,300 2,100 DRC 1,075,300 1,317,900 1,460,100 2,050,700 1,721,400 1,709,300 2,669,100 2,963,800 Georgia 246,000 271,300 329,800 352,600 360,000 274,000 279,800 257,600 Iraq 1,834,400 2,481,000 2,647,300 1,552,000 1,343,600 1,332,400 1,131,800 954,100 Kenya 250,000 404,000 399,000 300,000 300,000 Kyrgyzstan 80,000 163,900 Lebanon 200,000 70,000 Libya 93,600 59,400 53,600 Mali 227,900 254,800 Montenegro 16,200 16,200 Myanmar 58,500 67,300 67,300 62,000 239,200 339,200 430,400 372,000 Nepal 100,000 50,000 Nigeria 360,000 Pakistan 155,800 155,800 1,894,600 952,000 452,900 758,000 747,500 Philippines 139,500 159,500 1,200 117,400 Russia 158,900 263,700 91,500 79,900 75,400 Serbia 227,600 226,400 225,900 224,900 228,400 228,200 227,800 227,500 Somalia 400,000 1,000,000 1,277,200 1,392,300 1,463,800 1,356,800 1,133,000 1,133,000 South Sudan 223,700 209,700 345,700 331,100 Sri Lanka 469,000 459,600 504,800 434,900 273,800 138,400 93,500 42,200 Sudan 1,325,200 1,225,000 1,201,000 1,079,100 1,602,200 2,033,100 1,873,300 1,873,300 Syria 2,016,500 6,520,800 East Timor 155,200 62,600 15,900 Uganda 1,814,900 1,236,000 853,000 428,600 125,600 Yemen 77,000 100,000 250,000 193,700 347,300 385,300 306,600 Zimbabwe 54,300 57,900 60,100 Country/territory 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Official opening of MONUSCO's photo exhibition organized in the framework of the 70th anniversary of the United Nations.

Serbian and other non-Albanian refugees during Kosovo War. Serbia is home to highest number of refugees and IDPs in Europe.[24][25][26] Notable IDP camps[edit] There are many IDP camps in Nigeria and especially many IDP camps in Borno State. Until recently there were many IDP camps in Sri Lanka. Protection and assistance[edit] The problem of protecting and assisting IDPs is not a new issue. In international law it is the responsibility of the government concerned to provide assistance and protection for the IDPs in their country. However, as many of the displaced are a result of civil conflict and violence or where the authority of the central state is in doubt, there is no local authority willing to provide assistance and protection.[27] It has been estimated that some 5 million IDPs in 11 countries are "without any significant humanitarian assistance from their governments."[20] Under these circumstances rehabilitation policies on humanitarian grounds should be aimed at reducing inequality of opportunity among these vulnerable groups by integrating them into local social services and allowing them access to jobs, education, and healthcare opportunities; otherwise new conflicts might break out.[28] Unlike the case of refugees, there is no international humanitarian institution which has the overall responsibility of protecting and assisting the refugees as well as the internally displaced. A number of organizations have stepped into the breach in specific circumstances.
