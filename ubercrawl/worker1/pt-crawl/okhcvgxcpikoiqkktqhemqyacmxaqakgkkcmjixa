January 30 Hamas restates its commitment to the truce between it and Fatah despite continued factional violence. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by Tewfik (talk • contribs) 17:58, 30 January 2007. They have been fighting for ages. Is there anything special this time that is worth noting on ITN ? --PFHLai 00:52, 2 February 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] January 29 At least 200 people were killed during a battle between US-backed Iraqi troops and militants in Najaf ahead of a major Shia Muslim festival. --TheFEARgod (Ч) 16:22, 29 January 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Added, but worded differently. -- tariqabjotu 03:14, 31 January 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] 2006 Kentucky Derby-winning Thoroughbred race horse Barbaro is euthanized, ending an eight-month-long battle with injuries sustained in the Preakness Stakes. --Kitch (Talk : Contrib) 22:32, 29 January 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Going through the criteria for putting a death on In the News (has to meet one of the following three): (a) the deceased was in a high ranking office of power at the time of death Does winner of the Kentucky Derby count? (b) the deceased was a key figure in their field of expertise, and died unexpectedly or tragically The former part is debatable, but the latter is certainly not the case (c) the death has a major international impact that affects current events Not really. Sorry, but the criteria are really biased toward humans; it's real tough to get an animal in ITN. -- tariqabjotu 22:44, 29 January 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I personally think there can be an exception in this case, as Barbaro is an extremely exceptional case that could shift the paradigm in horse racing. Before they tried to save Barbaro, horses that broke down on the track were typically put out of their misery on the track. The attention given to his case, and the outpouring of support for the cause, may be enough to pass muster on notability. Besides, the current ITN right now is rather stale. Something new needs to be up there. --Kitch (Talk : Contrib) 23:20, 29 January 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I'm with tariqabjotu on this one. It fails on (a), (b) and (c). Thumbs-down. The Tom 02:47, 30 January 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Milton Friedman was snubbed, then a horse gets in? Isn't that a bit bizarre? --Howard the Duck 07:05, 30 January 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] The launch of Microsoft Windows Vista commences. --Kitch (Talk : Contrib) 23:20, 29 January 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] This will only be notable if something unusual happens after it is released. Right now it's just another version of the existing paradigm of operating systems. There's no fundamental shift or notable feature of the new version. --Monotonehell 01:51, 30 January 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I think Microsoft gets more than enough publicity without us helping along. I agree with Monotonehell, a consumer product meriting ITN consideration would have to be both groundbreaking, and affect a great number of people; neither of which Vista appears to be.

(BBC) — Preceding unsigned comment added by Tewfik (talk • contribs) 17:45, 30 January 2007 Please have a look at the criteria before posting. We need an updated Wikipedia article not a link to the BBC. --Monotonehell 05:43, 1 February 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] January 28 Roger Federer and Serena Williams win the 2007 Australian Open, claiming their 10th and 8th Grand Slam singles titles, respectively. --16:00, 29 January 2007 (UTC) I'd pondered adding this myself (we're in a bit of a slow spell, it seems), but I think there're notability issues. Its the first of four majors held every single year, and arguably the least prestigious of the four. If people didn't flog "past precedence" all the time, especially in discussion over sporting entries, I might be inclined to give it a one-shot thumbs up, but we all know how likely that is :). The Tom 16:22, 29 January 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Roger Federer won without losing a set, the first to do that at a Grand Slam since 1980. And Serena Williams was unseeded. The former at least is notable enough. --Kitch (Talk : Contrib) 23:22, 29 January 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] IMHO, all 4 grand slams should be posted on the main page. --Howard the Duck 11:10, 30 January 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Posted.

Blood Red Sandman Open Up Your Heart - Receive My EviLove 19:55, 26 January 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Anyone actually chacking this? This is Blood Red Sandman, attempting to contact any intelligent life-forms that may exist at ITN/C.... Hello.... Blood Red Sandman Open Up Your Heart - Receive My EviLove 14:03, 28 January 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Posted the discovery of the black boxes. I left out the dispute about the cost of retrieval as the line is already quite long and this may be outdated info soon. I don't know when the next admin will show up here. --PFHLai 14:50, 29 January 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Good call. Indonesia has given up trying to get Adam Air to fund recovery, opting instead to request assistance from France, Japan and the US. Blood Red Sandman Open Up Your Heart - Receive My EviLove 18:04, 29 January 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] January 25 Investigations into Corruption scandals in Chile lead to four deputies being accused of using government money to fund their electoral campaigns (perhaps that's not the best way of wording it, but the article is fully sourced and in my opinion deserves to be mentioned somehow). Marmaduque 23:50, 25 January 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] May be better to wait till some big name politicians lose their jobs. --PFHLai 16:58, 26 January 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] The final results of the Serbian 2007 parliamentary election show that the Serbian Radicals will be the largest party in the parliament, but most of the votes went to the Democrat Bloc (rephrasing optional). --PaxEquilibrium 21:47, 25 January 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Already posted (not by me). --PFHLai 16:58, 26 January 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] President of Israel Moshe Katsav temporarily stands down amid allegations of sexual assault.

(needs work - but time on the main page may help build the article). --Peta 01:44, 25 January 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] The article seems too stubby now. May be better to feature this on MainPage when it has grown a little more. It should grow while it sits at Portal: Current events. --PFHLai 16:58, 26 January 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Perhaps whoever is working on this topic should focus on the Lansana Conté article, which at least has the near-term potential for high quality development.--Pharos 00:32, 27 January 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] January 24 Several editors have expressed interest in listing the 2007 State of the Union Address. A hook such as the one presently on the current events portal could deem it worthy. —bbatsell ¿? 04:36, 24 January 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Considering the heat that Nancy Pelosi received from her last ITN inclusion I don't think that this is notoriety enough to include. State of the union addresses are only notable if something unusual is stated in them. --Monotonehell 06:15, 24 January 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I agree. We don't for example mention opening speeches from PMs and other leaders when parliament opens every year. The Nancy Pelosi case was perhaps borderline for inclusion as it was noteable due to the fact she was the first female. But although this speech was on the BBC World and I fact watched it, I don't think it meets the threshold for international interest. If Bush has opened the speech with something like "well basically, the union is fucked" then yes, it would be worth including but the most noteable thing that seemed to come out of it, was that Bush mentioned Nancy Pelosi extensively at the beginning in an apparent conciliatory move but then used Democrat as an abjective which is apparently a no-no (he was supposed to say Democratic). Also the fact that most commentators didn't think he'd sold his Iraq plan much better then before. (Oh I also personally found it bizarre how he wanted to save the Medicare and stuff but then talked extensively about private insurance but anyway no one else seem to take issue that I noticed.) 203.109.240.93 14:57, 24 January 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Seriously, ignoring for the moment the biased language of the entry itself, is this even news? ~ trialsanderrors 22:34, 24 January 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] The address was the first to occur with a Democratic Congress and female Speaker. President Bush talked about foreign policy in the Middle Ease (mainly Iraq) and in Asia (mainly Korea), which could be in the interest of other countries in the world!--Ed ¿Cómo estás?Reviews? 00:30, 25 January 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] But as per above, since there was nothing new about Iraq or North Korea, there's nothing noteable about it. And I don't think fist female is relevant. Are we going to have the first budget, first removal from house (does that happen in the US?) etc under first female speaker? We've already mentioned her when she was swore in which is sufficient IMHO. And I'm pretty sure there has been a Democractic Congress before, contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 79 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Wikipedia:In_the_news/Candidates/January_2007 responseCode 3 200
