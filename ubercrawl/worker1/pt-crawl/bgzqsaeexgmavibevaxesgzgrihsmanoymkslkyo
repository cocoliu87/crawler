Further template category notes This category contains pages in the template namespace. It should not be used to categorize articles or pages in other namespaces. To add a template to this category: If the template has a separate documentation page (usually called "Template:template name/doc"), add [[Category:Wikipedia multilingual support templates]] to the <includeonly> section at the bottom of that page. Otherwise, add <noinclude>[[Category:Wikipedia multilingual support templates]]</noinclude> to the end of the template code, making sure it starts on the same line as the code's last character. While the documentation for many of these templates remains variable, it may be useful to refer to the relevant page in Category:Wikipedia Manual of Style (regional).
