The ICC Men's Test Team Rankings (formerly known as the ICC Test Championship) is an international rankings system of the International Cricket Council for the 12 teams that play Test cricket. The rankings are based on international matches that are otherwise played as part of regular Test cricket scheduling, with no consideration of home or away status. After every Test series, the two teams involved receive points based on a mathematical formula involving both teams' previous rating and the result of the series. Each team's points total from matches over the last 3–4 years is divided by a figure based on their total number of matches and series played, to give a "rating". A drawn match between higher and lower rated teams will benefit the lower-rated team at the expense of the higher-rated team. An "average" team that wins as often as it loses, while playing a mix of stronger and weaker teams, will have a rating of 100. The top ranked Test team was previously awarded the ICC Test Championship mace, until the inauguration of ICC World Test Championship. From 2002 to 2019, the mace was transferred whenever a new team moved to the top of the rating list.[1] The team that was top of the ratings table on 1 April each year also won a cash prize.[2] India is currently the highest-ranked team in the rankings, as of an update published in May 2023.[3] Current rankings[edit] ICC Men's Test Team Rankings v t e Rank Team Matches Points Rating 1 India 29 3,434 118 2 Australia 30 3,534 118 3 England 43 4,941 115 4 South Africa 21 2,182 104 5 New Zealand 23 2,291 100 6 Pakistan 25 2,304 92 7 Sri Lanka 27 2,123 79 8 West Indies 28 2,154 77 9 Bangladesh 19 873 46 10 Zimbabwe 7 223 32 Reference: ICC Test Rankings, 31 July 2023 "Matches" is no. matches + no. series played in the 12–24 months since the May before last, plus half the number in the 24 months before that. Historical rankings[edit] The ICC provides ratings for the end of each month back to June 2003.

However, from 2009, several teams (Australia, South Africa, India, England, New Zealand, and Pakistan) have competed for the top positions. The ICC retrospectively applied the current rating system to results since 1952 (providing ratings for the end of each month from then). The table only begins then, as prior to 1952 there is insufficient data available due to the infrequency of matches and the small number of competing teams in these earlier periods.[4] The teams that have successively held the highest rating from January 1952 until May 2003, by whole month periods are: Team Start End Total months Cumulative months Australia January 1952 May 1955 41 41 England June 1955 February 1958 33 33 Australia March 1958 July 1958 5 46 England August 1958 December 1958 5 38 Australia January 1959 December 1963 60 106 West Indies January 1964 December 1968 60 60 South Africa January 1969 December 1969 12 12 England January 1970 January 1973 37 75 Australia February 1973 March 1973 2 108 India April 1973 June 1974 15 15 Australia July 1974 January 1978 43 151 West Indies February 1978 January 1979 12 72 England February 1979 August 1980 19 94 India September 1980 February 1981 6 21 West Indies March 1981 July 1988 89 161 Pakistan August 1988 September 1988 2 2 West Indies October 1988 January 1991 28 189 Australia February 1991 April 1991 3 154 West Indies May 1991 July 1992 15 204 Australia August 1992 January 1993 6 160 West Indies February 1993 August 1995 31 235 India September 1995 November 1995 3 24 Australia December 1995 July 1999 44 204 South Africa August 1999 December 1999 5 17 Australia January 2000 February 2000 2 206 South Africa March 2000 March 2000 1 18 Australia April 2000 July 2001 16 222 South Africa August 2001 August 2001 1 19 Australia September 2001 May 2003 21 243 Reference: ICC Historical Rankings The summary of teams that have held the highest rating from 1952 to the present by whole month periods are: Team Total months Highest rating Australia 350 143 West Indies 235 135 England 106 125 India 94 130 South Africa 61 135 New Zealand 8 126 Pakistan 4 111 Reference: ICC Historical Rankings ICC Test championship (2002–2019)[edit] The rankings system was called ICC Test Championship, until the inauguration of ICC World Test Championship in 2019. From 2002 to 2019, the top-ranked Test team was awarded with the ICC Test Championship mace and the top team at each April 1 cut-off (until 2019) was also awarded a cash prize, the winners of which are listed below.[5][6] The mace is now awarded to the winners of the ICC World Test Championship.[7] Team Awarded Australia April 2002–09 India April 2010–11 England April 2012 South Africa April 2013–15 Australia April 2016 India April 2017–19 Reference: ICC[8][9] Calculations[edit] Qualifying matches[edit] Matches that qualify are those played as part of a series consisting of at least two Tests. Time period[edit] Each team scores points based on the results of their matches over the last 3−4 years − the matches played in the 12–24 months since the May before last, plus the matches played in the 24 months before that, for which the matches played and points earned both count half. For example: May 2010 May 2011 May 2012 May 2013 May 2014 May 2015 Between May 2013 and April 2014: Results that were achieved during this period have 50% weighting Results that were achieved during this period have 100% weighting Between May 2014 and April 2015: Results that were achieved during this period have 50% weighting Results that were achieved during this period have 100% weighting Each May, the matches and points earned between 3 and 4 years ago are removed, and the matches and points earned between 1 and 2 years ago switch from 100% weighting to 50% weighting. For example, on 1 May 2014, the matches played between May 2010 and April 2011 were removed, and the matches played between May 2012 and April 2013 switched to 50% weighting (the matches from May 2011 to April 2012 would have already been at 50% following the previous rerating). This happens overnight, so can result in teams changing positions in the ranking table despite no one playing. Find the points earned from a series[edit] Each time two teams complete another series, the rankings tables is updated as described below, based on the ratings of the teams immediately before they played.[10][11] Step 1. Find the series points for each team[edit] Award 1 point to a team for each match won. Award 1/2 point to a team for each match drawn or tied. Award 1 bonus point to the team winning the series. Award 1/2 bonus point to each team if the series is drawn. Step 2. Convert these series points to actual ratings points[edit] If the gap between the ratings of the two teams before the series was less than 40 points The ratings points for each team equals: (The team's own series points) x (The opponent's rating + 50) + {\displaystyle +} (The opponent's series points) x (The opponent's rating − 50) As each match won earns a team 1 series point and their opponent 0, losing earns them 0 series points and their opponent 1, and drawing earns both teams 1/2 series point, each match played therefore earns teams ratings points as follows: Single match result Ratings points earned Win Opponent's rating + 100 Draw or tie Opponent's rating Lose Opponent's rating − 100 As this formula only applies when the gap between the ratings of the two teams at the start of the series was less than 40 points, winning a match will always earn a team more rating points than the rating they already had, and losing a match will always earn a team fewer rating points than the rating they already had. Drawing a match will earn the weaker team more rating points than the rating they already had, and the stronger team fewer. The difference between winning and losing a single match is therefore 100 points. Also, whether the outcome of a match is a win & lose or a draw, the total rating points earned by the two teams from that match will be the sum of the two teams' ratings before the series began. The total rating points earned from a series will therefore equal the sum of the two teams' ratings before the series began multiplied by (the number of ma contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 64 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/ICC_Men%27s_Test_Team_Rankings responseCode 3 200
