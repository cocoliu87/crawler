Daylight saving time regions: Northern Hemisphere summer Southern Hemisphere summer Formerly used daylight saving Never used daylight saving Daylight saving time (DST), also referred to as daylight savings time, daylight time (United States, Canada, and Australia), or summer time (United Kingdom, European Union, and others), is the practice of advancing clocks (typically by one hour) during warmer months so that darkness falls at a later clock time.[1][2] The typical implementation of DST is to set clocks forward by one hour in either the late winter or spring ("spring forward"), and to set clocks back by one hour in the fall (North American English) ("fall back") or autumn (UK English) to return to standard time. As a result, there is one 23-hour day in early spring and one 25-hour day in the middle of autumn. The idea of aligning waking hours to daylight hours to conserve candles was first conceptualized in 1784 by American polymath Benjamin Franklin. In a satirical letter to the editor of The Journal of Paris, Franklin suggested that waking up earlier in the summer would economize on candle usage and calculated considerable savings.[3][4] In 1895, New Zealand entomologist and astronomer George Hudson proposed the idea of changing clocks by two hours every spring to the Wellington Philosophical Society.[5] In 1907, British resident William Willett presented the idea as a way to save energy. After some serious consideration, it was not implemented.[6] In 1908, Port Arthur in Ontario, Canada (today merged into Thunder Bay), started using DST.[7][8] Starting on 30 April 1916, the German Empire and Austria-Hungary each organized the first nationwide implementation in their jurisdictions. Many countries have used DST at various times since then, particularly since the 1970s energy crisis. DST is generally not observed near the Equator, where sunrise and sunset times do not vary enough to justify it. Some countries observe it only in some regions: for example, parts of Australia observe it, while other parts do not; conversely, it is not observed at some places at high latitudes because there are wide variations in sunrise and sunset times and a one-hour shift would relatively not make much difference at all. The United States observes it, except for the states of Hawaii and Arizona (within the latter, however, the Navajo Nation observes it, conforming to federal practice).[9] A minority of the world's population uses DST—Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean generally do not. Rationale[edit] An ancient water clock that lets hour lengths vary with season Industrialized societies usually follow a clock-based schedule for daily activities that do not change throughout the course of the year. The time of day that individuals begin and end work or school, and the coordination of mass transit, for example, usually remain constant year-round. In contrast, an agrarian society's daily routines for work and personal conduct are more likely governed by the length of daylight hours[10][11] and by solar time, which change seasonally because of the Earth's axial tilt. North and south of the tropics, daylight lasts longer in summer and shorter in winter, with the effect becoming greater the farther one moves away from the equator. After synchronously resetting all clocks in a region to one hour ahead of standard time in spring in anticipation of longer daylight hours, individuals following a clock-based schedule will be awakened an hour earlier in the solar day than they would have otherwise. They will begin and complete daily work routines an hour earlier: in most cases they will have an extra hour of daylight available to them after their workday activities.[12][13] Proponents of daylight saving time argue that most people prefer a greater increase in daylight hours after the typical "nine to five" workday.[14][15] Supporters have also argued that DST decreases energy consumption by reducing the need for lighting and heating, but the actual effect on overall energy use is heavily disputed.[citation needed] The shift in apparent time is also motivated by practicality. In American temperate latitudes, for example, the sun rises around 04:30 at the summer solstice and sets around 19:30. Since most people are asleep at 04:30, it is seen as more practical to treat 04:30 as if it is 05:30, thereby allowing people to wake closer to the sunrise and be active in the evening light. DST is of little use for locations near the Equator, because these regions see only a small variation in daylight in the course of the year. Variation within a time zone[edit] The effect of daylight saving time also varies according to how far east or west the location is within its time zone, with locations farther east inside the time zone benefiting more from DST than locations farther west in the same time zone.[16] In spite of a width spanning thousands of kilometers, all of China is located within a single time zone per government mandate, minimizing any potential benefit of daylight saving time there. History[edit] Ancient civilizations adjusted daily schedules to the sun more flexibly than DST does, often dividing daylight into 12 hours regardless of daytime, so that each daylight hour became progressively longer during spring and shorter during autumn.[17] For example, the Romans kept time with water clocks that had different scales for different months of the year; at Rome's latitude, the third hour from sunrise (hora tertia) started at 09:02 solar time and lasted 44 minutes at the winter solstice, but at the summer solstice it started at 06:58 and lasted 75 minutes.[18] From the 14th century onward, equal-length civil hours supplanted unequal ones, so civil time no longer varied by season. Unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings, such as monasteries of Mount Athos[19] and in Jewish ceremonies.[20] Benjamin Franklin published the proverb "early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise",[21][22] and published a letter in the Journal de Paris during his time as an American envoy to France (1776–1785) suggesting that Parisians economize on candles by rising earlier to use morning sunlight.[23] This 1784 satire proposed taxing window shutters, rationing candles, and waking the public by ringing church bells and firing cannons at sunrise.[24] Despite common misconception, Franklin did not actually propose DST; 18th-century Europe did not even keep precise schedules. However, this changed as rail transport and communication networks required a standardization of time unknown in Franklin's day.[25] In 1810, the Spanish National Assembly Cortes of Cádiz issued a regulation that moved certain meeting times forward by one hour from 1 May to 30 September in recognition of seasonal changes, but it did not change the clocks. It also acknowledged that private businesses were in the practice of changing their opening hours to suit daylight conditions, but they did so of their volition.[26][27] George Hudson was the first to propose modern DST, in 1895. New Zealand entomologist George Hudson first proposed modern DST. His shift-work job gave him spare time to collect insects and led him to value after-hours daylight.[5] In 1895, he presented a paper to the Wellington Philosophical Society proposing a two-hour daylight-saving shift,[12] and considerable interest was expressed in Christchurch; he followed up with an 1898 paper.[28] Many publications credit the DST proposal to prominent English builder and outdoorsman William Willett,[29] who independently conceived DST in 1905 during a pre-breakfast ride when he observed how many Londoners slept through a large part of a summer day.[15] Willett also was an avid golfer who disliked cutting short his round at dusk.[30] His solution was to advance the clock during the summer, and he published the proposal two years later.[31] Liberal Party member of parliament Robert Pearce took up the proposal, introducing the first Daylight Saving Bill to the British House of Commons on 12 February 1908.[32] A select committee was set up to examine the issue, but Pearce's bill did not become law and several other bills failed in the following years.[6] Willett lobbied for the proposal in the UK until his death in 1915. DST was first implemented in the United States to conserve energy during World War I (poster by United Cigar Stores). Port Arthur, Ontario, Canada, was the first city in the world to enact DST, on 1 July 1908.[7][8] This was followed by Orillia, Ontario, introduced by William Sword Frost while mayor from 1911 to 1912.[33] The first states to adopt DST (German: Sommerzeit) nationally were those of the German Empire and its World War I ally Austria-Hungary commencing on 30 April 1916, as a way to conserve coal during wartime. Britain, most of its allies, and many European neutrals soon followed. Russia and a few other countries waited until the next year, and the United States adopted daylight saving in 1918. Most jurisdictions abandoned DST in the years after the war ended in 1918, with exceptions including Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, and the United States.[34] It became common during World War II (some countries adopted double summer time), and was standardized in the US by federal law in 1966, and widely adopted in Europe from the 1970s as a result of the 1970s energy crisis. Since then, the world has seen many enactments, adjustments, and repeals.[35] It is a common myth in the United States that DST was first implemented for the benefit of farmers.[36][37][38] In reality, farmers have been one of the strongest lobbying groups against DST since it was first implemented.[36][37][38] The factors that influence farming schedules, such as morning dew and dairy cattle's readiness to be milked, are ultimately dictated by the sun, so the time change introdu contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 54 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Daylight_saving_time responseCode 3 200
