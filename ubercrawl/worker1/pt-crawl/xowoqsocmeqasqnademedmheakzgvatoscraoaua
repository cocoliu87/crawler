xowoqsocmeqasqnademedmheakzgvatoscraoaua page 1689 Standard sea-level conditions (SSL),[1] also known as sea-level standard (SLS), defines a set of atmospheric conditions for physical calculations. The term "standard sea level" is used to indicate that values of properties are to be taken to be the same as those standard at sea level, and is done to define values for use in general calculations. Atmospheric properties[edit] At SSL some atmospheric properties are:[2] Pressure, P = 101.325 kPa ⇔ 2116.2 lbf/ft2 ⇔ 14.696 lbf/in2 ⇔ 760 mmHg ⇔ 29.92 inHg Density, ρ {\displaystyle \rho } = 1.225 kg/m3 ⇔ 0.002377 slug/ft3 Temperature, T = 15 °C ⇔ 59 °F ⇔ 288.15 K ⇔ 518.67 °R Gas constant of air, Rair = 287.057 J/(kg·K) ⇔ 1716.59 ft·lb/sl·°R) Specific Weight, γ {\displaystyle \gamma } = 12.014 N/m3 ⇔ 0.07647 lbf/ft3 Dynamic viscosity, μ {\displaystyle \mu } = 1.789×10−5 Pa·s ⇔ 3.737×10−7 slug/(s·ft) Acceleration of gravity, g0 = 9.807 m/s2 ⇔ 32.174 ft/s2 [3] See also[edit] Sea level Sea level rise Standard temperature and pressure U.S. Standard Atmosphere References[edit] ^ Stephen Corda, Introduction to Aerospace Engineering with a Flight Test Perspective, John Wiley & Sons, 2017.
