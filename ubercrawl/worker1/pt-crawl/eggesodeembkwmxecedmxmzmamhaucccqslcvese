A deity or god is a supernatural being considered to be sacred and worthy of worship. The Oxford Dictionary of English defines deity as a god or goddess, or anything revered as divine.[1] C. Scott Littleton defines a deity as "a being with powers greater than those of ordinary humans, but who interacts with humans, positively or negatively, in ways that carry humans to new levels of consciousness, beyond the grounded preoccupations of ordinary life".[2] Religions can be categorized by how many deities they worship. Monotheistic religions accept only one deity (predominantly referred to as "God"),[3][4] whereas polytheistic religions accept multiple deities.[5] Henotheistic religions accept one supreme deity without denying other deities, considering them as aspects of the same divine principle.[6][7] Nontheistic religions deny any supreme eternal creator deity, but may accept a pantheon of deities which live, die and may be reborn like any other being.[8]: 35–37 [9]: 357–358  Although most monotheistic religions traditionally envision their god as omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient, omnibenevolent, and eternal,[10][11] none of these qualities are essential to the definition of a "deity"[12][13][14] and various cultures have conceptualized their deities differently.[12][13] Monotheistic religions typically refer to their god in masculine terms,[15][16]: 96  while other religions refer to their deities in a variety of ways—male, female, hermaphroditic, or genderless.[17][18][19] Many cultures—including the ancient Mesopotamians, Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and Germanic peoples—have personified natural phenomena, variously as either deliberate causes or effects.[20][21][22] Some Avestan and Vedic deities were viewed as ethical concepts.[20][21] In Indian religions, deities have been envisioned as manifesting within the temple of every living being's body, as sensory organs and mind.[23][24][25] Deities are envisioned as a form of existence (Saṃsāra) after rebirth, for human beings who gain merit through an ethical life, where they become guardian deities and live blissfully in heaven, but are also subject to death when their merit is lost.[8]: 35–38 [9]: 356–359  Etymology[edit] Main articles: Dyeus, Deus, God (word), and Deva (Hinduism) The English language word deity derives from Old French deité,[26][page needed] the Latin deitatem or "divine nature", coined by Augustine of Hippo from deus ("god"). Deus is related through a common Proto-Indo-European (PIE) origin to *deiwos.[27] This root yields the ancient Indian word Deva meaning "to gleam, a shining one", from *div- "to shine", as well as Greek dios "divine" and Zeus; and Latin deus "god" (Old Latin deivos).[28][29][30]: 230–31  Deva is masculine, and the related feminine equivalent is devi.[31]: 496  Etymologically, the cognates of Devi are Latin dea and Greek thea.[32] In Old Persian, daiva- means "demon, evil god",[29] while in Sanskrit it means the opposite, referring to the "heavenly, divine, terrestrial things of high excellence, exalted, shining ones".[31]: 496 [33][34] The closely linked term "god" refers to "supreme being, deity", according to Douglas Harper,[35] and is derived from Proto-Germanic *guthan, from PIE *ghut-, which means "that which is invoked".[30]: 230–231  Guth in the Irish language means "voice". The term *ghut- is also the source of Old Church Slavonic zovo ("to call"), Sanskrit huta- ("invoked", an epithet of Indra), from the root *gheu(e)- ("to call, invoke."),[35] An alternate etymology for the term "god" comes from the Proto-Germanic Gaut, which traces it to the PIE root *ghu-to- ("poured"), derived from the root *gheu- ("to pour, pour a libation"). The term *gheu- is also the source of the Greek khein "to pour".[35] Originally the word "god" and its other Germanic cognates were neuter nouns but shifted to being generally masculine under the influence of Christianity in which the god is typically seen as male.[30]: 230–231 [35] In contrast, all ancient Indo-European cultures and mythologies recognized both masculine and feminine deities.[34] Definitions[edit] Pantheists believe that the universe itself and everything in it forms a single, all-encompassing deity.[36][37] There is no universally accepted consensus on what a deity is, and concepts of deities vary considerably across cultures.[16]: 69–74 [38] Huw Owen states that the term "deity or god or its equivalent in other languages" has a bewildering range of meanings and significance.[39]: vii–ix  It has ranged from "infinite transcendent being who created and lords over the universe" (God), to a "finite entity or experience, with special significance or which evokes a special feeling" (god), to "a concept in religious or philosophical context that relates to nature or magnified beings or a supra-mundane realm", to "numerous other usages".[39]: vii–ix  A deity is typically conceptualized as a supernatural or divine concept, manifesting in ideas and knowledge, in a form that combines excellence in some or all aspects, wrestling with weakness and questions in other aspects, heroic in outlook and actions, yet tied up with emotions and desires.[40][41] In other cases, the deity is a principle or reality such as the idea of "soul". The Upanishads of Hinduism, for example, characterize Atman (soul, self) as deva (deity), thereby asserting that the deva and eternal supreme principle (Brahman) is part of every living creature, that this soul is spiritual and divine, and that to realize self-knowledge is to know the supreme.[42][43][44] Theism is the belief in the existence of one or more deities.[45][46] Polytheism is the belief in and worship of multiple deities,[47] which are usually assembled into a pantheon of gods and goddesses, with accompanying rituals.[47] In most polytheistic religions, the different gods and goddesses are representations of forces of nature or ancestral principles, and can be viewed either as autonomous or as aspects or emanations of a creator God or transcendental absolute principle (monistic theologies), which manifests immanently in nature.[47] Henotheism accepts the existence of more than one deity, but considers all deities as equivalent representations or aspects of the same divine principle, the highest.[7][48][6][49] Monolatry is the belief that many deities exist, but that only one of these deities may be validly worshipped.[50][51] Monotheism is the belief that only one deity exists.[52][53][54][55][56][57][58][excessive citations] A monotheistic deity, known as "God", is usually described as omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient, omnibenevolent and eternal.[59] However, not all deities have been regarded this way[12][14][60][61] and an entity does not need to be almighty, omnipresent, omniscient, omnibenevolent or eternal to qualify as a deity.[12][14][60] Deism is the belief that only one deity exists, who created the universe, but does not usually intervene in the resulting world.[62][63][64][page needed] Deism was particularly popular among western intellectuals during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.[65][66] Pantheism is the belief that the universe itself is God[36] or that everything composes an all-encompassing, immanent deity.[37] Pandeism is an intermediate position between these, proposing that the creator became a pantheistic universe.[67] Panentheism is the belief that divinity pervades the universe, but that it also transcends the universe.[68] Agnosticism is the position that it is impossible to know for certain whether a deity of any kind exists.[69][70][71] Atheism is the non-belief in the existence of any deity.[72] Prehistoric[edit] Statuette of a nude, corpulent, seated woman flanked by two felines from Çatalhöyük, dating to c. 6000 BCE, thought by most archaeologists to represent a goddess of some kind[73][74] Further information: Prehistoric religion Scholars infer the probable existence of deities in the prehistoric period from inscriptions and prehistoric arts such as cave drawings, but it is unclear what these sketches and paintings are and why they were made.[75] Some engravings or sketches show animals, hunters or rituals.[76] It was once common for archaeologists to interpret virtually every prehistoric female figurine as a representation of a single, primordial goddess, the ancestor of historically attested goddesses such as Inanna, Ishtar, Astarte, Cybele, and Aphrodite;[77] this approach has now generally been discredited.[77] Modern archaeologists now generally recognize that it is impossible to conclusively identify any prehistoric figurines as representations of any kind of deities, let alone goddesses.[77] Nonetheless, it is possible to evaluate ancient representations on a case-by-case basis and rate them on how likely they are to represent deities.[77] The Venus of Willendorf, a female figurine found in Europe and dated to about 25,000 BCE has been interpreted by some as an exemplar of a prehistoric female deity.[76] A number of probable representations of deities have been discovered at 'Ain Ghazal[77] and the works of art uncovered at Çatalhöyük reveal references to what is probably a complex mythology.[77] Religions and cultures[edit] Sub-Saharan African[edit] Main articles: List of African mythological figures, Traditional African religion, Afro-American religion, and Orisha Yoruba deity from Nigeria Diverse African cultures developed theology and concepts of deities over their history.
