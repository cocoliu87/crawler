Hamas meticulously planned for a massacre of Israeli civilians with the goal of provoking Israel to invade Gaza.[20] The attacks initiated the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, almost exactly fifty years after the Yom Kippur War began on 6 October 1973. Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups named the attacks Operation Al-Aqsa Flood (or Deluge; Arabic: عملية طوفان الأقصى, romanized: ʿamaliyyat ṭūfān al-ʾAqṣā),[1] while they are referred to in Israel as Black Saturday (Hebrew: השבת השחורה),[21] or the Simchat Torah Massacre (הטבח בשמחת תורה),[22] and internationally as the 7 October attack.[23][24][25] The attacks began in the early morning with a rocket barrage of at least 3,000 rockets launched against Israel and vehicle-transported and powered paraglider incursions into its territory.[26][27] Hamas fighters breached the Gaza–Israel barrier, killing civilians in neighboring Israeli communities and attacking Israeli military bases. In a single day, 859 Israeli civilians[15] and at least 345 Israeli soldiers and policemen[16][17][8] were killed in nearby towns, kibbutzim, military bases and at a music festival near Re'im.[28][13][14][8] Around 200 Israeli civilians and soldiers were taken as hostages to the Gaza Strip, of which the number of kidnapped children is about 30.[29][30][31] At least 44 nations denounced the attack as terrorism, while Arab and Muslim countries including Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Syria, Iran and Iraq have blamed Israel for the attack.[32][33][34] The day is considered the bloodiest in Israel's history and the deadliest for Jews since The Holocaust.[35][36][37][38] Background Main article: Israeli-Palestinian conflict Israel has occupied the Palestinian territories, including the Gaza Strip, since the Six Day War in 1967.[d][41][42] According to some sources, Hamas's objective is the establishment of a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders.[43] Hamas had repeatedly called for the destruction of the state of Israel, to be replaced with an Islamic state, and its 1988 founding charter mandated the killing of Jews.[44][45][46] Hamas replaced it with a new document in 2017 that removed antisemitic language and said Hamas's struggle was with Zionists not Jews.[47][48][49][50] Prior to the attack, Saudi Arabia warned Israel of an "explosion" as a result of the continued occupation,[51] Egypt had warned of a catastrophe unless there was political progress,[52] and similar warnings were given by Palestinian Authority officials.[52] Less than two months before the attacks, King Abdullah II of Jordan lamented that Palestinians have "no civil rights; no freedom of mobility".[52] Since 2006, the Gaza Strip has been described as an "open-air prison",[53] due to the ongoing blockade by Israel. Israel and Hamas have fought several wars since then, including in 2009, 2014 and 2021. Events leading to the attack See also: May 2023 Gaza–Israel clashes and July 2023 Jenin incursion Over the course of 2023, before the attack, 247 Palestinians had been killed by Israeli forces, while 39 Israelis were killed by Palestinians.[54] Increases in settler attacks had displaced hundreds of Palestinians, and there were clashes around the Al-Aqsa Mosque, a contested holy site in Jerusalem.[55] Tensions between Israel and Hamas rose in September 2023, and the Washington Post described the two "on the brink of war".[56] On 13 September, five Palestinians were killed at the border.[e] Israel stated that it found explosives hidden in a shipment and halted all exports from Gaza;[56] Hamas denied this.[58] Reuters quoted Palestinians who said that the several day ban impacted thousands of families.[58] In response to the ban, Hamas put its forces on high alert, and conducted military exercises with other groups, including openly practicing storming Israeli settlements.[56] Hamas also allowed Palestinians to resume protests at the Israel-Gaza barrier.[56] On 29 September, Qatar, the UN, and Egypt mediated an agreement between Israel and Hamas officials in the Gaza Strip to reopen closed crossing points and deescalate tensions;[59] the total number of Gazans with work permits in Israel stood at 17,000.[60] Egypt said it warned Israel days before the attack, "an explosion of the situation is coming, and very soon, and it would be big."[61] Israel denied receiving such a warning,[62] though Michael McCaul, Chairman of the US House Foreign Relations Committee, said warnings were made three days before the attack.[63] Hamas preparations Bedouin clans built early smuggling tunnels on the Egypt-Gaza border in 1981. In 2001, Hamas began a vast underground network initially for smuggling, later serving multiple functions. The tunnels aimed to shift battles underground. In 2014, Hamas employed 900 for tunnel construction, each taking three months and costing an average of $100,000. Funding came from commercial schemes via Gaza's mosques, with contributions from Iran and North Korea.[64] Gaza's tunnel network, known euphemistically as the "Gaza metro", serves Hamas for storage, movement, and command. Hamas used hardwired phone lines within the tunnels for covert communication over two years, evading Israeli intelligence. This allowed a successful surprise attack on Israel, with specific plans disclosed shortly before the operation, catching intelligence agencies off guard.[65] In the months preceding the attack, Hamas had publicly released videos of its militants had preparing to attack Israel. A video released in December 2022 showed Hamas training to take hostages, while another video showed Hamas practicing paragliding.[66] On 12 September, Hamas posted a video of its fighters training to blast through the border.[67] The IDF would later state, after the attack, that Hamas had extensively studied the military bases and settlements near the border.[68][69] The Wall Street Journal has accused Iran of being behind the attack, while this has been denied by US officials,[70] as well as Iran.[71] Timeline For a more comprehensive list, see List of engagements during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war.

Aftermath of a rocket attack in Rishon LeZion At around 6:30 a.m. Israel Summer Time (UTC+3) on Saturday 7 October 2023,[54] Hamas announced the start of the operation, stating that it had fired over 5,000 rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israel within a span of 20 minutes. Israeli sources reported that at least 3,000 projectiles had been launched from Gaza. At least five people were killed by the rocket attacks.[27][72][30][73] Explosions were reported in areas surrounding the Strip and in cities in the Sharon Plain including Gedera, Herzliyya,[5] Tel Aviv, and Ashkelon.[73] Air raid sirens were also activated in Beer Sheva, Jerusalem, Rehovot, Rishon Lezion, and Palmachim Airbase.[74][75][76] Hamas issued a call to arms, with senior military commander Mohammad Deif calling on "Muslims everywhere to launch an attack".[30] Palestinian militants also opened fire on Israeli boats off the Gaza Strip, while clashes broke out between Palestinians and the Israel Defense Forces in the eastern section of the Gaza perimeter fence.[74] In the evening Hamas launch contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 57 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Operation_Al-Aqsa_Flood responseCode 3 200
