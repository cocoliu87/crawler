It was a tri-nation series between South Africa A, Afghanistan A and India A.[1] The one-day matches were played as List A fixtures. Following the List A fixtures, South Africa A and India A played two four-day games with first-class status, also called unofficial Tests. Originally, Australia A were scheduled to play in the series, but they withdrew in early July following an ongoing pay dispute with Cricket Australia.[2][3] Later that month, Afghanistan A were named as their replacement, after the national team was awarded Test match status the previous month.[4] India A won the tri-series, beating South Africa A by 7 wickets in the final of the competition.[5] The first-class series was drawn 1–1, with South Africa A winning the first match and India A winning the second.[6] List A series[edit] Squads[edit] Afghanistan A [4] India A [7] South Africa A [8] Shafiqullah (c) Afsar Zazai (wk) Usman Ghani Javed Ahmadi Rahmat Shah Younas Ahmadzai Nasir Jamal Najibullah Zadran Karim Janat Sharafuddin Ashraf Yamin Ahmadzai Fareed Ahmad Ihsanullah Younas Ahmadzai Nawaz Khan Mohammad Ibrahim Manish Pandey (c) Mandeep Singh Shreyas Iyer Sanju Samson Deepak Hooda Karun Nair Krunal Pandya Rishabh Pant (wk) Vijay Shankar Axar Patel Yuzvendra Chahal Jayant Yadav Basil Thampi Mohammed Siraj Shardul Thakur Siddarth Kaul Khaya Zondo (c) Farhaan Behardien Junior Dala Henry Davids Beuran Hendricks Reeza Hendricks Heinrich Klaasen Mangaliso Mosehle Willem Mulder Dane Paterson Aaron Phangiso Dwaine Pretorius Tabraiz Shamsi Jason Smith Jon-Jon Smuts 1st match[edit] 26 July 2017 Scorecard India A 152 (41.5 overs) v South Africa A 153/8 (37.4 overs) Manish Pandey 55 (95) Aaron Phangiso 4/30 (10 overs) Dwaine Pretorius 38 (54) Yuzvendra Chahal 3/41 (9.4 overs) South Africa A won by 2 wickets Groenkloof Oval, Pretoria Umpires: Adrian Holdstock (SA) and Bongani Jele (SA) Player of the match: Dwaine Pretorius (South Africa A) South Africa A won the toss and elected to field. 2nd match[edit] 28 July 2017 Scorecard Afghanistan A 149 (40.5 overs) v India A 150/3 (30.4 overs) Sharafuddin Ashraf 39* (27) Vijay Shankar 3/24 (7 overs) Karun Nair 57 (83) Yamin Ahmadzai 1/26 (7 overs) India A won by 7 wickets LC de Villiers Oval, Pretoria Umpires: Sam Nogajski (Aus) and Allahudien Paleker (SA) Player of the match: Karun Nair (India A) India A won the toss and elected to field. 3rd match[edit] 30 July 2017 Scorecard South Africa A 336/5 (50 overs) v Afghanistan A 172 (32.2 overs) Reeza Hendricks 173* (145) Rahmat Shah Zurmatai 2/58 (10 overs) Rahmat Shah Zurmatai 55 (54) Tabraiz Shamsi 4/19 (8 overs) South Africa A won by 164 runs Groenkloof Stadium, Pretoria Umpires: Adrian Holdstock (SA) and Bongani Jele (SA) Player of the match: Reeza Hendricks (South Africa A) Afghanistan A won the toss and elected to field. 4th match[edit] 1 August 2017 Scorecard India A 322/5 (50 overs) v Afghanistan A 209/9 (50 overs) Manish Pandey 86* (87) Sharafuddin Ashraf 2/48 (10 overs) Najibullah Zadran 62 (78) Mohammed Siraj 3/49 (8 overs) India A won by 113 runs LC de Villiers Oval, Pretoria Umpires: Sam Nogajski (Aus) and Brad White (SA) Player of the match: Manish Pandey (India A) Afghanistan A won the toss and elected to field. 5th match[edit] 3 August 2017 Scorecard South Africa A 266 (48.2 overs) v India A 267/9 (49.4 overs) Heinrich Klaasen 127 (108) Shardul Thakur 4/35 (8.2 overs) Manish Pandey 93* (85) Junior Dala 3/55 (9 overs) India A won by 1 wicket LC de Villiers Oval, Pretoria Umpires: Adrian Holdstock (SA) and Sam Nogajski (Aus) Player of the match: Heinrich Klaasen (South Africa A) India A won the toss and elected to field. 6th match[edit] 5 August 2017 Scorecard Afghanistan A 202/9 (50 overs) v South Africa A 203/7 (36.4 overs) Usman Ghani 54 (65) Aaron Phangiso 3/39 (10 overs) Reeza Hendricks 76 (76) Rahmat Shah 2/44 (9.4 overs) South Africa A won by 7 wickets LC de Villiers Oval, Pretoria Umpires: Bongani Jele (SA) and Brad White (SA) Player of the match: Aaron Phangiso (South Africa A) South Africa A won the toss and elected to field.
