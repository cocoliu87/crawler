Prior to entering politics, Iswaran worked in various organisations in both the public and private sectors, including Temasek Holdings and the Ministry of Trade and Industry. He made his political debut in the 1997 general election as part of a four-member PAP team contesting in West Coast GRC and won 70.14% of the vote. He has also held directorships in various organisations throughout his political career. In July 2023, Iswaran was summoned to assist in an unspecified corruption investigation by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB), and had since been ordered to go on a leave of absence, with a reduced pay and no access to government offices, until the investigation was complete. Education[edit] Iswaran attended Saint Andrew's School and National Junior College[5] before graduating from the University of Adelaide with first class honours, where he read economics, of which was provided for by a Colombo Plan scholarship.[3] He also holds a Master of Public Administration from Harvard University.[6] Career[edit] Prior to entering politics, Iswaran was Senior Vice President and Managing Director at Temasek Holdings (2003–2006), Director for International Trade at the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), Chief Executive Officer of the Singapore Indian Development Association (SINDA), and Director of Strategic Development at Singapore Technologies (1996–1998).[7][8] Throughout his political career, Iswaran concurrently held directorships in several organisations, including Quintiles Transnational, Sunningdale Tech,[9] Shin Corporation,[10] SciGen, PSA International, Sembcorp Industries,[11][12] and Hyflux.[8] Political career[edit] Minister for Transport S.

He switched to representing the West Coast ward of West Coast GRC from the 2001 general election onwards. From 1 September 2004 to 19 April 2006, Iswaran was Deputy Speaker of Parliament. On 1 July 2006, he was appointed Minister of State at the Ministry of Trade and Industry. After the 2006 general election, on 1 April 2008, Iswaran was promoted to Senior Minister of State at the Ministry of Trade and Industry. On 1 April 2009, he was given an additional appointment as Senior Minister of State at the Ministry of Education. Following the 2011 general election, Iswaran was promoted to full Minister in the Cabinet and appointed Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, Second Minister for Home Affairs, and Second Minister for Trade and Industry. After the 2015 general election, on 1 October 2015, he relinquished his three positions and took up the portfolio of Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) alongside Lim Hng Kiang, who was Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade). On 1 May 2018, he became Minister for Communications and Information, however he did continue in the Ministry of Trade and Industry as Minister In-Charge of Trade Relations. After the 2020 general election, Iswaran continued as Minister in the Ministry of Communications and Information. On 15 May 2021, after a Cabinet reshuffle, Iswaran became Minister for Transport while continuing his appointment as Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations. Corruption allegations[edit] On 11 July 2023, Iswaran was arrested and released on bail. He also had his passport impounded.[13] On 12 July 2023, Iswaran and other individuals were summoned to assist in an unspecified corruption investigation by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB). Upon being briefed on the investigation by the CPIB, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong instructed Iswaran to go on a leave of absence until the end of the investigations; Chee Hong Tat was appointed as the Acting Transport Minister.[14] Iswaran's case is the first high-profile graft investigation involving a minister since November 1986, when Minister for National Development Teh Cheang Wan was investigated by the CPIB for bribery allegations, although Teh committed suicide a month later before he could be formally charged.[15][16] The next day, the government announced that Iswaran would not have access to government offices and had to remain in Singapore until the investigations were completed. On 2 August 2023, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced that Iswaran had been interdicted with a reduced pay of S$8,500 as per civil service guidelines, given that there are no specific provisions that cover ministers under investigation. Iswaran still draws a monthly salary of S$16,000 as an MP as Parliament had not tabled a motion to remove it. Personal life[edit] Iswaran is married to Kay Mary Taylor. They have a daughter and two sons.[17] Notes[edit] ^ On leave since 12 July 2023. During this period, Senior Minister of State for Transport Chee Hong Tat has been serving as Acting Minister of Transport until the investigations are over.[1] References[edit] ^ "Transport Minister S Iswaran assisting in CPIB investigation, instructed to take leave of absence by PM Lee".
