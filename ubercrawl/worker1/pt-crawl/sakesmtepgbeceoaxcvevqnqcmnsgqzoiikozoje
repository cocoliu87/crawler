On 1 August 2021, it replaced the Management Committee of the State Administration Council, which had been in place since 19 February 2021, following the 2021 Myanmar coup d'état.[2][3][4] Some ministers were appointed by Min Aung Hlaing immediately following the coup on 1 February, in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services exercising emergency powers.[5] Due to the state of emergency, the cabinet is led by Prime Minister Min Aung Hlaing rather than Acting President Myint Swe, despite the president being the constitutional head of government.[6][7][8][9][10][11] Politics of Myanmar Constitution 2008 Constitution Constitutional Tribunal Chairman: Than Kyaw National Defence and Security Council Government President (list) Myint Swe (acting) State Administration Council Chairman: Min Aung Hlaing Vice Chairman: Soe Win Vice-President First: Myint Swe Second: Henry Van Thio Prime Minister (list) Min Aung Hlaing Deputy Prime Minister Soe Win Mya Tun Oo Tin Aung San Soe Htut Win Shein Cabinet Provisional Government Legislature (dissolved) House of Nationalities Speaker House of Representatives Speaker Opposition Judiciary Supreme Court Chief Justice: Htun Htun Oo Constitutional Tribunal Chairman: Than Kyaw Recent elections General: 2015 2020 Next Presidential: 2016 2018 Next Political parties Administrative divisions States, Regions and Union Territories Self-Administered Zones and Divisions Districts Townships Foreign relations Ministry of Foreign Affairs Minister: Wunna Maung Lwin Ministry of International Cooperation Minister: Ko Ko Hlaing Diplomatic missions of / in Myanmar Passport Visa requirements Visa policy Exiled government Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw National Unity Government President: Duwa Lashi La (acting) Prime Minister: Mahn Win Khaing Than Vice President: Duwa Lashi La Related topics Human rights National Human Rights Commission Naming issues Myanmar portal Other countries v t e Background[edit] The 2021 coup came in the aftermath of the general election on 8 November 2020, in which the National League for Democracy won 396 out of 476 seats in parliament, an even larger margin of victory compared to that in the 2015 election. The military's proxy party, the Union Solidarity and Development Party, won only 33 seats. The army disputed the results, claiming that the vote was fraudulent. The coup attempt had been rumored for several days, prompting statements of concern from Western powers such as France, the United States, and Australia.[12] On the morning of 1 February 2021, President Win Myint, State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, as well as several Union Ministers, State and Region Chief Ministers, State and Region Ministers, and elected MPs, were detained by the military.[13] Since then, the State Administration Council has governed the country.[9] The military deposed the elected civilian government and General Min Aung Hlaing, the commander-in-chief of Defence Services, announced the formation of a caretaker government with himself as prime minister and extended military rule through 2023, state media reported on 1 August 2021.[10][8] This caretaker government is the second in Burmese history since independence.[10] Government Reshuffle[edit] February 2023 reshuffle[edit] August 2023 reshuffle[edit] September 2023 resuffle[14][edit] On 25 September 2022, Deputy Prime Minister and Union Minister for Union Government Office 1 Lt-Gen Soe Htut was discharged to original military duties on 25 September 2023 under Order 86/2023.
