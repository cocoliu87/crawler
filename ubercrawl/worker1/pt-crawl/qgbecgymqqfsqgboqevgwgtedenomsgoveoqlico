A tetralogy (from Greek τετρα- tetra-, "four" and -λογία -logia, "discourse") is a compound work that is made up of four distinct works. The name comes from the Attic theater, in which a tetralogy was a group of three tragedies followed by a satyr play, all by one author, to be played in one sitting at the Dionysia as part of a competition.[1] Examples[edit] Literature[edit] Tetrateuch is a sometime name for the first four books of the Bible.[2] The Tetrateuch plus Deuteronomy are collectively referred to as the Pentateuch. Tintitives by Antiphon of Rhamnus; the author was an orator, and Tintitives is a kind of textbook for students.

Three of his tetralogies are known to have survived.[3] The traditional arrangement of the works of Plato into nine tetralogies, including some doubtful works, and the letters as a single work.

The term "quadrilogy", using the Latin prefix quadri- instead of the Greek, and first recorded in 1865,[7] has also been used for marketing the Alien movies.

I have always had a romantic idea that the writer or the artist was, as Coleridge and Virginia Woolf said, androgynous. The whole of The Virgin in the Garden quartet is about the desirability of an androgynous mind... JN & JF: I notice that the quartet which begins with The Virgin in the Garden is sometimes called The Frederica Quartet. ASB: My paperback publisher, you will be glad to hear, is going to make it a boxed set, and it's just going to be called The Quartet. It isn't Frederica's book--though she's the sort of person who would muscle in and try to take it! ^ Star Trek 4 potential release date, cast and everything you need to know ^ Victor L. Cahn.
