For each page with more than three section headings, a table of contents (TOC) is automatically generated. This page explains the syntax of these elements. For information about how to name sections or how to use sections to structure articles, please read the Guide to layout. Creation and numbering of sections For details on how to name sections, or about using them properly to structure articles, see Wikipedia:Guide to layout. Sections are created by creating their headings, as below. == Section ==
=== Subsection ===
==== Sub-subsection ====
 These are sometimes called "levels" based on the number of equal signs before and after, so that the top "Section" above with two equal signs is a "level two" heading, the subsection is a "level three" heading, and the "sub-subsection" is "level four". Please do not use a "level one" heading (only one equals sign on each side, i.e.: =Heading=). This would cause a section heading as large as the page title at the top of the page. The maximum level number is six. Heading names of sections (including subsections) should be unique on a page. Using the same heading more than once on a page causes problems: An internal link (wikilink) to a section, in the form [[Article name#Section heading]], will link only to the first section on the page with that name, which may not be the intended target of the link. See linking to sections of articles for further details. When a section with a duplicate name is edited, the edit history and summary will be ambiguous as to which section was edited. When saving the page after a section edit, the editor's browser may navigate to the wrong section. Numbering Sections are numbered in the table of contents (not applicable in Vector 2022). Sorting order For the ordering of (appendix & footer) sections, see: Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Layout § Order of article elements. Trailing sections The section and subsection hierarchy in wikitext is mainly determined by the level of the headings, so any text without a new heading is automatically considered part of the preceding section or subsection. This means there is no direct way to indicate that trailing text belongs to the parent section. If making this distinction is important, reordering the text or simply adding another subsection are common approaches. Table of contents (TOC) Shortcuts H:TOC WP:TOC "Wikipedia:Table of contents" redirects here. For Wikipedia's contents, see Wikipedia:Contents. An example Table of Contents as viewed in the default Vector 2022 skin Hiding the TOC For each page with at least four headings, a table of contents (TOC) is automatically generated from the section headings unless the magic word __NOTOC__ (with two underscores on either side of the word) is added to the article's wikitext. __NOTOC__ should not be used in articles that (a) have fewer than four headings or (b) do not fit on one screen.[1] Using certain templates, such as {{Compact ToC}}, will replace the regular table of contents functionality. Positioning the TOC When either __FORCETOC__ or __TOC__ (with two underscores on either side of the word) is placed in the wikitext, a TOC is generated even if the page has fewer than four headings. Using __FORCETOC__ places the TOC immediately before the first section heading. Using __TOC__ places the TOC at the same position as this code. Most articles have introductory text before the TOC, known as the "lead section". Although usually a section heading should immediately follow the TOC, using __TOC__ can prevent you from being forced to insert a meaningless heading just to position the TOC correctly (i.e. not too low). However, if there is any text at all between the TOC and the first heading, this will cause problems with accessibility. Floating the TOC The TOC can, in some instances, be floated either right or left using {{TOC right}} or {{TOC left}} when it is beneficial to the layout of the article, or when the default TOC gets in the way of other elements. Before changing the default TOC to a floated TOC, consider the following guidelines: If floating the TOC, it should be placed at the end of the lead section of the text, before the first section heading. Users of screen readers do not expect any text between the TOC and the first heading, and having no text above the TOC is confusing. See the last line in the information about elements of the lead section. When floating a TOC, check whether the page layout will be harmed if the TOC is hidden by the user. Long lists may create very long TOCs. The TOC should not be longer than necessary, whether it is floated or not. {{TOC limit}} can be used to reduce the length of the TOC by hiding nested subsections, rather than a floating TOC. The default TOC is placed before the first headline, but after any introductory text. If the introductory summary is long enough that a typical user has to scroll down to see the top of the TOC, you may float the TOC, so it appears closer to the top of the article. However, the floating TOC should in most cases follow at least the first paragraph of article text. Floating a wide TOC will produce a narrow column of readable text for users with low resolutions. If the TOC's width exceeds 30% of the user's visible screen (about twice the size of the Wikipedia navigation bar to the left), then it is not suitable for floating. (Percentages assume a typical user setup.) If text is trapped between a floating TOC and an image, floating can be cancelled at a certain text point, see Forcing a break. If the TOC is placed in the general vicinity of other floated images or boxes, it can be floated as long as the flowing text column does not become narrower than 30% of the average user's visible screen width. A left-floated TOC may affect bulleted or numbered lists. Template:TOC right was proposed for deletion in early July 2005, but there was no consensus on the matter. The archive of the discussion and voting regarding this may be seen at Wikipedia:Templates for deletion/TOCright. The Manual of Style discussion can be found here. Limiting the TOC's page width An extenuating circumstance may require the width of a TOC to be adjusted as a percentage of a page. For example: {{TOC left|width=30%}} Limiting the TOC's content depth Shortcut H:LIMITTOC By default, the TOC includes all the headings in the page, whatever their level. When an article or project page has a very large number of subsections, it may be appropriate to hide lower-level subsections from the TOC. You can specify a limit for the lowest-level section that should be displayed using {{TOC limit|n}}, where n is the number of = signs that are used on each side of the lowest-level section header that should be displayed (e.g. 3 to show all headings down to ===sub-sections=== but hide ====sub-sub-sections==== and all headings below that). The limit=n parameter can also be given to {{TOC left}} or {{TOC right}} the same way. Replacing the default TOC Shortcut WP:REPLACETOC The auto-generated TOC is not maximally appropriate or useful in all article types, such as long list articles and glossaries, so there are numerous replacement templates. To use one, place the replacement TOC template, such as {{Compact TOC}} (which can be customized for many list styles) where needed. You are encouraged to put __NOTOC__ at the top of the article to ensure correct functionality, but in many cases the regular TOC will be suppressed just by the addition of the replacement TOC template. Horizontal TOC The template {{Horizontal TOC}} lays out the TOC in a horizontal list rather than a vertical one. It can be practical in a TOC with many brief entries. The ability to display a long TOC without scrolling makes it suited for tables where the rows contain section headings. Example: Legality of cannabis by country – uses a concise but functional A–Z horizontal TOC. Example: Legality of cannabis by U.S. jurisdiction – uses two TOCs; a short, vertical one, and a long, horizontal one. Section linking See also: Help:Link § Section linking (anchors), and Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Linking § Section links In the HTML code for each section there is an "id" attribute holding the section title. This enables linking directly to sections. These section anchors are automatically used by MediaWiki when it generates a table of contents for the page, and therefore when a section heading in the ToC is clicked, it will jump to the section. Also, the section anchors can be manually linked directly to one section within a page. The HTML code generated at the beginning of this section, for example, is: <span class="mw-headline" id="Section_linking">Section linking</span>
 A link to this section (Section linking) looks like this: [[Help:Section#Section linking|Section linking]] (NB section links are case sensitive, including the first character (Help:Link).) To link to a section in the same page you can use [[#section name|displayed text]], and to link to a s contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 46 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Help:Section responseCode 3 200
