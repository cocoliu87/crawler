(August 2022) (template removal help) In logic, a quantifier is an operator that specifies how many individuals in the domain of discourse satisfy an open formula. For instance, the universal quantifier ∀ {\displaystyle \forall } in the first order formula ∀ x P ( x ) {\displaystyle \forall xP(x)} expresses that everything in the domain satisfies the property denoted by P {\displaystyle P} . On the other hand, the existential quantifier ∃ {\displaystyle \exists } in the formula ∃ x P ( x ) {\displaystyle \exists xP(x)} expresses that there exists something in the domain which satisfies that property. A formula where a quantifier takes widest scope is called a quantified formula. A quantified formula must contain a bound variable and a subformula specifying a property of the referent of that variable. Table of truth for Existential and Universal quantifiers.[1] The most commonly used quantifiers are ∀ {\displaystyle \forall } and ∃ {\displaystyle \exists } . These quantifiers are standardly defined as duals; in classical logic, they are interdefinable using negation. They can also be used to define more complex quantifiers, as in the formula ¬ ∃ x P ( x ) {\displaystyle \neg \exists xP(x)} which expresses that nothing has the property P {\displaystyle P} . Other quantifiers are only definable within second order logic or higher order logics. Quantifiers have been generalized beginning with the work of Mostowski and Lindström. In a first-order logic statement, quantifications in the same type (either universal quantifications or existential quantifications) can be exchanged without changing the meaning of the statement, while the exchange of quantifications in different types changes the meaning. As an example, the only difference in the definition of uniform continuity and (ordinary) continuity is the order of quantifications. First order quantifiers approximate the meanings of some natural language quantifiers such as "some" and "all". However, many natural language quantifiers can only be analyzed in terms of generalized quantifiers. Relations to logical conjunction and disjunction[edit] For a finite domain of discourse D = { a 1 , . . . a n } {\displaystyle D=\{a_{1},...a_{n}\}} , the universally quantified formula ∀ x ∈ D P ( x ) {\displaystyle \forall x\in D\;P(x)} is equivalent to the logical conjunction P ( a 1 ) ∧ . . . ∧ P ( a n ) {\displaystyle P(a_{1})\land ...\land P(a_{n})} . Dually, the existentially quantified formula ∃ x ∈ D P ( x ) {\displaystyle \exists x\in D\;P(x)} is equivalent to the logical disjunction P ( a 1 ) ∨ . . . ∨ P ( a n ) {\displaystyle P(a_{1})\lor ...\lor P(a_{n})} . For example, if B = { 0 , 1 } {\displaystyle B=\{0,1\}} is the set of binary digits, the formula ∀ x ∈ B x = x 2 {\displaystyle \forall x\in B\;x=x^{2}} abbreviates 0 = 0 2 ∧ 1 = 1 2 {\displaystyle 0=0^{2}\land 1=1^{2}} , which evaluates to true. Infinite domain of discourse[edit] Consider the following statement (using dot notation for multiplication): 1 · 2 = 1 + 1, and 2 · 2 = 2 + 2, and 3 · 2 = 3 + 3, ..., and 100 · 2 = 100 + 100, and ..., etc. This has the appearance of an infinite conjunction of propositions. From the point of view of formal languages, this is immediately a problem, since syntax rules are expected to generate finite words. The example above is fortunate in that there is a procedure to generate all the conjuncts. However, if an assertion were to be made about every irrational number, there would be no way to enumerate all the conjuncts, since irrationals cannot be enumerated. A succinct, equivalent formulation which avoids these problems uses universal quantification: For each natural number n, n · 2 = n + n. A similar analysis applies to the disjunction, 1 is equal to 5 + 5, or 2 is equal to 5 + 5, or 3 is equal to 5 + 5, ... , or 100 is equal to 5 + 5, or ..., etc. which can be rephrased using existential quantification: For some natural number n, n is equal to 5+5. Algebraic approaches to quantification[edit] It is possible to devise abstract algebras whose models include formal languages with quantification, but progress has been slow[clarification needed] and interest in such algebra has been limited. Three approaches have been devised to date: Relation algebra, invented by Augustus De Morgan, and developed by Charles Sanders Peirce, Ernst Schröder, Alfred Tarski, and Tarski's students. Relation algebra cannot represent any formula with quantifiers nested more than three deep. Surprisingly, the models of relation algebra include the axiomatic set theory ZFC and Peano arithmetic; Cylindric algebra, devised by Alfred Tarski, Leon Henkin, and others; The polyadic algebra of Paul Halmos. Notation[edit] The two most common quantifiers are the universal quantifier and the existential quantifier. The traditional symbol for the universal quantifier is "∀", a rotated letter "A", which stands for "for all" or "all". The corresponding symbol for the existential quantifier is "∃", a rotated letter "E", which stands for "there exists" or "exists".[2][3] An example of translating a quantified statement in a natural language such as English would be as follows. Given the statement, "Each of Peter's friends either likes to dance or likes to go to the beach (or both)", key aspects can be identified and rewritten using symbols including quantifiers. So, let X be the set of all Peter's friends, P(x) the predicate "x likes to dance", and Q(x) the predicate "x likes to go to the beach". Then the above sentence can be written in formal notation as ∀ x ∈ X , ( P ( x ) ∨ Q ( x ) ) {\displaystyle \forall {x}{\in }X,(P(x)\lor Q(x))} , which is read, "for every x that is a member of X, P applies to x or Q applies to x". Some other quantified expressions are constructed as follows, ∃ x P {\displaystyle \exists {x}\,P} [4] ∀ x P {\displaystyle \forall {x}\,P} for a formula P. These two expressions (using the definitions above) are read as "there exists a friend of Peter who likes to dance" and "all friends of Peter like to dance", respectively. Variant notations include, for set X and set members x: ⋁ x P {\displaystyle \bigvee _{x}P} ( ∃ x ) P {\displaystyle (\exists {x})P} [5] ( ∃ x . P ) {\displaystyle (\exists x\ .\ P)} ∃ x ⋅ P {\displaystyle \exists x\ \cdot \ P} ( ∃ x : P ) {\displaystyle (\exists x:P)} ∃ x ( P ) {\displaystyle \exists {x}(P)} [6] ∃ x P {\displaystyle \exists _{x}\,P} ∃ x , P {\displaystyle \exists {x}{,}\,P} ∃ x ∈ X P {\displaystyle \exists {x}{\in }X\,P} ∃ x : X P {\displaystyle \exists \,x{:}X\,P} All of these variations also apply to universal quantification. Other variations for the universal quantifier are ⋀ x P {\displaystyle \bigwedge _{x}P} [citation needed] ⋀ x P {\displaystyle \bigwedge xP} [7] ( x ) P {\displaystyle (x)\,P} [8] Some versions of the notation explicitly mention the range of quantification. The range of quantification must always be specified; for a given mathematical theory, this can be done in several ways: Assume a fixed domain of discourse for every quantification, as is done in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, Fix several domains of discourse in advance and require that each variable have a declared domain, which is the type of that variable. This is analogous to the situation in statically typed computer programming languages, where variables have declared types. Mention explicitly the range of quantification, perhaps using a symbol for the set of all objects in that domain (or the type of the objects in that domain). One can use any variable as a quantified variable in place of any other, under certain restrictions in which variable capture does not occur. Even if the notation uses typed variables, variables of that type may be used. Informally or in natural language, the "∀x" or "∃x" might appear after or in the middle of P(x). Formally, however, the phrase that introduces the dummy variable is placed in front. Mathematical formulas mix symbolic expressions for quantifiers with natural language quantifiers such as, For every natural number x, ... There exists an x such that ... For at least one x, .... Keywords for uniqueness quantification include: For exactly one natural number x, ... There is one and only one x such that .... Further, x may be replaced by a pronoun. For example, For every natural number, its product with 2 equals to its sum with itself. Some natural number is prime. Order of quantifiers (nesting)[edit] See also: Quantifier shift The order of quantifiers is critical to meaning, as is illustrated by the following two propositions: For every natural number n, there exists a natural number s such that s = n2. This is clearly true; it just asserts that every natural number has a square. The meaning of the assertion in which the order of quantifiers is reversed is different: There exists a natural number s such that for every natural number n, s = n2. This is clearly false; it asserts that there is a single natural number s that is the square of every natural number. This is because the syntax directs that any variable cannot be a function of subsequently introduced variables. A less trivial example from mathematical analysis regards the concepts of uniform and pointwise continuity, whose definitions differ only by an exchange in the positions of two quantifiers. A function f from R to R is called Pointwise continuous if ∀ ε > 0 ∀ x ∈ R ∃ δ > 0 ∀ h ∈ R ( | h | < δ ⇒ | f ( x ) − f ( x + h ) | < ε ) {\displaystyle \forall \varepsilon >0\;\forall x\in \mathbb {R} \;\exists \delta >0\;\forall h\in \mathbb {R} \;(|h|<\delta \,\Rightarrow \,|f(x)-f(x+h)|<\varepsilon )} Uniformly continuous if ∀ ε > 0 ∃ δ > 0 ∀ x ∈ R ∀ h ∈ R ( | h | < δ ⇒ | f ( x ) − f ( x + h ) | < ε ) {\displaystyle \forall \varepsilon >0\;\exists \delta >0\;\forall x\in \mathbb  contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 52 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Quantifier_(logic) responseCode 3 200
