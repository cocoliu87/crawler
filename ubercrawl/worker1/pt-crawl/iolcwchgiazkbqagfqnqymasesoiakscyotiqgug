iolcwchgiazkbqagfqnqymasesoiakscyotiqgug page 8229 This article describes the history of Australian cricket from the 1890–91 season until 1900. As in England, cricket in Australia from about 1890 until the First World War has been recalled as a Golden Age. The 1890s saw the emergence of great Australian players like Joe Darling, Clem Hill, Monty Noble and above all Victor Trumper, the supreme stylist who epitomised the glitter of this era not only in Australia but in England also. Domestic cricket[edit] The highlight of the decade was the establishment of the famous Sheffield Shield to be contested as a national championship by Australian colonial sides from the 1892–93 season. The Shield was donated by Lord Sheffield during the 1891–92 tour by his England XI, captained by W G Grace. For details of domestic matches in the 1890s, including Sheffield Shield contests, see List of Australian intercolonial cricket matches and Intercolonial cricket in Australia.
