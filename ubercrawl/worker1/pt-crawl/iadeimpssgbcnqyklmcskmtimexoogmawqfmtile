The combatants were elements of the Russian Armed Forces and Ukrainian Ground Forces. The battle lasted from 27 February to 31 March 2022 and ended with the withdrawal of Russian forces. The battle was part of a larger tactic to encircle Kyiv, the capital city of Ukraine.[14][15] The armed forces of Ukraine resisted the Russian advance in the capital's western suburbs of Irpin, Bucha, and Hostomel.[14][15] Bucha was among the locations that the Kyiv Oblast State Administration named as the most dangerous places in the Kyiv Oblast.[16] After Russian forces withdrew from Bucha, reports of uncovered atrocities by the Russian military attracted international attention. Prelude[edit] Main article: Battle of Antonov Airport On 25 February, Russian forces advanced on the suburb of Hostomel and its airport from the northwest after partially breaking through Ukrainian defenses at Ivankiv, capturing the airport and establishing a foothold in the town. Though there was still ongoing Ukrainian resistance in Hostomel, Russian forces began to advance south to capture the neighboring cities of Irpin and Bucha with the goal of encircling Kyiv.[14][15] Later that day Russian soldiers were seen looting an apartment building near Bucha.[17][18] Battle[edit] Initial fighting[edit] February[edit] On 25 February, due a lack of communications with the main invasion command and over-optimistic planning, a convoy of OMON and SOBR units from Kemerovo Oblast accidentally separated from the invasion forces and ended up charging at Kyiv by themselves. The convoy cruised through Bucha was ambushed at a bridge over the Irpin River, and the unarmored and under-equipped units were completely destroyed. Reportedly, of the 80 soldiers in the convoy, only 3 wounded men survived.[19] On 27 February, Russian ground forces advanced into Bucha.[20][21] The Russian force was composed of paratroopers, tanks, military engineering units, and reserves from the 36th Combined Arms Army.[15] The Russian force also had units of the Special Rapid Response Unit (SOBR) and the Special Purpose Mobile Unit (OMON), two special police forces within the National Guard of Russia.[22] Russian artillery bombarded the city, damaging several buildings and infrastructure. Some residents lost access to water, gas, and electricity due to the shelling.[20][21] Some elements of the Russian force were able to breakthrough Bucha and advanced towards the neighboring city of Irpin.[15][23] A Russian armored unit was recorded attacking a memorial for the War in Afghanistan in Bucha; the memorial is shaped like an APC.[24][25] Andriy Tsaplienko, a Ukrainian journalist, later reported that Russian forces attacked a civilian vehicle, killing a man and injuring another.[26] Destroyed Russian column on Vokzalna Street of Bucha. An industrial building in Chaiky village near Bucha, which held spray foam is hit by a Russian missile. Ukrainian forces used rocket and artillery bombardments and airstrikes to halt the Russian advances into Bucha.[27] The State Special Communications Service of Ukraine reported that Ukrainian artillery had shelled a convoy of Russian armored vehicles, with the Ukrainian government claiming that over 100 units of Russian equipment had been destroyed.[28][29] Ukrainian forces destroyed a bridge connecting Bucha and Irpin, killing an OMON officer and preventing Russian forces from advancing into Irpin.[22][26] Oleksiy Arestovych, a Ukrainian official, claimed that some residents of Bucha began fighting Russian forces, throwing Molotov cocktails at Russian vehicles and soldiers. Anton Herashchenko, another Ukrainian official, stated that the residents attacked a column of Russian armored vehicles, setting at least one vehicle on fire.[27][30][31] Later on 27 February, Ukrainian authorities warned the residents of Bucha not to get on buses that were evacuating out of the city, as Ukrainian officials had not initiated any evacuation procedures. Ukrainian officials claimed that it was part of a plan by Russian forces, wherein the Russians would use the civilians as human shields by following behind the buses, in order to gain entry into Kyiv.[32][33] On 28 February 2022, Anatoliy Fedoruk, the mayor of Bucha, published a video showing smoldering Russian vehicles. Fedoruk claimed that the Ukrainians suffered no casualties from the skirmish.[34] March[edit] On 1 March, photos of destroyed and abandoned Russian equipment began circulating through Ukrainian news media, with some describing Bucha as a graveyard for the destroyed Russian equipment.[35][36][37][38] On 2 March 2022, the Ukrainian government began sending humanitarian aid towards Bucha.[39] The following day, the Kyiv Oblast State Administration announced evacuations in both Bucha and Irpin. More than 1,500 women and children were reported to have evacuated by train, while 250 were evacuated by bus.[40][41] Ukrainian officials reported that the evacuations were complicated as some railway tracks had been destroyed during fighting.[42] Later on 3 March, the Ukrainian Ground Forces announced that Ukrainian forces recaptured Bucha, posting a video of Ukrainian soldiers raising the Ukrainian flag near the city council building.[43][44][45][46] Ukrainian emergency teams restored electricity to the city.[43][44] Russian forces continued to fight inside Bucha, and were repulsed by Ukrainian forces and pushed into the city's outskirts.[47][48] On 4 March 2022, Fedoruk confirmed that the city remained under Ukrainian control, despite Russian forces continuously launching attacks.[49] Russian forces killed three unarmed Ukrainian civilians who had just delivered dog food to a dog shelter and were on their way back home in a car.[50] By 5 March 2022, Russian forces continued to attack Bucha.[51] Later, Arestovych stated that Russian forces had captured both Bucha and Hostomel, and were not allowing civilians to evacuate.[52] At around 7:15 am that day, a pair of cars  contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 49 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Battle_of_Bucha responseCode 3 200
