Taxonomy and description[edit] Species of the genus Moniliformis are usually pseudosegmented and have a cylindrical proboscis with longitudinal rows of hooks that have posteriorly directed roots. Moniliformis are further characterized by the presence of a simple, double-walled proboscis receptacle with the outer wall having spirally aligned muscle fibers, brain at posterior end of receptacle, and dorsal and ventral lacunar canals.[1][2] The proboscis retractor muscles pierce both the posterior and ventral end or just posterior end of the receptacle.[3] The cerebral ganglion is in the mid to posterior region, and the lemnisci are long and flat and not bound to the body wall. These worms also lack protonephridia and males have eight cement glands, each with a giant nucleus, which are used to temporarily close the posterior end of the female after copulation.[1][2][4] Genetic analysis has been conducted on four species: Moniliformis moniliformis, M. saudi, M. cryptosaudi and M. kalahariensis.[5][6] Based on these results, Moniliformidae has been determined to be monophyletic.[5][6] Archiacanthocephala Archiacanthocephala Oligacanthorhynchidae Macracanthorhynchus ingens Oncicola venezuelensis Oligacanthorhynchus tortuosa Nephridiacanthus major Moniliformidae Moniliformis moniliformis Gigantorhynchida Mediorhynchus sp.

There are eight cement glands in the male and the eggs of the female are oval.[9] The species name acomysi derives from the host genus name Acomys.[12] Moniliformis aegyptiacus Meyer, 1932[13] M. aegyptiacus infests Meriones sinaiticus and the four-toed jerboa (Allactaga tetradactyla reported as Scarturus tetradactylus) in Egypt and the North African hedgehog (Atelerix algirus reported as Erinaceus algiris) in Tunis. The proboscis has 96 hooks arranged in twelve longitudinal rows with eight hooks per row. The eggs are oval.[9] The species name aegyptiacus derives from locality of the host, Egypt.[13] Moniliformis amini Martins, del Rosario Robles, and Navone 2017[9] M. amini was found in the small intestine parasitising the olive grass mouse (Abrothrix olivaceus) in the Santa Cruz Province, Argentina. The species name amini was named after Omar Amin, a parasitologist specializing in Acanthocephala. Sexual dimorphism is pronounced with female over four times longer than the male. The proboscis has 12 to 14 longitudinal rows of hooks with 10 to 12 hooks per row with the largest hooks in the female being apical ranging from 22.21 to 24.47 μm, the middle being 15.50 μm long and the posterior being the smallest at 12 μm long. The largest hooks in the male are 24 μm. There are eight cement glands in the male, the eggs are oval.[9] Moniliformis cestodiformis (Linstow, 1904)[b] M. cestodiformis has been found infesting hedgehogs of the genus Erinaceus in West Africa. The proboscis is between 400 and 500 µm long and 200 µm wide with 16 to 18 rows of 7 or 8 hooks each and no apical pores. The largest hooks are found anteriorly and are 30 to 32 µm long with no dorsoventral differences.[5] The eggs have 4 membranes and are 85 to 92 µm long and 49 to 51 µm wide giving them an elongation ratio of 1.73.[5][16] Moniliformis clarki (Ward, 1917)[c] M. Clarki Measurements[9] Female (mm) Male (mm) Length of proboscis ? 0.41–0.52 Width of proboscis ? 0.13–0.14 Length of proboscis receptacle ? 0.65–0.67 Width of proboscis receptacle ? 0.32–0.33 Length of trunk 120–250 61–85 Width of trunk 2.10–2.80 1.60–2.00 Length of lemnisci ? 3.46–4.79 × 0.13–0.18 Size of anterior testis 3.30–5.62 × 0.72–1.15 Size of posterior testis 3.97–4.29 × 0.72–1.17 Size of eggs 0.05–0.09 x 0.03–0.0 M. clarki commonly infects squirrels, chipmunks, deer mice, and gophers in North America.[5] If left untreated, it can kill its host. Ten cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus) were infected at the St. Louis Zoo with at least one being killed by the parasite.[17] Eggs of what is thought to be M. clarki due to the heavy population of common rodent hosts were discovered while examining human coprolite specimens gathered from Danger Cave in Utah. It was theorized that the man had either eaten a raw insect or an under cooked rodent.[18] The female is twice as long than the male. The proboscis has 12 or 13 longitudinal rows of hooks with six or seven hooks per row with the largest hooks being 23 to 28 mm long.[9] The eggs have 4 membranes and are 75 μm long and have an elongation ratio of 2.42.[16] Moniliformis convolutus Meyer, 1932 M. convolutus has been found infesting the large flying fox (Pteropus vampyrus) in Brazil. The proboscis is 500 µm long by 200 µm wide with 12 rows of 11 or 12 hooks each. The posterior hooks are rootless and the proboscis receptacle is 700 µm long.[5] Moniliformis cryptosaudi Amin, Heckmann, Sharifdini, and Albayati, 2019[6] M. cryptosaudi is a cryptic species with M. saudi being morphologically identical, apart from the metal content of the hooks, but genetically distinct. The hooks consist of a collagen material with very low levels of phosphorus and calcium which is in contrast to those of M. saudi which has high levels of these two metals. The trunk is between 20.50 ad 48.75 mm long by 0.72 to 1.05 mm wide in the male and 28.75 to 121.25 mm long by 0.65 to 2.25 mm wide in the much larger female.[6] The anterior trunk tapers in a fan-shaped pattern and has a collar of vertical plates.[5] The proboscis is between 343 and 416 µm long by 135 and 188 µm wide in the male and 300 to 416 µm long by 162 to 291 µm wide in the female. The proboscis is armed with 13 to 14 rows of hooks each containing 7 or 8 hooks with the largest being found anteriorly and measuring 25 to 35 µm long in the female and 16 to 25 µm long in the male. The ventral hooks longer than dorsal hooks. The proboscis receptacle is 624 to 1092 µm by 218 to 364 µm in the female and 551 to 936 µm by 200 to 291 µm in the male. The long lemnisci has 6 to 8 giant nuclei and measures 4.26 to 7.28 mm by 0.12 to 0.18 mm in the male and has 6 to 9 giant nuclei and measures 4.15 to 8.12 mm by 0.11 to 0.21 mm in the female. The short lemnisci has 3 or 4 giant nuclei and measures 3.74 to 5.72 mm by 0.09 to 0.15 mm in the male and has 5 or 6 giant nuclei and measures 2.18 to 7.25 mm by 0.11 to 0.21 mm in the female. The anterior testes are 1.65 to 3.67 mm by 0.40 to 0.62 mm in size and the posterior testes are 1.50 to 2.62 mm by 0.37 to 0.62 mm in size. In the male, the cement glands are 322 to 780 µm by 229 to 416 µm and Saefftigen's pouch measures 624 to 925 µm by 270 to 425 µm. In the female, The eggs are oval, measuring 50 to 104 µm by 25 to 36 µm.[6] The species name cryptosaudi refers to this cryptic status with M. saudi. It has been found in the intestine infesting the long-eared Hedgehog (Hemiechinus auritus) near Baqubah, Iraq.[6] Moniliformis echinosorexi Deveaux, Schmidt and Krishnasamy, 1988[19] M. echinosorexi has been found infesting the moonrat (Echinosorex gymnurus) in Malaysia but may also infect hedgehogs. The worms have 12 to 15 rows of between 11 and 13 hooks that change from 34 to 36 μm long. The proboscis receptacle is 1.2 to 2.0 mm long.[19] Males are between 95 and 98 mm long whereas females are longer ranging from 126 to 192 mm long. The proboscis is relatively large ranging from 690 to 1000 µm long with 12 to 15 rows of containing 11 and 13 hooks each. The posterior hooks do not have roots. The proboscis receptacle is large at 1.2 mm long in males and 2.0 mm long in females. The testes are relatively large being between 5.6 and 6.8 mm long. Lemnisci are similarly long at with three giant nuclei each.[5] The species name echinosorexi derives from the genus of the host, Echinosorex.[19] Monilifor contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 46 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Moniliformis responseCode 3 200
