The University of Wisconsin–Madison (University of Wisconsin, Wisconsin, UW, UW–Madison, or simply Madison) is a public land-grant research university in Madison, Wisconsin. Founded when Wisconsin achieved statehood in 1848, UW–Madison is the official state university of Wisconsin and the flagship campus of the University of Wisconsin System. It was the first public university established in Wisconsin and remains the oldest and largest public university in the state. UW–Madison became a land-grant institution in 1866.[9] The 933-acre (378 ha) main campus, located on the shores of Lake Mendota, includes four National Historic Landmarks.[10] The university also owns and operates the 1,200-acre (486 ha) University of Wisconsin–Madison Arboretum, located 4 miles (6.4 km) south of the main campus, which is also a National Historic Landmark.[11][12] UW–Madison is organized into 13 schools and colleges, which enrolled 35,184 undergraduate, 9,993 graduate, 2,046 special, and 2,663 professional students in 2022.[13] Its academic programs include 136 undergraduate majors, 148 master's degree programs, and 120 doctoral programs.[4][14] A major contributor to Wisconsin's economy, the university is the largest employer in the state,[15] with over 24,232 faculty and staff.[6] Wisconsin is one of the twelve founding members of the Association of American Universities, a selective group of major research universities in North America.[16] It is considered a Public Ivy,[17] and is classified as an R1 University.[18] UW–Madison was also the home of both the prominent "Wisconsin School" of economics and diplomatic history. In 2021, it had research and development expenditures of $1.4 billion, the eighth-highest among universities in the U.S.[19] As of March 2023[update], 20 Nobel laureates, 41 Pulitzer Prize winners, two Fields medalists, and one Turing Award recipient have been affiliated with UW–Madison as alumni, faculty, or researchers. It is also a leading producer of Fulbright Scholars and MacArthur Fellows.[20] As of November 2018[update], 14 CEOs of Fortune 500 companies attended UW–Madison, the most of any university in the nation.[21] The Wisconsin Badgers compete in 25 intercollegiate sports in the NCAA Division I Big Ten Conference and have won 31 national championships. Wisconsin students and alumni have won 50 Olympic medals (including 13 gold medals).[22] History[edit] Beginnings and formative years[edit] The university had its official beginnings when the Wisconsin Territorial Legislature in its 1838 session passed a law incorporating a "University of the Territory of Wisconsin", and a high-ranking Board of Visitors was appointed. However, this body (the predecessor of the U.W. board of regents) never actually accomplished anything before Wisconsin was incorporated as a state in 1848.[23] The Wisconsin Constitution provided for "the establishment of a state university, at or near the seat of state government..." and directed by the state legislature to be governed by a board of regents and administered by a Chancellor. On July 26, 1848, Nelson Dewey, Wisconsin's first governor, signed the act that formally created the University of Wisconsin.[24] John H. Lathrop became the university's first chancellor, in the fall of 1849.[25] With John W. Sterling as the university's first professor (mathematics), the first class of 17 students met at Madison Female Academy on February 5, 1849. Bascom Hall fire that destroyed the dome in 1916[26] A permanent campus site was soon selected: an area of 50 acres (20.2 ha) "bounded north by Fourth lake, east by a street to be opened at right angles with King street", [later State Street] "south by Mineral Point Road (University Avenue), and west by a carriage-way from said road to the lake." The regents' building plans called for a "main edifice fronting towards the Capitol, three stories high, surmounted by an observatory for astronomical observations."[27] This building, University Hall, now known as Bascom Hall, was finally completed in 1859. On October 10, 1916, a fire destroyed the building's dome, which was never replaced. North Hall, constructed in 1851, was actually the first building on campus. In 1854, Levi Booth and Charles T. Wakeley became the first graduates of the university, and in 1892 the university awarded its first PhD to future university president Charles R. Van Hise.[28] The Wisconsin Idea[edit] Research, teaching, and service at the UW is influenced by a tradition known as "the Wisconsin Idea", first articulated by UW–Madison President Charles Van Hise in 1904, when he declared "I shall never be content until the beneficent influence of the University reaches every home in the state."[29] The Wisconsin Idea holds that the boundaries of the university should be the boundaries of the state, and that the research conducted at UW–Madison should be applied to solve problems and improve health, quality of life, the environment, and agriculture for all citizens of the state. The Wisconsin Idea permeates the university's work and helps forge close working relationships among university faculty and students, and the state's industries and government.[30] Based in Wisconsin's populist history, the Wisconsin Idea continues to inspire the work of the faculty, staff, and students who aim to solve real-world problems by working together across disciplines and demographics.[31] World War II[edit] During World War II, University of Wisconsin was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.[32] Expansion[edit] Main article: University of Wisconsin System Over time, additional campuses were added to the university. The University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee was created in 1956, and UW–Green Bay and UW–Parkside in 1968. Ten freshman-sophomore centers were also added to this system.[33] In 1971, Wisconsin legislators passed a law merging the University of Wisconsin with the nine universities and four freshman-sophomore branch campuses of the Wisconsin State Universities System, creating the University of Wisconsin System and bringing the two higher education systems under a single board of regents. Student activism[edit] See also: Sterling Hall bombing Bascom Hill, 1968, with crosses placed by students protesting the Vietnam War, and sign reading, "Bascom Memorial Cemetery, Class of 1968" In the late 1960s and early 1970s, UW–Madison was shaken by a series of student protests, and by the use of force by authorities in response, comprehensively documented in the film The War at Home. The first major demonstrations protested the presence on campus of recruiters for the Dow Chemical Company, which supplied the napalm used in the Vietnam War. Authorities used force to quell the disturbance. The struggle was documented in the book, They Marched into Sunlight,[34] as well as the PBS documentary Two Days in October.[35] Among the students injured in the protest was former Madison mayor Paul Soglin. Another target of protest was the Army Mathematics Research Center (AMRC) in Sterling Hall, which was also home of the physics department. The student newspaper, The Daily Cardinal, published a series of investigative articles stating that AMRC was pursuing research directly pursuant to US Department of Defense requests, and supportive of military operations in Vietnam. AMRC became a magnet for demonstrations, in which protesters chanted "U.S. out of Vietnam! Smash Army Math!" On August 24, 1970, near 3:40 am, a bomb exploded next to Sterling Hall, aimed at destroying the Army Math Research Center.[36] Despite the late hour, a post doctoral physics researcher, Robert Fassnacht, was in the lab and was killed in the explosion. The physics department was severely damaged, while the intended target, the AMRC, was scarcely affected. Karleton Armstrong, Dwight Armstrong, and David Fine were found responsible for the blast. Leo Burt was identified as a suspect, but was never apprehended or tried.[37] Timeline of notable events[edit] Notable moments in the history of the University of Wisconsin–Madison include: 1848 on July 26, act creating the university signed by the governor[24] 1849 on February 5, the first class meets[24] 1863 Female students first admitted to University of Wisconsin during the American Civil War[38][39][40] 1866 State legislature designated the university as the Wisconsin land-grant institution[24] 1875 William Smith Noland is the first known African-American to graduate from the university.[24][41] 1888 Science Hall is contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 57 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin responseCode 3 200
