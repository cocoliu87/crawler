Events[edit] August 4 – The Billboard's American Folk Tunes column reported that Gene Autry had signed a long-term recording contract with Columbia Records. The source of the information was Art Satherly, described as "the grand old man of Western music". Art moved over to Columbia Records when CBS purchased American Record Corporation (ARC) in December 1938, and currently manages and produces Okeh Record's stable of artists, which includes Autry, Bob Wills, Ted Daffan, Johnny Bond, Al Dexter, Wiley Walker and Gene Sullivan, Spade Cooley, Roy Acuff and Fred Rose. Columbia is in the process of phasing out the Okeh label, and future releases will be on the parent label.[1] Top hits of the year[edit] Number one hits[edit] (As certified by Billboard magazine) US Single Artist February 3 "I'm Losing My Mind Over You" Al Dexter "March 17 "There's a New Moon Over My Shoulder" Jimmie Davis March 31 "Shame on You" Spade Cooley "April 14 "Smoke on the Water" Bob Wills May 19 "At Mail Call Today" Gene Autry July 7 "Stars and Stripes on Iwo Jima" Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys July 28 "Oklahoma Hills" Jack Guthrie August 25 "You Two-Timed Me One Time Too Often" Tex Ritter October 27 "With Tears in My Eyes" Wesley Tuttle Nov 17 "Sioux City Sue" Dick Thomas Nov 24 "Shame on You" Lawrence Welk Orchestra with Red Foley Dec 8 "It's Been So Long Darling" Ernest Tubb Dec 15 "Silver Dew on the Blue Grass Tonight" Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys Top Hillbilly (Country) Recordings 1945[edit] "Shame On You" by Spade Cooley was easily the number one record with 292 points. Despite 11 weeks at no. 1, "You Two Timed Me One Time Too Often" finished second with 240 points, because "Shame On You" had 33 top ten weeks, to only 21 for the latter. "Sioux City Sue" had 30 top ten weeks, but only 4 at no. 1. 1945's year-end list of The Billboard's "Most Played Juke Box Folk Records" represented the first Country music (referred to at the time as "Hillbilly") chart in the lineage of today's "Hot Country Songs". Note that it was based on weekly reports supplied by a sampling of Juke Box operators nationwide; Billboard would not add Country Sales and Air Play charts until 1948 and 1950, respectively. Each week, a score of 15 points was assigned for the no. 1 record, 9 points for no. 2, 8 points for no. 3, and so on, and the total of all weeks determined the final rank. Records that entered the chart in December 1944, or remained on the chart after December 1945 received points for their full chart runs. Appearances on other Billboard charts had no effect on ranking, but are listed for reference. Additional information can be found at List of Most Played Juke Box Folk Records number ones of 1945.
