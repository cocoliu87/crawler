The Official Audio Streaming Chart (previously the Official Streaming Chart) is a music chart based on plays of songs through audio streaming services (including Spotify, Deezer, Google Play Music, Apple Music and Tidal) in the United Kingdom.[1] It features data from both premium and ad-supported services.[2] It is compiled weekly by the Official Charts Company (OCC), and was initially published both on their official website OfficialCharts.com (Top 100), and in the magazine Music Week (Top 75). As of the chart dated 12 July 2014 —the date of inclusion of streaming data into the UK Singles Chart— the Official Streaming Chart was relaunched as the Official Audio Streaming Chart.[3] The Top 100 is published on the OCC website. The first song to top the rebranded chart was "Sing" by Ed Sheeran. The chart was first launched on 14 May 2012.[4] Its first number one was "Call Me Maybe" by Carly Rae Jepsen.[5] At the time of the chart's launch, the most streamed artist of the year was Ed Sheeran.[6] Sheeran remarked that streaming services had "always been an important way for [him] to get music out to [his] fans".[7] Martin Talbot, managing director of the OCC, stated that the chart represented "a true coming-of-age moment for music streaming in the UK".[8] In 2015, an Official Albums Streaming Chart was launched. This uses the same streaming sources as the Official Audio Streaming Chart to measure how many times albums have been streamed each week.[9] Number ones[edit] Key No. nth song to top the Official Audio Streaming Chart re Return of a song to number one † Most-streamed song of the year[a] Contents 2012 • 2013 • 2014 • 2015 • 2016 • 2017 • 2018 • 2019 • 2020s → No. Artist[b] Song[b] Record label[c] Reached number one (for the week ending)[b] Weeks at number one[b] 2012 1 Carly Rae Jepsen "Call Me Maybe" Interscope 19 May 2012 2 2 fun. featuring Janelle Monáe "We Are Young" Atlantic/Fueled by Ramen 2 June 2012 4 3 Flo Rida "Whistle" Atlantic 30 June 2012 2 4 Maroon 5 featuring Wiz Khalifa "Payphone" A&M/Octone 14 July 2012 5 5 Florence and the Machine "Spectrum (Say My Name)" Island 18 August 2012 1 6 Wiley featuring Ms D "Heatwave" One More Tune/Warner Bros. 24 August 2012 3 re Florence and the Machine "Spectrum (Say My Name)" Island 15 September 2012 1 7 Taylor Swift "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" Mercury 22 September 2012 1 8 The Script featuring will.i.am "Hall of Fame" Epic/Phonogenic 29 September 2012 2 9 Psy "Gangnam Style" Island 13 October 2012 3 10 Rihanna "Diamonds" Def Jam 3 November 2012 1 11 Swedish House Mafia featuring John Martin "Don't You Worry Child" Virgin 17 November 2012 1 12 Labrinth featuring Emeli Sandé "Beneath Your Beautiful" Syco 24 November 2012 4 13 Bruno Mars "Locked Out of Heaven" Atlantic 22 December 2012 1 14 Olly Murs "Troublemaker" Epic 29 December 2012 1 2013 15 James Arthur "Impossible" Syco 5 January 2013 3 16 will.i.am featuring Britney Spears "Scream & Shout" Interscope 26 January 2013 3 17 Macklemore & Ryan Lewis featuring Wanz "Thrift Shop" Macklemore 16 February 2013 4 18 Bastille "Pompeii" Virgin 16 March 2013 7 19 Daft Punk featuring Pharrell Williams "Get Lucky" † Columbia 4 May 2013 7 20 Robin Thicke featuring T.I. and Pharrell Williams "Blurred Lines" Interscope 22 June 2013 6 21 Avicii featuring Aloe Blacc "Wake Me Up" Positiva/PRMD 3 August 2013 7 22 Katy Perry "Roar" Virgin 21 September 2013 3 23 OneRepublic "Counting Stars" Interscope 12 October 2013 5 24 Lorde "Royals" Virgin 16 November 2013 1 25 Eminem featuring Rihanna "The Monster" Interscope 23 November 2013 6 2014 26 Mariah Carey "All I Want for Christmas Is You" Columbia 4 January 2014 1 27 Pharrell Williams "Happy" Columbia 11 January 2014 1 28 Pitbull featuring Kesha "Timber" J/Mr. 305/Polo Grounds 18 January 2014 3 29 Clean Bandit featuring Jess Glynne "Rather Be" † Atlantic 8 February 2014 10 30 John Legend "All of Me" Columbia 19 April 2014 1 re Clean Bandit featuring Jess Glynne "Rather Be" † Atlantic 26 April 2014 1 re John Legend "All of Me" Columbia 3 May 2014 1 31 Mr Probz "Waves" Left Lane 10 May 2014 8 32 Ed Sheeran "Sing" Asylum 5 July 2014 3[d] 33 Ariana Grande featuring Iggy Azalea "Problem" Republic 26 July 2014 2 34 Magic!
