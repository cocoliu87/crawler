Due to the country's long period of military rule, it has not been uncommon for the prime minister to be a serving (or recently retired) military officer. The position was abolished according to the current Constitution (adopted in 2008). It provided that the president is both the head of state and head of government. On 1 August 2021, State Administration Council formed the caretaker government and vice chairman of SAC became Deputy Prime Minister.[2][3] Deputy prime ministers of Burma/Myanmar (1948–present)[edit] (Dates in italics indicate de facto continuation of office) No. Portrait Name (Birth–Death) Term of office Political party Took office Left office Time in office Union of Burma (1948–1974)[edit] 1 Bo Let Ya ဗိုလ်လက်ျာ (1911–1978) 4 January 1948 14 September 1948 254 days Military 2 Kyaw Nyein ကျော်ငြိမ်း (1913–1986) 14 September 1948 2 April 1949 200 days Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League 3 Ne Win နေဝင်း (1911–2002) 2 April 1949 10 December 1949 252 days Military 4 Sao Hkun Hkio စဝ်ခွန်ချို (1912–1990) 10 December 1949 29 October 1958[a] 8 years, 323 days Independent 5 Thein Maung သိမ်းမောင် (1890-1975) 29 October 1958 27 February 1959 121 days Independent 6 Lun Baw လွန်းဘော် 27 February 1959 4 April 1960[b] 1 year, 37 days Independent (4) Sao Hkun Hkio စဝ်ခွန်ချို (1912–1990) 4 April 1960 2 March 1962 (deposed.) 1 year, 335 days Independent Position abolished (2 March 1962 – 2 March 1974) Socialist Republic of Union of Burma (1974–1988)[edit] 7 U Lwin ဦးလွင် (1924–2011) 2 March 1974[4] 29 March 1977 3 years, 27 days Burma Socialist Programme Party 8 Tun Tin ထွန်းတင် (1920–2020) 29 March 1977 26 July 1988 (resigned.) 11 years, 119 days Burma Socialist Programme Party Thura Kyaw Htin သူရကျော်ထင် (1925-1996) 9 November 1981 18 September 1988 (resigned.) 6 years, 314 days Military (until 4 November 1985) Burma Socialist Programme Party (from 4 November 1985) 9 Union of Burma /Myanmar (1988–2011)[edit] 10 Than Shwe သန်းရွှေ (born 1933) 21 September 1988 23 April 1992 3 years, 215 days Military 11 Khin Maung Yin ခင်မောင်ရင် 17 July 1995[5] 15 November 1997 2 years, 121 days Military 12 Maung Maung Khin မောင်မောင်ခင် 15 November 1997[6] 25 August 2003 5 years, 283 days Military 13 Tun Tin တင်ထွန်း 15 November 1997[6] 25 August 2003 5 years, 283 days Military 14 Tin Hla တင်လှ (born 1939) 14 November 1998 14 November 2001 3 years, 0 days Military Position abolished (25 August 2003 – 30 March 2011) Republic of the Union of Myanmar (2011–present)[edit] Position abolished (30 March 2011 – 1 August 2021) 15 Soe Win စိုးဝင်း (born 1960) 1 August 2021 Incumbent 2 years, 110 days Military 16 Mya Tun Oo မြထွန်းဦး (born 1961) 1 February 2023 Incumbent 291 days Military 17 Tin Aung San တင်အောင်စန်း (born 1960) 1 February 2023 Incumbent 291 days Military 18 Soe Htut စိုးထွဋ် (born 1961) 1 February 2023 25 September 2023[7] 236 days Military 19 Win Shein ဝင်းရှိန် (born 1957) 1 February 2023 Incumbent 291 days Independent See also[edit] Myanmar Politics of Myanmar List of colonial governors of Burma President of Myanmar Prime Minister of Myanmar State Counsellor of Myanmar Vice President of Myanmar Lists of office-holders Notes[edit] ^ Handed over power to the military. ^ Handed back power to the civilian government after the 1960 general election.
