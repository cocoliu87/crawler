Potential energy In the case of a bow and arrow, when the archer does work on the bow, drawing the string back, some of the chemical energy of the archer's body is transformed into elastic potential energy in the bent limb of the bow. When the string is released, the force between the string and the arrow does work on the arrow. The potential energy in the bow limbs is transformed into the kinetic energy of the arrow as it takes flight.

Common types of potential energy include the gravitational potential energy of an object, the elastic potential energy of an extended spring, and the electric potential energy of an electric charge in an electric field. The unit for energy in the International System of Units (SI) is the joule (symbol J). Potential energy is associated with forces that act on a body in a way that the total work done by these forces on the body depends only on the initial and final positions of the body in space. These forces, whose total work is path independent, are called conservative forces. If the force acting on a body varies over space, then one has a force field; such a field is described by vectors at every point in space, which is in-turn called a vector field. A conservative vector field can be simply expressed as the gradient of a certain scalar function, called a scalar potential. The potential energy is related to, and can be obtained from, this potential function. Overview There are various types of potential energy, each associated with a particular type of force. For example, the work of an elastic force is called elastic potential energy; work of the gravitational force is called gravitational potential energy; work of the Coulomb force is called electric potential energy; work of the strong nuclear force or weak nuclear force acting on the baryon charge is called nuclear potential energy; work of intermolecular forces is called intermolecular potential energy. Chemical potential energy, such as the energy stored in fossil fuels, is the work of the Coulomb force during rearrangement of configurations of electrons and nuclei in atoms and molecules. Thermal energy usually has two components: the kinetic energy of random motions of particles and the potential energy of their configuration. Forces derivable from a potential are also called conservative forces. The work done by a conservative force is W = − Δ U {\displaystyle W=-\Delta U} where Δ U {\displaystyle \Delta U} is the change in the potential energy associated with the force. The negative sign provides the convention that work done against a force field increases potential energy, while work done by the force field decreases potential energy. Common notations for potential energy are PE, U, V, and Ep. Potential energy is the energy by virtue of an object's position relative to other objects.[6] Potential energy is often associated with restoring forces such as a spring or the force of gravity. The action of stretching a spring or lifting a mass is performed by an external force that works against the force field of the potential. This work is stored in the force field, which is said to be stored as potential energy. If the external force is removed the force field acts on the body to perform the work as it moves the body back to the initial position, reducing the stretch of the spring or causing a body to fall. Consider a ball whose mass is m and whose height is h. The acceleration g of free fall is approximately constant, so the weight force of the ball mg is constant. The product of force and displacement gives the work done, which is equal to the gravitational potential energy, thus U g = m g h . {\displaystyle U_{g}=mgh.} The more formal definition is that potential energy is the energy difference between the energy of an object in a given position and its energy at a reference position. Work and potential energy Potential energy is closely linked with forces. If the work done by a force on a body that moves from A to B does not depend on the path between these points (if the work is done by a conservative force), then the work of this force measured from A assigns a scalar value to every other point in space and defines a scalar potential field. In this case, the force can be defined as the negative of the vector gradient of the potential field. If the work for an applied force is independent of the path, then the work done by the force is evaluated from the start to the end of the trajectory of the point of application. This means that there is a function U(x), called a "potential", that can be evaluated at the two points xA and xB to obtain the work over any trajectory between these two points. It is tradition to define this function with a negative sign so that positive work is a reduction in the potential, that is W = ∫ C F ⋅ d x = U ( x A ) − U ( x B ) {\displaystyle W=\int _{C}\mathbf {F} \cdot d\mathbf {x} =U(\mathbf {x} _{\text{A}})-U(\mathbf {x} _{\text{B}})} where C is the trajectory taken from A to B. Because the work done is independent of the path taken, then this expression is true for any trajectory, C, from A to B. The function U(x) is called the potential energy associated with the applied force. Examples of forces that have potential energies are gravity and spring forces. Derivable from a potential In this section the relationship between work and potential energy is presented in more detail. The line integral that defines work along curve C takes a special form if the force F is related to a scalar field U′(x) so that F = ∇ U ′ = ( ∂ U ′ ∂ x , ∂ U ′ ∂ y , ∂ U ′ ∂ z ) . {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} ={\nabla U'}=\left({\frac {\partial U'}{\partial x}},{\frac {\partial U'}{\partial y}},{\frac {\partial U'}{\partial z}}\right).} This means that the units of U′ must be this case, work along the curve is given by W = ∫ C F ⋅ d x = ∫ C ∇ U ′ ⋅ d x , {\displaystyle W=\int _{C}\mathbf {F} \cdot d\mathbf {x} =\int _{C}\nabla U'\cdot d\mathbf {x} ,} which can be evaluated using the gradient theorem to obtain W = U ′ ( x B ) − U ′ ( x A ) . {\displaystyle W=U'(\mathbf {x} _{\text{B}})-U'(\mathbf {x} _{\text{A}}).} This shows that when forces are derivable from a scalar field, the work of those forces along a curve C is computed by evaluating the scalar field at the start point A and the end point B of the curve. This means the work integral does not depend on the path between A and B and is said to be independent of the path. Potential energy U = −U′(x) is traditionally defined as the negative of this scalar field so that work by the force field decreases potential energy, that is W = U ( x A ) − U ( x B ) . {\displaystyle W=U(\mathbf {x} _{\text{A}})-U(\mathbf {x} _{\text{B}}).} In this case, the application of the del operator to the work function yields, ∇ W = − ∇ U = − ( ∂ U ∂ x , ∂ U ∂ y , ∂ U ∂ z ) = F , {\displaystyle {\nabla W}=-{\nabla U}=-\left({\frac {\partial U}{\partial x}},{\frac {\partial U}{\partial y}},{\frac {\partial U}{\partial z}}\right)=\mathbf {F} ,} and the force F is said to be "derivable from a potential".[7] This also necessarily implies that F must be a conservative vector field. The potential U defines a force F at every point x in space, so the set of forces is called a force field. Computing potential energy Given a force field F(x), evaluation of the work integral using the gradient theorem can be used to find the scalar function associated with potential energy. This is done by introducing a parameterized curve γ(t) = r(t) from γ(a) = A to γ(b) = B, and computing, ∫ γ ∇ Φ ( r ) ⋅ d r = ∫ a b ∇ Φ ( r ( t ) ) ⋅ r ′ ( t ) d t , = ∫ a b d d t Φ ( r ( t ) ) d t = Φ ( r ( b ) ) − Φ ( r ( a ) contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 50 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Potential_energy responseCode 3 200
