Thanks. Archived discussion for March 2006 from Wikipedia:In the news section on the Main Page/Candidates. March 31, 2006 Jack Abramoff scandals: Lobbyist Tony C. Rudy, former chief of staff for Rep. Tom DeLay (R-TX), pleads guilty to conpiracy and agrees to cooperate with the ongoing investigation into the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal.[1] I dunno if this really qualifies. One lobbyist pleading guilty is not huge news, particularly internationally. --Golbez 21:13, 31 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Viktor Yushchenko Viktor Yushchenko In Ukraine, President Viktor Yushchenko's Our Ukraine electoral alliance is soundly defeated in the 2006 parliamentary election.

If there isn't much to write about, how notable is this tragedy ? I just posted this on Current events (See ITN guideline #1). Hope this page can grow from the 2 sentences it has right now into a decent article. -- PFHLai 05:55, 31 March 2006 (UTC) Apparently, I can't count.... It actually has 3 sentences. -- PFHLai 16:51, 31 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] It does have more than 3 lines now. Please take a look. - Ganeshk (talk) 00:48, 1 April 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Protests against H.R. 4437, which would would classify illegal aliens as felons, spread across the U.S.(London Times)(Tennessean) Kaldari 18:43, 30 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] A bit late, but there is an article (which I've bolded) so I won't completely discard it, but I'll let others make that decision. Still, it is now 5 days out of date. --Golbez 19:12, 30 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] NASA and the Russian Federal Space Agency launch the thirteenth mission to the International Space Station today at 0230 UTC when Expedition 13 took off from the ground.

The Expedition 13 page looks a bit empty in the lower half. --PFHLai 16:32, 30 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Condoleezza Rice's visit to a mosque as part of her visit to the north west of England is cancelled in the face of anti-war protests.[1] TreveXtalk 17:09, 30 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] I won't put an article currently on AfD on ITN. --Golbez 19:12, 30 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] March 29, 2006 Afghanistan apostasy crisis: Afghani Christian convert Abdul Rahman arrives in Italy after being granted asylum. --Kitch 18:02, 29 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Article not updated yet. -- PFHLai 18:06, 29 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Now posted, but the update was just a one-liner.... oh, well.... -- PFHLai 18:21, 29 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] ESPN REPORTS MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE FORMAL INVESTIGATION INTO BARRY BONDS' ALLEGED STEROID USE OMG!

He has applied to the United Nations to assist in asylum outside Afghanistan. --Kitch 12:52, 28 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Posted a shorter version. Did not mention asylum yet, will wait till it's clear where he's going. -- PFHLai 14:43, 28 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] March 27, 2006 Zacarias Moussaoui Zacarias Moussaoui Zacarias Moussaoui, the so-called "20th 9/11 hijacker" surprises a Virginia courtroom with the revelation that he and "shoe bomber" Richard Reid were intended by Al-Qaeda to crash a hijacked airplane into the White House in the attacks of September 11, 2001. --Saforrest 22:36, 27 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Posting. --Golbez 22:56, 27 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Wait, strike that. The article isn't update, which is annoying, as I figured this would have been updated very quickly. --Golbez 23:00, 27 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Updated now. Sorry, I didn't even think to check the article before, I just assumed it would be updated instantaneously! I'm shocked I was the first one. --Saforrest 00:48, 28 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Posted a shorter version. I've added it to Current events as well. -- PFHLai 14:45, 28 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Flag of Ukraine In Ukraine, preliminary results of the 2006 parliamentary election give former Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych and his pro-Russian Party of Regions a narrow lead over the Yulia Tymoshenko Electoral Bloc, with President Viktor Yushchenko's Our Ukraine Bloc trailing in third place. (This may be a day too early, but seems like a good excuse to get rid of the ugly rocket picture on ITN right now.) -- 199.71.174.100 22:32, 27 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Yes, it is too early, but fortunately, I'm popping up Moussaoui's mug. I like the rocket picture. :( --Golbez 22:56, 27 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] The rocket picture looks a lot better at its original size, but it's an awful image when it's squished into a tiny thumbnail. Anyway, Moussaoui's mugshot is good. Looking forward to seeing it on MainPage soon. Thanks. -- 199.71.174.100 23:03, 27 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Still too early. Looks like a coalition government is coming. Will wait till final results are released. -- PFHLai 14:48, 28 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] March 26, 2006 Charges of apostasy against Abdul Rahman in Afghanistan have been dropped, sparing him a possible sentence of death for converting to Christianity. --Kitch 17:44, 26 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] The Christian Convert in Afghanistan was acquitted: the text in the "In the News" box should be updated. — Preceding unsigned comment added by Silver Marmot (talk • contribs) Moved from Talk:Main Page by HereToHelp 17:59, 26 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Updated (not by me). -- PFHLai 05:41, 27 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Is 'acquitted' the right word ? See Talk:Main_Page#2006-03-27_noon_ET_main_news_item_is_WRONG and Template_talk:In_the_news#Abdul_Rahman_(convert). --64.229.206.2 18:18, 27 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] I am dismayed that exactly the same comment I made yesterday is still applicable almost 30 hours later -- I guess this is rocket science 8-( : "How about inserting <br><br> (two line breaks) before all text, to start text below the rocket photo? As it is, the layout looks very unpresentable. Is there some other place I should be bringing this up?" --67-21-48-122 21:27, 27 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] This is not an ITN candidate, and will likely be ignored here on this candidates' page.

On 26 April 2006, World Intellectual Property Day takes place again. The day is intended to make you aware of how intellectual property touches your daily life - how copyright helps to bring music to your ears and art to your eyes; how industrial design shapes your world, and how trade marks indicate quality; how patenting promotes ingenious inventions that make life easier, faster and safer, and sometimes radically change your way of living.Gregorydavid 09:14, 25 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Please stop nominating trivial fake holidays for ITN. --Golbez 09:49, 25 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] ITN only takes news headlines of current events, not reminders for observances a month from now. -- PFHLai 23:11, 26 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Netball: World Champions, New Zealand, defeat Australia in the Gold Medal match, 60 - 55.

The Commonwealth Games closing is now the top news. -- PFHLai 23:17, 26 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] At the time of posting it was (relevant). I suggest unprotecting the page so relevant news can be posted, like this, so we don't have to wait around for admins for ages (around 17 hours for this post to get a reply). Not going to happen. It used to be open for anyone to edit, but someone had the bright idea of adding large images of penises to it. Protecting Wikipedia's reputation is more important than adding news items in a timely fashion. --Golbez 09:27, 27 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Brett Lee becomes the 12th Australian to take 200 wickets in Test cricket, playing for Australia against South Africa at Durban. ABC Sport (Australia) Darcyj 12:53, 26 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] The 12th ? Not sure if this is notable enough. I might consider it if Lee breaks the record with the most wickets ever..., etc. -- PFHLai 23:17, 26 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Well, that ain't gonn happen - he's 450 short and the leader is still playing (in the same team). But 200 is considered a fine achievement, and newsworthy in this sport. Darcyj 00:50, 27 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Like many other fine achievements in sport, it's very welcome on the Current Events Sports page, but not here. --Golbez 01:42, 27 March 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] March 25, 2006 The SpaceX Falcon 1 privately-owned space launch vehicle was lost shortly after lift-off from the Omelek Island launch facility on its maiden voyage contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 77 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Wikipedia:In_the_news/Candidates/March_2006 responseCode 3 200
