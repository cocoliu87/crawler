For historical climate trends, see Climate variability and change. Average surface air temperatures 2011–21 compared to 1956–76 Change in average surface air temperature since the Industrial Revolution, plus drivers for that change. Human activity has caused increased temperatures, with natural forces adding some variability.[1] In common usage, climate change describes global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its effects on Earth's climate system. Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous changes, and is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels.[2][3] Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices add to greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane.[4] Greenhouse gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight. Larger amounts of these gases trap more heat in Earth's lower atmosphere, causing global warming. Climate change is causing a range of increasing impacts on the environment. Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common.[5] Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to melting permafrost, glacial retreat and sea ice loss.[6][7] Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes.[8] Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct.[9] Even if efforts to minimise future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.[10] Climate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss. Human migration and conflict can also be a result.[11] The World Health Organization (WHO) calls climate change the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century.[12] Societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming.[13] Adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or drought-resistant crops partially reduces climate change risks, although some limits to adaptation have already been reached.[14] Poorer communities are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change.[15][16] Some effects of climate change: Wildfire intensified by heat and drought, bleaching of coral caused by marine heatwaves, and worsening droughts compromising water supplies. Many climate change impacts are already felt at the current 1.2 °C (2.2 °F) level of warming. Additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points, such as the melting of the Greenland ice sheet.[18] Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming "well under 2 °C". However, with pledges made under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.7 °C (4.9 °F) by the end of the century.[19] Limiting warming to 1.5 °C will require halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.[20] Reducing emissions requires reducing energy use and generating electricity from low-carbon sources rather than burning fossil fuels. This change includes phasing out coal and natural gas fired power plants while vastly increasing electricity generated from wind, solar, and nuclear power. This electricity will need to replace fossil fuels for powering transportation, heating buildings, and operating industrial facilities.[21][22] Carbon can also be removed from the atmosphere, for instance by increasing forest cover and farming with methods that capture carbon in soil.[23] Terminology Before the 1980s, when it was unclear whether the warming effect of increased greenhouse gases was stronger than the cooling effect of airborne particulates in air pollution, scientists used the term inadvertent climate modification to refer to human impacts on the climate.[24] In the 1980s, the terms global warming and climate change became more common. Though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably,[25] scientifically, global warming refers only to increased surface warming, while climate change describes the totality of changes to Earth's climate system.[24] Global warming—used as early as 1975[26]—became the more popular term after NASA climate scientist James Hansen used it in his 1988 testimony in the U.S. Senate.[27] Since the 2000s, climate change has increased in usage.[28] Climate change can also refer more broadly to both human-caused changes or natural changes throughout Earth's history.[29] Various scientists, politicians and media now use the terms climate crisis or climate emergency to talk about climate change, and global heating instead of global warming.[30] Observed temperature rise Main articles: Temperature record of the last 2,000 years and Instrumental temperature record In recent decades, new high temperature records have substantially outpaced new low temperature records on a growing portion of Earth's surface.[31] There has been an increase in ocean heat content during recent decades as the oceans absorb over 90% of the heat from global warming.[32] Multiple independent instrumental datasets show that the climate system is warming.[33] A so-called "global warming hiatus" from 1998 to 2013 when warming was relatively slow was likely caused by negative phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)[34][35] and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO).[36] The 2013-2022 decade warmed to an average 1.15 °C [1.00–1.25 °C] compared to the pre-industrial baseline (1850–1900).[37] Surface temperatures are rising by about 0.2 °C per decade,[38] with 2020 reaching a temperature of 1.2 °C above the pre-industrial era.[39] Since 1950, the number of cold days and nights has decreased, and the number of warm days and nights has increased.[40] Evidence of warming from air temperature measurements is reinforced by a wide range of other observations.[41][42] For example, changes to the natural water cycle have been predicted and observed, such as an increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation, melting of snow and land ice, and increased atmospheric humidity.[43] Flora and fauna are also behaving in a manner consistent with warming; for instance, plants are flowering earlier in spring.[44] Another key indicator is the cooling of the upper atmosphere, which demonstrates that greenhouse gases are trapping heat near the Earth's surface and preventing it from radiating into space.[45] Different regions of the world warm at different rates. The pattern is independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted, because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet. Since the pre-industrial period, the average surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global-average surface temperature.[46] This is because of the larger heat capacity of oceans, and because oceans lose more heat by evaporation.[47] The thermal energy in the global climate system has grown with only brief pauses since at least 1970, and over 90% of this extra energy has been stored in the ocean.[48][49] The rest has heated the atmosphere, melted ice, and warmed the continents.[50] The Northern Hemisphere and the North Pole have warmed much faster than the South Pole and Southern Hemisphere. The Northern Hemisphere not only has much more land, but also more seasonal snow cover and sea ice. As these surfaces flip from reflecting a lot of light to being dark after the ice has melted, they start absorbing more heat.[51] Local black carbon deposits on snow and ice also contribute to Arctic warming.[52] Arctic temperatures are increasing at over twice the rate of the rest of the world.[53] Melting of glaciers and ice sheets in the Arctic disrupts ocean circulation, including a weakened Gulf Stream, further changing the climate.[54] Temperature records prior to global warming Main articles: Climate variability and change and Paleoclimatology Global surface temperature reconstruction over the last 2000 years using proxy data from tree rings, corals, and ice cores in blue.[55] Directly observed data is in red.[56] Human beings evolved over the last few million years in a climate that cycled through ice ages, with global average temperature ranging between current levels and 5–6 °C colder than today.[57][58] The temperature record prior to human evolution includes hotter temperatures and occasional abrupt changes, such as the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum 55.5 million years ago.[59] Historical patterns of warming and cooling, like the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age, did not occur at the same time across different regions. Temperatures may have reached as high as those of the late 20th century in a limited set of regions.[60] There was little net warming between the 18th century and the mid-19th century. Climate information for that period comes from climate proxies, such as trees and ice cores.[61] Thermometer records began to provide global coverage around 1850.[62] Attribution of recent temperature rise Main article: Attribution of recent climate change Drivers of climate change from 1850–1900 to 2010–2019. There was no significant contribution from internal variability or solar and volcanic drivers. The climate system experiences various cycles on its own which can last for years (such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO)), decades or even centuries.[63] Other changes are caused by an imbalance of energy that is "external" to the climate system, but not always external  contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 48 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Climate_change responseCode 3 200
