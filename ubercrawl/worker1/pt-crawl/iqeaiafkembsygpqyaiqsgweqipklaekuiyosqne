It is the largest stadium in the world, with a seating capacity of 132,000 spectators.[13] The stadium is owned by the Gujarat Cricket Association and serves as the venue for domestic and international cricket matches.[1][14] It is one of the world's premier cricket stadiums.[15] The Narendra Modi stadium stands on the same plot where the Sardar Patel Stadium was present from 1982 to 2015, until its demolition,[8] and renovation in 2006.[16] It served as the main venue of domestic and international cricket in the city till 2015. It hosted some matches during the 1987, 1996, and 2011 ICC World Cups.[17][18][19] The Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) scrapped the Sardar Patel Stadium in 2015 to build a state of the art and the world's biggest cricket stadium. The Narendra Modi stadium is designed by Australia's design firm Populous and built by Larsen and Toubro. It took 5 years to build and an estimated cost of ₹800 crore (US$100 million). The arena replaced the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground as the world's largest cricket stadium. The headquarter of the GCA is located in its premises. The Narendra Modi stadium has 4 dressing rooms, 11 center pitches, and 2 practice grounds that can host practice as well as domestic matches etc.[17][8] [20][21] On 24 February 2021, the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA), named this newly built stadium as the Narendra Modi Stadium in honour of the current Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, who was the president of the GCA (2009–2014) and the chief minister of Gujarat (2001–2014). [22] In 2021, the stadium was inaugurated by the president of India, Ram Nath Kovind, in an event he presided over.[23] It was first opened to the public in 2020 amid the Namaste Trump event, organized for president of the United States Donald Trump.[23] On 24 February 2021, the Narendra Modi stadium hosted its first Test match, when home side India played against England, it was also its first ever day-night test game.[24][20] On 29 September 2022, the opening ceremony of the 36th National games was held in the stadium.[25][26] The arena hosted the final match of the 2023 ICC World Cup on 19 November.[27] History[edit] 1982–2006 (Early years)[edit] Formerly known as the Gujarat Stadium, the ground was renamed in tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel,[citation needed] India's first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. Before the Sardar Patel Stadium, international cricket matches in the city were played at the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation's stadium of the same name (Sardar Patel Stadium) in the Navrangpura area. In 1982, the Government of Gujarat donated a 400,000-square-metre (100-acre) stretch of land on the banks of the Sabarmati River to build a new stadium. The construction of the Sardar Patel Stadium was completed in nine months.[4] Since then, all International cricket fixtures for the city are hosted here. In the 1984-85 Australia India series, Sardar Patel Stadium hosted its first ODI, in which India was lost. At the arena Sunil Gavaskar became the first ever batter to score 10,000 runs in the Test cricket, he did the feat against Pakistan in their 1987 tour.[28] In 1983, Kapil Dev took a nine-wicket haul against the West Indies in 1983, and claimed his 432nd Test wicket at the stadium to become the highest wicket-taker in the world in 1995, which broke Sir Richard Hadlee's previous record.[29] In 1996, the ground hosted a low-scoring Test match against South Africa, where the visitors lost 105–170.[citation needed] The Sardar Patel Stadium has hosted games whenever India has hosted the Cricket World Cup, including the first match of the 1996 World Cup between England and New Zealand. However, while the stadium hosted only one game each in 1987 and 1996 WC. In 1996 South Africa (SA) tour of India, in the tour's opening match, they needed 170 runs to win, India's fast bowler Javagal Srinath did incredible performance by taking 6 wickets by spending just 21 runs and led his side to victory.[21] 2006–2015[edit] Sardar Patel Stadium (before reconstruction) The stadium became a focal venue of ICC Champions Trophy in 2006 and hosted five of the 15 games played. In order to host the tournament, the stadium was renovated to add three new pitches and a new outfield. Floodlights and covered stands were introduced at the stadium as a part of the renovation program.[citation needed] In 2010's New Zealand tour of India, 1st Test of the series was held at the venue in which Kane Williamson scored hundred on his Test debut.[21] It hosted three games in the 2011 World Cup, including the quarter-finals between Australia- India. Sachin Tendulkar became the first cricketer to score 18,000 runs in ODIs.[when?][citation needed] 2015–2020 (construction of new stadium)[edit] The Stadium during Namaste Trump event. US President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Narendra Modi Stadium, 24 February 2020. In October 2015, the stadium was demolished for reconstruction, though some media referred to it as a renovation. The total cost of reconstruction was estimated to be ₹700 crores (₹7 billion (US$88 million)).[30][31] However, the final cost was reported at ₹800 crore (US$100 million). The redevelopment, originally planned to be completed in 2019, finished in February 2020. Conception[edit] The idea to build the new stadium was reportedly proposed by Narendra Modi, the president of the Gujarat Cricket Association and the Chief Minister Gujarat at the time it was his dream project.[21] Shortly before Modi moved to Delhi after becoming the Prime Minister of India, there were discussions about minor upgrades to the stadium and development of the structure at the pavilion end. Modi asked the officials to build a new larger stadium instead of minor renovation work.[32] Bids[edit] After starting demolition work at the end of 2015, the GCA issued a request for tender on 1 January 2016 in The Times of India and The Indian Express newspapers. Nine bidders showed interest and purchased the tender documents, out of which three submitted Technical and Financial bids on time; they were the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, Nagarjuna Construction Company, and Larsen & Toubro. A Tender Commercial Committee (TCC) of nine experts was formed to evaluate tenders. Additionally, STUP Consultants, a Civil Engineering consultancy firm based in Mumbai, was appointed as the Project Management Consultant to evaluate proposals and technical details of each bid working with the TCC.[33] Each of the three bidders presented their designs, models, and technical details of their concepts & designs. Because of the sheer size and complexity of the project, the bidders were evaluated on multiple parameters like efficiency, resources, the time frame of completion, ease of implementation etc. The bidders were ranked and weighted on all of the parameters.[citation needed] Bids Submitted for Sardar Patel's Reconstruction Bidder Bid Evaluation Notes Larsen & Toubro ₹677.19 crore (US$85 million) Lowest-1 (L1) Winning bid.
