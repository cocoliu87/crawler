Award International Booker Prize Inaugural winner Ismail Kadare Awarded for Best book in English or in English translation Country United Kingdom Presented by Booker Prize Foundation Reward(s) £50,000 First awarded 2005; 18 years ago (2005) Website thebookerprizes.com/the-international-booker-prize The International Booker Prize (formerly known as the Man Booker International Prize) is an international literary award hosted in the United Kingdom. The introduction of the International Prize to complement the Man Booker Prize was announced in June 2004.[1] Sponsored by the Man Group, from 2005 until 2015 the award was given every two years to a living author of any nationality for a body of work published in English or generally available in English translation.[2] It rewarded one author's "continued creativity, development and overall contribution to fiction on the world stage",[3] and was a recognition of the writer's body of work rather than any one title. Since 2016, the award has been given annually to a single book translated into English and published in the United Kingdom or Ireland, with a £50,000 prize for the winning title, shared equally between author and translator.[4][5] Crankstart, the charitable foundation of Sir Michael Moritz and his wife, Harriet Heyman began supporting The Booker Prizes on 1 June 2019. From this date, the prizes were known as The Booker Prize and The International Booker Prize. Of their support for The Booker Prize Foundation and the prizes, Moritz commented: "Neither of us can imagine a day where we don’t spend time reading a book. The Booker Prizes are ways of spreading the word about the insights, discoveries, pleasures and joy that spring from great fiction". History[edit] Pre-2016[edit] Whereas the Man Booker Prize was open only to writers from the Commonwealth, Ireland, and Zimbabwe, the International Prize was open to all nationalities who had work available in English including translations.[6] The award was worth £60,000 and given every two years to a living author's entire body of literature, similar to the Nobel Prize for Literature.[3] The Man Booker International Prize also allowed for a separate award for translation. If applicable, the winning author could choose their translators to receive a prize sum of £15,000.[7] The 2005 inaugural winner of the prize was Albanian writer Ismail Kadare. Praising its concerted judgement, the journalist Hephzibah Anderson noted that the Man Booker International Prize was "fast becoming the more significant award, appearing an ever more competent alternative to the Nobel".[8] Year Author Country Translator Language Ref. 2005 Ismail Kadare Albania N/A Albanian [9] 2007 Chinua Achebe Nigeria N/A English [10] 2009 Alice Munro Canada N/A English [11] 2011 Philip Roth United States N/A English [12] 2013 Lydia Davis United States N/A English [13] 2015 László Krasznahorkai Hungary George Szirtes and Ottilie Mulzet Hungarian [14] 2016 onwards[edit] In July 2015 it was announced that the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize would be disbanded.[4] The prize money from that award would be folded into the Man Booker International Prize, which would henceforth act similarly to the Independent prize: awarding an annual book of fiction translated into English, with the £50,000 prize split between author and translator.[15] Each shortlisted author and translator receives £2,500.[16] Its aim is to encourage publishing and reading of quality works in translation and to highlight the work of translators. Judges select a longlist of 12 or 13 books in March (“the Booker Dozen”), followed by a shortlist of six in April,[17] with the winner announced in May.[18] Year Author Country Translator Country Work Language Ref. 2016 Han Kang South Korea Deborah Smith United Kingdom The Vegetarian 채식주의자 Korean [19] 2017 David Grossman Israel Jessica Cohen Israel/UK/US A Horse Walks Into a Bar סוס אחד נכנס לבר‎ Hebrew [20] 2018 Olga Tokarczuk Poland Jennifer Croft United States Flights Bieguni Polish [21] 2019 Jokha al-Harthi Oman Marilyn Booth United States Celestial Bodies سـيّـدات الـقـمـر، Arabic [22] 2020 Marieke Lucas Rijneveld Netherlands Michele Hutchison United Kingdom The Discomfort of Evening De avond is ongemak Dutch [23] 2021 David Diop France Anna Moschovakis United States At Night All Blood Is Black Frère d'âme French [24] 2022 Geetanjali Shree India Daisy Rockwell United States Tomb of Sand रेत समाधि[25] Hindi [26][27] 2023 Georgi Gospodinov Bulgaria Angela Rodel United Kingdom/ United States Time Shelter Времеубежище Bulgarian [28] Nominations 2005-2015[edit] 2005[edit] The inaugural Man Booker International Prize was judged by John Carey (Chair), Alberto Manguel and Azar Nafisi.[29] The nominees were announced on 2 June 2005 at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.[3] Albanian novelist Ismail Kadare was named the inaugural International Prize winner in 2005.[29] Head judge, Professor John Carey said Kadare is "a universal writer in the tradition of storytelling that goes back to Homer."[29] Kadare said he was "deeply honoured" at being awarded the prize.[29] Kadare was also able to select a translator to receive an additional prize of £15,000.[29] The writer received his award in Edinburgh on 27 June.[29] Winner Ismail Kadare Nominees Margaret Atwood (Canada) Saul Bellow (US) Gabriel García Márquez (Colombia) Günter Grass (Germany) Ismail Kadare (Albania) Milan Kundera (Czech Republic) Stanisław Lem (Poland) Doris Lessing (UK) Ian McEwan (UK) Naguib Mahfouz (Egypt) Tomas Eloy Martinez (Argentina) Kenzaburō Ōe (Japan) Cynthia Ozick (US) Philip Roth (US) Muriel Spark (UK) Antonio Tabucchi (Italy) John Updike (US) A.B.

Any writer has to gawk when reading her because her work is very subtle and precise. Her thoughtfulness about every subject is so concentrated."[31] Munro, who said she was "totally amazed and delighted" at her win, received the award at Trinity College Dublin on 25 June.[2][31] Winner Alice Munro Nominees Peter Carey (Australia) Evan S.
