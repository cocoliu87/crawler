Abdelrahim's political influence grew as he became the RSF's deputy leader in 2018, establishing strong ties within the Bashir regime. He played a role in the killing of the protesters during the 2019 protests. Abdelrahim, born in South Darfur in the early 1970s, is the brother of Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, the commander of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Abdelrahim initially served in the border guards, rising to colonel when the RSF was established in 2013. Alongside his military career, the Dagalo family ventured into commercial activities, including mining and gold prospecting, notably with Al-Junaid Company. In 2023, as the RSF clashed with Sudan's army, he faced international sanctions for alleged human rights abuses. Abdelrahim defended himself, claiming the sanctions were unjust, while the US stressed the need for accountability. Biography[edit] Abdelrahim Hamdan Dagalo, born in South Darfur in the early 1970s, hails from the Mahamid clan of the Arab Bedouin Rizeigat tribe,[1] known for trade and herding. He is the brother of Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, the commander of Rapid Support Forces (RSF).[2] Abdelrahim initially served in the border guards, composed mainly of Arab tribes, used by the former President Omar al-Bashir's regime in the Darfur conflict. He rose to the rank of first sergeant and later became a colonel when the RSF was established in 2013.[1] Parallel to his military career, the Dagalo family engaged in extensive commercial activities, founding mining and gold prospecting firms, notably Al-Junaid Company, with operations spanning Khartoum, Darfur, and other locations in Sudan.[1][3] Abdelrahim's political influence grew after becoming the deputy leader of the RSF in 2018.[4][3] He built strong relationships within the Bashir regime, particularly with security leaders, enhancing the RSF's authority. During the 2018 protests, Abdelrahim initially played a role in protecting demonstrators and contributed to the downfall of the Bashir regime, but he is accused of ordering the Khartoum massacre at the General Command sit-in in June 2019.[1][5] 2023 Sudan war[edit] The conflict emerged four years after the ousting of President Omar Al-Bashir, stemming from tensions between the army and RSF, which jointly staged a coup in 2021. Sudan's military ruler, General Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan, recently issued a decree to dissolve the RSF, a move contested by Hemedti.[4] After the RSF clashed with the Sudanese army in April 2023, Abdelrahim's videos circulated, confirming his leadership role. He left Sudan, traveling through Darfur, Chad, and Kenya.[1] In September 2023, Abdelrahim Dagalo has faced international sanctions due to his alleged connection to human rights abuses and other issues in Sudan during war in Sudan.[6][7] The sanctions against Dagalo come amid ongoing conflict between the RSF and Sudan's army, particularly in West Darfur, where the RSF and allied militias are accused of violence.[4][8] These sanctions are primarily in response to alleged human rights abuses associated with Abdelrahim Dagalo and his role in the RSF, as well as his connection to businesses, such as a gold mining company, which have also faced sanctions.[4] These sanctions followed a decision by Sudan's leader, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, to dissolve the RSF, revoke its independence, and allow legal prosecution for its members.[1][9] Dagalo stated that the sanctions were unfair and lacked a clear investigation.[10] US Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, defended the sanctions, emphasising the need for justice and accountability for atrocities committed against the Sudanese people.[4][11] Dagalo also claimed that the RSF had acquired significant stores of weapons and supplies that could last for two decades. Meanwhile, Sudan faces a humanitarian crisis, with millions of people in need of assistance, and a large number of refugees fleeing to neighbouring countries, including Chad, Central African Republic, Egypt, Ethiopia, and South Sudan. The United Nations has appealed for substantial funding to address the humanitarian needs in Sudan, but it has only secured a fraction of the required amount to date.[4] References[edit] ^ a b c d e f "طالته أولى العقوبات الأميركية بعد اندلاع الحرب.. عبد الرحيم دقلو نائب قائد قوات الدعم السريع". www.aljazeera.net (in Arabic).
