Third Sánchez government formed. Attempts to form a government in Spain followed the Spanish general election of 23 July 2023, which failed to deliver an overall majority for any political party. As a result, the previous cabinet headed by Pedro Sánchez was formed to remain in a caretaker capacity until the election of a new government. The election failed to provide a majority for either the left-wing bloc, comprising the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) and Sumar, with the support of the Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC), EH Bildu, the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), and the Galician Nationalist Bloc (BNG), or the right-wing bloc, comprising the People's Party (PP), Vox, the Navarrese People's Union (UPN), and Canarian Coalition (CCa). As a result, Together for Catalonia (Junts) was left as the kingmaker in negotiations. The unexpectedly good result for Sánchez's PSOE and the underperformance of the PP-led right-wing bloc triggered speculation over the future of PP leader Alberto Núñez Feijóo. Following weeks of political tensions, which saw Sánchez accepting an amnesty law for Catalan separatist politicians convicted or investigated for events related to the 2017–2018 Spanish constitutional crisis and the 2019–2020 Catalan protests, he was able to secure the support of Sumar, ERC, Junts, EH Bildu, PNV, BNG and CCa to be re-elected as prime minister by an absolute majority on 16 November 2023; the first time since 2011 that a repeat election was not needed, as well as the first time since that date that a candidate was elected in the first ballot of investiture. Sánchez's re-election and amnesty law proposal sparked protests. Legal provisions The procedure for government formation in Spain was outlined in Article 99 of the 1978 Constitution: 1. After renewal of the Congress of Deputies, and in other cases provided under the Constitution, the King, after consultation with the representatives appointed by the political groups with Parliamentary representation, and through the Speaker of Congress, shall nominate a candidate for President of the Government. 2. The candidate nominate [sic] in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing paragraph shall submit to the Congress of Deputies the political programme of the Government that he intends to form and shall seek the confidence of the Houses. 3. If the Congress of Deputies, by vote of the absolute majority of its members, invests said candidate with its confidence, the King shall appoint him President. If an absolute majority is not obtained, the same proposal shall be submitted for a new vote forty-eight hours after the previous vote, and it shall be considered that confidence has been secured if it passes by a simple majority. 4. If, after this vote, confidence for the investiture has not been obtained, successive proposals shall be voted upon in the manner provided in the foregoing paragraphs. 5. If within two months after the first vote for investiture no candidate has obtained the confidence of Congress, the King shall dissolve Congress and call new elections, following endorsement by the Speaker of Congress. — Article 99 of the Spanish Constitution.[1] Post-2023 election developments Initial positions Congress of Deputies resulting from the 23 July 2023 general election Ahead of the election, opinion polls predicted a majority for the People's Party (PP) and Vox. When this failed to materialize,[2][3] both the PP and the ruling Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) claimed the right to form a government.[4][5][6] The possible outcomes discussed following the election were:[7] An alliance of PP, Vox and the Navarrese People's Union (UPN), comprising 171 seats. A PSOE–Sumar coalition with support from the Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC), EH Bildu, the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) and the Galician Nationalist Bloc (BNG), comprising 171 seats. Parliamentary deadlock lasting for two months from a first failed investiture ballot, leading to a new general election to be held towards the end of 2023 or in early 2024. The Canarian Coalition (CCa) was seen as a possible part of either bloc, depending on negotiations. Other possible solutions, such as a grand coalition or the abstention of PP or PSOE in the other's investiture, were seen as unfeasible. As a result, Together for Catalonia (Junts), led by the fugitive former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, was widely regarded as the kingmaker, with both blocs needing their seven seats to form a government, likely in exchange for further concessions on Catalan independence.[8][9][10] Míriam Nogueras, the Congress spokeswoman for Junts, said that her party "was not born to stabilise the Spanish State, but so that Catalonia may be an independent country", adding that her party's vote for Sánchez's investiture would not be given for free.[11] Feijóo acknowledged his difficulty in forming a parliamentary majority, but expressed his intention to seek investiture nonetheless if tasked by the King to form a government.[12][13][14] Having previously called for an end to sanchismo (a derogatory reference to Sánchez's government work), the PP then asked PSOE to allow Feijóo's investiture, as they had done for Mariano Rajoy during the previous government formation process in 2016.[15][16] PSOE promptly rejected this request as impossible after "years of insults", and described it as an attempt by Feijóo to "cover up his failure" by pretending he could command sufficient support for his investiture.[17] Feijóo warned of the breakup of Spain if Sánchez was confirmed as prime minister with the support of pro-independence parties.[18] On 24 July, CCa spokeswoman Ana Oramas expressed her party's refusal to support a "ghost government" of Feijóo, stating that "there is no possibility that Feijóo will be prime minister".[19] This rejection was echoed hours later by Andoni Ortuzar, the president of the PNV, which refused even to enter talks with the PP.[20] Vox stated on 26 July that they could enable Feijóo's investiture "if he could convince a couple of PSOE's deputies" to vote for him, while warning that they would not give the "patriotic vote" of their 33 deputies for free.[21][22] On 25 July, Arnaldo Otegi, the leader of EH Bildu, announced that his party's six deputies would vote for Sánchez and the PSOE during the investiture vote.[23] ERC said it was favourable to Sánchez's investiture, pending a vote among its membership,[24] while the BNG announced it could vote for Sánchez to avoid a right-wing government, but without granting him a "blank cheque".[25] Feijóo's unlikely alliance The PP's result in the election—well below expectations of reaching above 150 or 160 seats—triggered criticism of Feijóo's performance as party leader.[26][27][28] During election night, party supporters interrupted Feijóo's hastily reworked victory speech with chants of "Ayuso, Ayuso!", in reference to Isabel Díaz Ayuso, the Madrilenian president, who some within the party and the Spanish right-wing saw as a possible successor as PP leader.[29] PP leader Feijóo attempted unsuccessfully to convince Sánchez's PSOE to allow him to govern as the candidate of "the most voted political force" (pictured, both men in April 2022). Former Madrilenian president Esperanza Aguirre said during an interview that the election result was attributable to Feijóo's strategy of "seeking to reach out to the PSOE rather than governing with Vox", and commented that Ayuso was the future of the party and of Spain.[30] Ayuso herself acknowledged on 26 July that she had received messages asking her "to take a step forward", but said she was not thinking of challenging Feijóo for the party leadership. "It cannot be that on Thursday we are giving him our support and applauding him [at a rally], and now throwing him off a bridge", she said.[31][32][33] However, she warned Feijóo against seeking an agreement with the PSOE to allow his investiture, commenting that "You cannot reach a deal with the disaster."[34] On 27 July, party secretary-general Cuca Gamarra criticized Aguirre's remarks as outside the party's unity and discourse.[35] Some commentators voiced doubts over whether Feijóo would be willing or able to remain in opposition in the event that Sánchez was able to secure a second term in office.[36][37] Following the counting of the expat vote, one seat in Madrid was flipped from PSOE to PP, meaning that Sánchez's investiture would require an affirmative vote from Junts, not just an abstention. The PP then U-turned on its previous hardline stance towards Junts on 29 July, expressing willingness to engage in talks with Puigdemont's party "within the Constitution's framework" in order to invest Feijóo as prime minister,[38][39] though this was later ruled out by Gamarra.[40] That same day, Puigdemont tweeted that his party would not be convinced by "political blackmail", and saw only three possibilities out of the deadlock: Junts voting in favour of Sánchez, the PSOE allowing Feijóo's investiture, or a repeat election.[41] Sánchez and the PSOE were said to be in no hurry to secure his investiture, instead allowing Junts time to "reflect" on their options as Feijóo exhausted himself looking for support ahead of a failed investiture.[42][43] On 30 July, Feijóo sent an official letter to Sánchez, softening the tone his party had maintained against Sánchez's government for years, and asking for a meeting the following week to negotiate a solution that allowe contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 67 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/2023_Spanish_government_formation responseCode 3 200
