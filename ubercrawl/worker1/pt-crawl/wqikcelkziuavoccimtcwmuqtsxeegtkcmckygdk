wqikcelkziuavoccimtcwmuqtsxeegtkcmckygdk length 6 103837 page 10013 The "Today's Featured Article" (TFA) section first appeared on the main page on February 22, 2004, featuring the article Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Rather than the full article being displayed on the main page, a summary (often described as a "blurb") appears, with a link to the full article appearing in bold. To start with, the rotation of TFAs was done by updating {{Feature}}. The selection did not change promptly at midnight UTC as it now does, and sometimes TFAs would appear for more or less than 24 hours. The system of using daily templates, prepared in advance and automatically transcluded onto the main page, began on August 7, 2004. Since then, things have been a little more regular. The general rules for the TFA section are these: only featured articles appear; there is only one TFA per day; each one is displayed for 24 hours; and only one image accompanies the blurb. Until a change in early 2017, there was also an additional rule that no FA could appear more than once as TFA. Most of the time the rules have been followed ... This is a list of times when something a bit different, intentionally or otherwise, has happened in the TFA section.

This is the only time so far that two TFAs have appeared at the same time with separate blurbs. Some tweaks were made to randomize whether McCain or Obama appeared at the top of the TFA box. On October 31, 2010, Grace Sherwood appeared until 12:28 UTC, at which point it was replaced by Tropical Storm Chantal (2001) because of copyvio/plagiarism concerns. Grace Sherwood was demoted from FA status on December 12, 2010, re-promoted to FA status on September 9, 2013 and re-appeared as TFA on July 10, 2017. On February 9, 2012, Frederick Russell Burnham appeared until 17:27 UTC, at which point it was replaced by Hurricane Nate (2005) because of similar concerns. Frederick Russell Burnham was demoted from FA status on July 12, 2012. On February 4, 2021, Nine Inch Nails live performances was replaced by a re-run of Pacific Swift due to concerns about the article's sourcing and overall quality. On February 14, 2021, Heaven Upside Down was replaced by M113 armoured personnel carriers in Australian service due to concerns about tone deafness following sexual abuse allegations against Marilyn Manson. On September 14, 2023, Lisa Nowak was replaced by Love Story (Taylor Swift song) because it was felt inappropriate for the main page. Love Story remained as TFA for the following day. The ones when multiple featured articles ran in the same blurb[edit] On March 25, 2013, three related featured articles (Blockhaus d'Éperlecques, La Coupole and the Fortress of Mimoyecques) appeared in the same blurb. The coding of the main page was amended to make the section header plural for the day. On September 26, 2013, identical twin brothers Henrik Sedin and Daniel Sedin (born September 26, 1980) appeared in the same blurb. On April 12, 2014, the constellations Triangulum and Triangulum Australe shared the TFA blurb. Two subpages were used to randomise which one appeared first in the blurb. On August 16, 2015, the constellations Corona Borealis and Corona Australis shared the TFA blurb. For September 7, 2015, two Commonwealth Battle of Britain pilots – Caesar Hull (Southern Rhodesia) and Paterson Hughes (Australia), both killed over London on that date in 1940 – shared the TFA blurb. The ones with featured articles that have appeared twice[edit] See also: Category:Featured articles that have appeared on the main page twice Barack Obama's article appeared on August 18, 2004 and was repeated on November 4, 2008 (to mark the 2008 US Presidential election, as noted above). The archived discussion is here. In January 2012, Wikipedia was suspended for 24 hours as part of a co-ordinated protest against the US Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA). The English Wikipedia blackout began at midnight Eastern Time (05:00 UTC) on January 18. One article, Nick Drake, was TFA either side of the blackout on January 18 (5 hours) and on January 19 (19 hours). The article was TFA for a total of 24 hours but this was spread across two days. (See this discussion.) Transit of Venus appeared on May 7, 2005 and June 5, 2012; the second appearance marked the last transit of Venus in the 21st century, the next one not occurring until 10–11 December 2117. Gough Whitlam appeared on March 25, 2004 and November 5, 2014; the second appearance marked Whitlam's memorial service after his death in October 2014 at the age of 98. Pluto first appeared on October 7, 2007, and again on July 14, 2015 to mark the visit to Pluto of the New Horizons space probe. A discussion in 2017 relaxed the rule about TFAs appearing for a second time. Following this, Rosetta Stone (which had first appeared on September 14, 2010) was re-featured on March 18, 2017. The ones with something other than a featured article in the TFA slot[edit] For Wikipedia's 10th birthday, on January 15, 2011, the TFA slot displayed a featured list (Moons of Saturn), a featured topic (Wikipedia:Featured topics/Guadalcanal Campaign) and a featured sound (File:01 - Vivaldi Spring mvt 1 Allegro - John Harrison violin.ogg) On April 1, 2005, User:Bishonen/European toilet paper holder appeared as the TFA (one of the options that had been supported in a long discussion about the options) – but only for one minute before the admin changing the TFA self-reverted. The one when TFA was late[edit] On November 26, 2011, no TFA had been scheduled by Raul654 (FA director) or Dabomb87 (his TFA delegate). After some discussion at Talk:Main Page and 22 minutes of blankness, Wehwalt took a non-specific date nomination from WP:TFAR and scheduled it. An emergency list of pre-prepared blurbs is now kept, in case the TFA coordinators fail to schedule something. The one with the shortest blurb[edit] On April 1, 2013, the hook for the featured article consisted of simply the character "?" (albeit a very large "?"), referring to the Indonesian film ?. The ones with the most votes[edit] History of Gibraltar prompted a vigorous discussion at the TFA requests pages when it was nominated for July 13, 2013, but the discussion was closed with what was at the time the most votes in support that anyone can remember (31–4 in favor of running it). Fuck also prompted another lively discussion at TFAR before it was scheduled for March 1, 2014. The discussion set a new record for the most votes (52–25 in support of running it, excluding neutrals and votes conditional on its appearance on a specifically relevant date rather than a non-specific date). If discussions are measured by page size rather than number of votes or !votes, then we get: Wikipedia:Today's featured article/requests/Fuck: Word Taboo and Protecting Our First Amendment Liberties (196,298 bytes) Wikipedia:Today's featured article/requests/Fuck (film) (128,663 bytes) Wikipedia:Today's featured article/requests/History of Gibraltar (60,339 bytes) Wikipedia:Today's featured article/requests/Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo (30,007 bytes covering discussions in 2011 and 2012) The ones with the most points[edit] For many years, until April 2014, the requests page used a points system to help indicate which articles were more deserving of appearing as TFA in the event of competition for the same date or similar articles being nominated. (Final version of the system) Factors used included: how long it had been since the article's promotion (with articles that had been promoted 1 or 2+ years ago gaining points); whether the article was from a section at WP:FA with <50 articles; whether it was a "vital article"; whether similar articles had run in the recent past (which could mean bonuses or penalties, depending on timing); whether it would be the author's first TFA; and to mark anniversaries (with various bonus points for multiples of 10 or 25). The highest score under this system, as far as anyone can remember, was eleven points: Richard Nixon (at Wikipedia:Today's featured article/requests/Richard Nixon): centennial of birth (6), level 4 vital article (4), and promoted over one year previously (1); Richard Wagner (at Wikipedia:Today's featured article/requests/Richard Wagner): bicentenary of birth (6), level 4 vital article (4), and nominator's first TFA appearance (1). John Calvin (nomination in history) Quincentennial of birth (6) level 4 vital article (4), and promoted over one year previously (1); Had the points system still been in operation, Wikipedia:Today's featured article/requests/John A. Macdonald would have set a new record with twelve points: bicentenary of birth (6), level 4 vital article (4) and promoted over two years previously (2). The ones with the most pictures in the blurb[edit] Middle Ages, which was TFA on September 12, 2013, had not one but five accompanying images, each illustrating different aspects of the topic. Which image a reader saw at any particular time was governed by {{random subpage}}, assisted by the main page's being purged every 15 minutes by a bot. Metalloid, which was TFA for October 4, 2014, had six different images, one for each o contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 79 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Wikipedia:Today%27s_featured_article_oddities responseCode 3 200
