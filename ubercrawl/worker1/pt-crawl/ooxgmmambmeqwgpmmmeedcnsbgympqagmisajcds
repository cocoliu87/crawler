Ukraine also claimed that Russian paratroopers have fled the battlefield.[3] 30 August Ukraine claimed to have used decoy HIMARS units made out of wood, which could have explained Russian claims of having destroyed multiple HIMARS systems. Ukrainian officials claimed to have decoyed 10 Russian 3M-54 Kalibr cruise missiles alone. One US diplomat noted that Russian sources claimed to have destroyed more HIMARS than the US has sent. Another US Pentagon official confirmed no HIMARS had been destroyed yet.[4] Images from Maxar Technologies show holes in the roof of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. IAEA chief Rafael Grossi has confirmed that the support and assistance mission is "now on its way".[5] 31 August Russia pulled its fighter jets out of Crimea and increased its surface-to-air missiles to defend against future shelling.[6] Russia stopped gas supplies to Germany via Nord Stream 1 for three days to perform repairs.[7] According to the UK MoD, Ukrainian forces pushed the Russian "front line back some distance in places", due to Ukraine "exploiting relatively thinly held Russian defenses".[8] Ukraine released footage of a MiG-29 firing an AGM-88 HARM, which had to be somehow integrated into the MiG-29's analogue displays.[9] September 2022 1 September IAEA inspectors at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant IAEA inspectors arrived at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.[10] Ravil Maganov, the chairman of Lukoil, died in disputed circumstances. According to Interfax, he "fell out of a window of the Central Clinical Hospital" and "died from his injuries". Lukoil was one of the few Russian companies to oppose the war in Ukraine, calling for an "immediate" end to the war. Maganov's death is the latest mysterious death of current or former Russian businessmen since the war began.[11] 2 September Norwegian state-owned oil company Equinor exited the last of their joint ventures in Russia following the February invasion by withdrawing from the joint venture with Lukoil and exiting the Kharyaga project.[12] Ukraine arrested a woman in the Dnipropetrovsk region who was accused of sending the details of her husband's unit and other military information to Russian forces which was then used to the advantage of Russian military action.[13] Russian support for the war in Ukraine remained stable despite it dragging on for six months. The greatest disagreement was on whether to continue the war or proceed to negotiations.[14] Ukraine was searching the UK for foundries to make 155 mm ammunition due to Western stockpiles running low. BAE systems can increase production however Ukrainian officials are looking for other manufacturers. The US had sent "806,000" of these rounds to Ukraine and replacing them could take as long as "18 months".[15] 3 September Gazprom maintained its shutdown of Nord Stream 1 without providing a date for restarting the flow of gas. Gazprom cited Western sanctions as the reason that it cannot fix the "malfunction" in the pipe, which is claimed to be a leak. The European Union called it an economic weapon.[16] According to the UK MoD, since 29 August Ukrainian forces had gained the element of surprise due to mistakes made by Russian commanders and logistical problems Russian forces face. There were three main thrusts by Ukrainian forces into Kherson Oblast. Ukraine also destroyed pontoon bridges used by Russian forces.[17][18] 4 September The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant was cut from its main power line, with only a reserve line operational, which was supplying power to the grid. Only one of the six reactors remained operational.[19] Russia blamed this on an alleged Ukrainian attempt to retake the plant.[20] After not being used for several months Ukraine resumed its use of Bayraktar TB2 drones. Ukraine started putting footage from these online again after no new footage in the last two months. This was credited to the use of HARM missiles and their impact on Russian air defences.[21] 6 September Artem Bardin, a Russian-installed official in Berdyansk, was seriously injured in a bomb attack.[22] Sky News reported that Russia bought rockets from North Korea to assist with the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[23] 7 September Ukraine's SBU Alpha Group in Kupiansk during the Kharkiv counteroffensive, early September 2022 The US was looking to double its production of 155 mm shells due to a need to replenish US stocks as well as supply Ukrainian needs. The Pentagon said it was aiming to increase the number of HIMARS built each month to 12.[24] 9 September Ukrainian forces retook parts of Kharkiv Oblast.[25] 10 September As part of a major counteroffensive, Ukrainian forces recaptured Kupiansk and Izium; according to the UK Ministry of Defence, Russian defences in the Kharkiv region were "likely taken by surprise".[26] By late afternoon, Ukrainian troops were reported to have reached Lysychansk in Luhansk Oblast.[27][non-primary source needed][28][non-primary source needed] The Russian Ministry of Defence spokesperson Igor Konashenkov responded to these developments by claiming that Russian forces in the Balakliya and Izyum area would "regroup" in the Donetsk area "in order to achieve the stated goals of the special military operation to liberate Donbas". Ukrainian President Zelenskyy said that Ukraine has recaptured 2,000 square kilometres (770 sq mi) since the start of the counteroffensive.[29] 11 September The Russian Ministry of Defense published a map which confirmed that Russian forces in Kharkiv region had retreated to the east bank of the Oskol river.[30] The settlements of Kozachya Lopan,[31] Vovchansk and Lyptsi[32] were confirmed as being under control of Ukrainian forces. By late afternoon, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the formal withdrawal of Russian forces from nearly all of Kharkiv Oblast stating that an "operation to curtail and transfer troops" was un contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 116 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine_(29_August_%E2%80%93_11_November_2022) responseCode 3 200
