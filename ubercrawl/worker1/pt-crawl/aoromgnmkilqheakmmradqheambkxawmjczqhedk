The party's aim is for greater autonomy for the islands but not independence.[7] It has been labeled as centrist[8] and liberal.[9][10] The party governed the Canary Islands from 1993 to 2019; and currently since 2023 under Fernando Clavijo Batlle's leadership. It usually negotiates with the plurality party at the Cortes to form a majority in exchange for resources for the islands. It also governs the local administrations of Tenerife, La Palma, and Fuerteventura, as well as having majority control in some of the town councils on the Canary Islands. History[edit] The coalition was formed in February 1993 from a grouping of five parties (the largest being the Canarian Independent Groups) under one banner[7] and has governed the Canary Islands since 1993,[11] when it replaced the former Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) administration after a motion of no confidence. After entering government, CC obtained power for the regional government to levy its own taxes and a law compensating the islands for their distance from the mainland.[7] The coalition became a single party in 2005.[11] Composition[edit] Party Scope Notes Independent Canarian Centre (CCI) Canaries Nationalist Canarian Initiative (ICAN) Canarian Nationalist Party (PNC) Canarian Independent Groups (AIC) Tenerife Group of Independents (ATI) Tenerife La Palma Group of Independents (API) La Palma Lanzarote Independents Party (PIL) Lanzarote Left in 1994.[12] Independents of Fuerteventura (IF) Fuerteventura Left in 1994.
