Combination of Greek words 'Geo' (The Earth) and 'Graphien' (to describe), literally "earth description") is a field of science devoted to the study of the lands, features, inhabitants, and phenomena of Earth.[1] Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of Earth and its human and natural complexities—not merely where objects are, but also how they have changed and come to be. While geography is specific to Earth, many concepts can be applied more broadly to other celestial bodies in the field of planetary science.[2] Geography has been called "a bridge between natural science and social science disciplines."[3] The first recorded use of the word γεωγραφία was as a title of a book by Greek scholar Eratosthenes (276–194 BC).[1] However, the concepts of geography (such as cartography) date back to the earliest attempts to understand the world spatially, with the earliest example of an attempted world map dating to the 9th century BCE in ancient Babylon.[4] The history of geography as a discipline spans cultures and millennia, being independently developed by multiple groups, and cross-pollinated by trade between these groups. The core concepts of geography consistent between all approaches are a focus on space, place, time, and scale.[5][6][7][8][9][10] Today, geography is an extremely broad discipline with multiple approaches and modalities. There have been multiple attempts to organize the discipline, including the four traditions of geography, and into branches.[11][3][12] Techniques employed can generally be broken down into quantitative[13] and qualitative[14] approaches, with many studies taking mixed-methods approaches.[15] Common techniques include cartography, remote sensing, interviews, and surveys. Fundamentals Geography is a systematic study of the Earth (other celestial bodies are specified, such as "geography of Mars", or given another name, such as areography in the case of Mars), its features, and phenomena that take place on it.[16][17][18] For something to fall into the domain of geography, it generally needs some sort of spatial component that can be placed on a map, such as coordinates, place names, or addresses. This has led to geography being associated with cartography and place names. Although many geographers are trained in toponymy and cartology, this is not their main preoccupation. Geographers study the Earth's spatial and temporal distribution of phenomena, processes, and features as well as the interaction of humans and their environment.[19] Because space and place affect a variety of topics, such as economics, health, climate, plants, and animals, geography is highly interdisciplinary. The interdisciplinary nature of the geographical approach depends on an attentiveness to the relationship between physical and human phenomena and their spatial patterns.[20] Names of places...are not geography...To know by heart a whole gazetteer full of them would not, in itself, constitute anyone a geographer. Geography has higher aims than this: it seeks to classify phenomena (alike of the natural and of the political world, in so far as it treats of the latter), to compare, to generalize, to ascend from effects to causes, and, in doing so, to trace out the laws of nature and to mark their influences upon man. This is 'a description of the world'—that is Geography. In a word, Geography is a Science—a thing not of mere names but of argument and reason, of cause and effect.[21] — William Hughes, 1863 Geography as a discipline can be split broadly into three main branches: human geography, physical geography, and technical geography.[3][22] Human geography largely focuses on the built environment and how humans create, view, manage, and influence space.[22] Physical geography examines the natural environment and how organisms, climate, soil, water, and landforms produce and interact.[23] The difference between these approaches led to the development of integrated geography, which combines physical and human geography and concerns the interactions between the environment and humans.[19] Technical geography involves studying and developing the tools and techniques used by geographers, such as remote sensing, cartography, and geographic information system.[24] Core concepts Space Main article: Space A right-handed three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system used to indicate positions in space. Just as all phenomena exist in time and thus have a history, they also exist in space and have a geography.[25] — United States National Research Council, 1997 For something to exist in the realm of geography, it must be able to be described spatially.[25][26] Thus, space is the most fundamental concept at the foundation of geography.[5][6] The concept is so basic, that geographers often have difficulty defining exactly what it is. Absolute space is the exact site, or spatial coordinates, of objects, persons, places, or phenomena under investigation.[5] We exist in space.[7] Absolute space leads to the view of the world as a photograph, with everything frozen in place when the coordinates were recorded. Today, geographers are trained to remember that the world is not the static image that appears on a map; and instead, the dynamic space where all processes interact and take place.[5][27] Place Main articles: Location, Place identity, and Sense of place Place is one of the most complex and important terms in geography.[7][8][9][10] In human geography, place is the synthesis of the coordinates on the Earth's surface, the activity and use that occurs, has occurred, and will occur at the coordinates, and the meaning ascribed to the space by human individuals and groups.[26][9] This can be extraordinarily complex, as different spaces may have different uses at different times and mean different things to different people. In physical geography, a place includes all of the physical phenomena that occur in space, including the lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere.[10] Places do not exist in a vacuum and instead have complex spatial relationships with each other, and place is concerned how a location is situated in relation to all other locations.[28][29] As a discipline then, the term place in geography includes all spatial phenomena occurring at a location, the diverse uses and meanings humans ascribe to that location, and how that location impacts and is impacted by all other locations on Earth.[9][10] In one of Yi-Fu Tuan's papers, he explains that in his view, geography is the study of Earth as a home for humanity, and thus place and the complex meaning behind the term is central to the discipline of geography.[8] Time Main articles: Time geography and Historical geography Examples of the visual language of time geography: space-time cube, path, prism, bundle, and other concepts. Time is usually thought to be within the domain of history, however, it is of significant concern in the discipline of geography.[30][31][32] In physics, space and time are not separated, and are combined into the concept of spacetime.[33] Geography is subject to the laws of physics, and in studying things that occur in space, time must be considered. Time in geography is more than just the historical record of events that occurred at various discrete coordinates; but also includes modeling the dynamic movement of people, organisms, and things through space.[7] Time facilitates movement through space, ultimately allowing things to flow through a system.[30] The amount of time an individual, or group of people, spends in a place will often shape their attachment and perspective to that place.[7] Time constrains the possible paths that can be taken through space, given a starting point, possible routes, and rate of travel.[34] Visualizing time over space is challenging in terms of cartography, and includes Space-Prism, advanced 3D geovisualizations, and animated maps.[28][34][35][27] Scale Main articles: Scale (geography), Scale (ratio), and Scale (map) A graphical or bar scale. A map would also usually give its scale numerically ("1:50,000", for instance, means that one cm on the map represents 50,000cm of real space, which is 500 meters) Scale in the context of a map is the ratio between a distance measured on the map and the corresponding distance as measured on the ground.[2][36] This concept is fundamental to the discipline of geography, not just cartography, in that pheno contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 44 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Geographic responseCode 3 200
