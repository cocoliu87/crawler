They are named after Jihad Ahmed Jibril, the son of founder Ahmed Jibril, and former head of the brigades, who died in an attack in 2002. Their symbolism is the flag of the PFLP-CG in black and white. History[edit] Originally, they formed the paramilitary branch of the PFLP-CG, founded in 1969 following a split in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) following Jibril's refusal of the Marxization of the PFLP. The Brigades participated in the South Lebanon conflict alongside Hezbollah, the Lebanese National Resistance Front and the Amal Movement against the Israeli armed forces and their collaborators of the South Lebanon Army. At the same time, the PFLP-CG openly allied itself with Hezbollah. They took the name of their leader, Jihad Ahmed Jibril, following the latter's death in 2002. In 2008, the Jihad Jibril Brigades fired rockets at the Israeli town of Netivot.[1] The Brigades train their own weapons and have explosives and missile manufacturers.[2] Although secular in obedience, the Brigades moved closer to Hamas in the 2000s, but moved away from it in the 2010s following the Syrian Civil War.[2] They are active in the Gaza Strip.[2] They are actively participating in the Syrian Civil War alongside the Syrian Ba'athist government, and clashed with the Free Syrian Army during the Battle of Yarmouk Camp,[3] as well as the global terrorist group ISIS. They notably fought in the Yarmouk camp. They also face the pro-rebel Palestinian Islamist group Aknaf Bait al-Maqdis.[4] Around 400 members of the PFLP-CG are believed to have died during the civil war.[5] The Jihad Jibril Brigades actively participate in joint training in the Gaza Strip with other Palestinian factions.[6] They actively cooperate with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad despite their ideological differences.[7] They participate in the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, which provoked the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.[8] References[edit] ^ Jihad Jibril Brigades attack Netivot, 2008 ^ a b c "Report on the Leftist-Turned-Islamist Gaza Terror Organization – The Martyr Jihad Jibril Brigades".
