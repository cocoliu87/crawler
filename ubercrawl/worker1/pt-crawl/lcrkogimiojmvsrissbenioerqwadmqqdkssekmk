The battle began on 15 April 2023, after the RSF captured Khartoum International Airport, several military bases, and the presidential palace, starting an escalating series of clashes. It was initially reported that tensions rose in Khartoum and Merowe on 13 April 2023, when RSF forces mobilized.[12] In response, the SAF issued a statement saying "There is a possibility of confrontation between SAF and RSF forces" introducing fears of a wider conflict.[13] In the evening of 14 April 2023, RSF forces assaulted the Khartoum International Airport, a military base, and the presidential palace. The fighting spread from Khartoum into its suburbs, primarily Omdurman where its bridge on the White Nile was largely captured by the RSF forces.[14] By 28 April, there had been more than 500 civilian deaths in Khartoum, including an Indian citizen, an Iraqi citizen, an Egyptian civilian, and a Sudanese-American man travelling with his family.[15][16] The battle has been marked by gruelling urban warfare.[17][18] Background[edit] Khartoum is the capital and largest city in Sudan, with over a million residents. The Khartoum metropolitan area is made up of three main areas; Omdurman to the northwest, on the west bank of the Nile, with Omdurman being the second most populous city in Sudan, and Khartoum North, colloquially known as Bahri, located north of Khartoum itself. South of Khartoum is the town of Jebel Awliya, where supplies to and from the rest of Sudan, predominantly Port Sudan and El-Obeid, go through. To the north of Omdurman is the town of Karari, where supplies to and from northern Sudan and Egypt go through. Because of Khartoum's central location, the city has often been spared in attacks by rebel groups throughout the War in Darfur, with the exception of the 2008 Omdurman attack, in which the Justice and Equality Movement attempted to overthrow the Omar al-Bashir regime. The attack was the first and only notable attack in Khartoum State throughout the war, which ended in 2020. Many[vague] Janjaweed fighters, a pro-Bashir militia comprised predominantly of Arabs and notorious for their ethnic cleansings of non-Arab civilians in Darfur, joined the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces following the Juba Peace Agreement that ended the War in Darfur in 2020.[19] The RSF is led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemedti.[19] In 2019, popular uprisings against the Bashir regime began across Sudan, especially in Khartoum.[20] The Sudanese government, aided by the RSF, shot at protesters, killing dozens of people over a period of several months in Khartoum and Omdurman.[21][22] The deadliest incident was in Khartoum on 3 June, where Sudanese soldiers and the RSF killed over a hundred civilians protesting the regime.[23] Bashir was eventually overthrown, and a transitional civilian-military administration was put in place with Abdalla Hamdok leading the civilian half and Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. In 2021, Burhan, along with Hemedti, overthrew the civilian administration in the 2021 Sudanese coup d'état, cementing military rule over Sudan. By 2023, tensions between Burhan and Hemedti increased after Burhan's pressure to integrate the RSF into the Sudanese military, whereas Hemedti preferred autonomy for the RSF.[24] On 13 April, rumors spread of RSF fighters mobilizing at bases in Khartoum and Merowe.[12] By 14 April, both groups had tens of thousands of fighters in Khartoum each.[25] These tensions came to a head on 15 April 2023, after RSF fighters attacked civilian and military sites across the nation, including Khartoum and Omdurman.[24] The Khartoum International Airport where the first attacks were reported on 15 April 2023, currently occupied by the RSF forces Outbreak of war[edit] Main article: 2023 Khartoum destruction of aircraft Initial attacks on Khartoum Airport and Omdurman, 15–17 April[edit] In the early hours of the morning of 15 April 2023, the Rapid Support Forces initiated a series of assaults on key installations in Khartoum, including the Khartoum International Airport. During the attack on the airport, the RSF reportedly fired on a Saudia airliner which was arriving at the airport, but no casualties were reported among the aircraft's passengers and crew.[26][27] The RSF also captured the presidential palace, the residence of former Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir, and attacked a military base.[28][29] In the fighting at the Khartoum airport, two civilians were killed.[30] Hemedti claimed that the RSF controlled most of the city's government buildings, but this was disputed by Burhan.[31] Military situation in Khartoum as of April 2023; blue highlights areas of RSF activity RSF fighters stormed Burhan's residence as well on 15 April, attempting to assassinate him. Burhan and his bodyguards fought back, with a bodyguard later stating that Burhan himself picked up an AK-47 and shot at the RSF. While Burhan escaped the fighting safely, over thirty of his bodyguards were killed in the clashes.[32] The same day, several aerial attacks towards the RSF targets were conducted by the SAF. Users on Facebook Live and Twitter documented the Sudanese Air Force flying above the city, and striking the RSF targets.[33] On 16 April, the Armed Forces claimed to have re-captured the presidential palace, a claim disputed by the RSF who posted a video on Twitter of their continued presence in the palace amidst ongoing fighting. The RSF also disputed claims that several other buildings had been captured by the Armed Forces.[34] The Interior Ministry building was also said to have come under RSF occupation.[32] On 17 April, students from Comboni College of Science & Technology were evacuated after fighting reached the campus.[35] That same day, the Forces of Freedom and Change stated that negotiations were no longer going on between Hemedti and Burhan.[36] In a statement, Hemedti claimed to be fighting against Islamists, and championing himself as a leader of democracy.[37] Students at other university students were forced to flee through gates following attacks and clashes at their campuses.[38] At the University of Khartoum, one student, Khalid al-Tageea, was buried on campus after shelling hit and killed him, and it was impossible to transport his body.[39] At the Khartoum Teaching Hospital, one of the largest in the city, the building was besieged by the RSF. It shut down completely on 17 April along with the sister Al-Shaab Teaching Hospital due to RSF shelling hitting and damaging the building.[40] In al-Moallem hospital, residents and staff were forced to flee following RSF attacks on the hospital. Staff alleged the shelling was deliberate.[41] In Bahri's International Hospital, the director took to social media for fuel donations as power had been cut to the neighborhood.[40] By 18 April, 39 of the 59 hospitals in Khartoum were out of service, and the remaining twenty were in Omdurman.[42] On 16 April, General Yassir El Atta announced that all RSF camps in Khartoum were under SAF control, along with Port Sudan, El-Gadarif, and Kosti. This could not be independently verified at the time.[43] However, new RSF camps popped up, such as in the All Saint's Cathedral on 17 April.[44] International incidents and reactions[edit] On 17 April, the Sudanese government announced the closure of Sudan's airspace, initially limited solely to that of Khartoum.[45][46] Aidan O'Hara, the European Union ambassador to Sudan, was assaulted at his Kha contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 59 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Battle_of_Khartoum_(2023) responseCode 3 200
