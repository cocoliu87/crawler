The NCI conducts and supports research, training, health information dissemination, and other activities related to the causes, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer; the supportive care of cancer patients and their families; and cancer survivorship. NCI is the oldest and has the largest budget and research program of the 27 institutes and centers of the NIH ($6.9 billion in 2020).[6] It fulfills the majority of its mission via an extramural program that provides grants for cancer research. Additionally, the National Cancer Institute has intramural research programs in Bethesda, Maryland, and at the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research[7] at Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland. The NCI receives more than US$5 billion in funding each year.[8] The NCI supports a nationwide network of 71 NCI-designated Cancer Centers with a dedicated focus on cancer research and treatment[9] and maintains the National Clinical Trials Network.[10] History[edit] Timeline[edit] An early wooden sign for the National Cancer Institute August 5, 1937: President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed into law the National Cancer Institute Act (Pub. Law 75-244; 50 Stat. 559), which established the National Cancer Institute, as a division of the Public Health Service.[11][12][13][14] 1940: The first issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute was published. 1944: The United States Congress made the NCI an operating division of the National Institutes of Health by its passage of the Public Health Service Act. Congress later amended the Public Health Service Act with the National Cancer Act of 1971, to broaden the scope and responsibilities of the NCI "in order more effectively to carry out the national effort against cancer." 1955: NCI established the Clinical Trials Cooperative Group Program, which included several research networks that conducted cancer clinical research primarily under the sponsorship of NCI. 1957: The first cancer, choriocarcinoma, was cured with chemotherapy at NCI. 1960: NCI began funding government-supported cancer centers. 1971: President Richard Nixon converted the U.S. Army's former biological warfare facilities at Fort Detrick, Maryland, to house research activities on the causes, treatment, and prevention of cancer. 1971: The National Cancer Act of 1971 declares "war on cancer," establishes the National Cancer Advisory Board, and allots additional funding for cancer research. 1975: The Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research opened in Frederick, Maryland, as a Federally Funded Research and Development Center 1993: The NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 encourages NCI to expand its efforts in prostate cancer, breast and other cancers which primarily or solely affected women, and authorized increased appropriations. 1998: Establishes the Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine to study pseudoscientific alternative medicine treatments for cancer 2009: The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided US$10 billion in additional funding for the NIH; the NCI received US$1.3 billion from that amount. 2016: The 21st Century Cures Act increased funding for biomedical research. The "Cancer Moonshot" program promised additional support for cancer research.[15] On October 17, 2017, Norman Sharpless was sworn in as the 15th director of the National Cancer Institute. In April 2019, Sharpless left NCI to serve as the acting Commissioner of Food and Drugs.[16] He returned to the institute in November 2019 as director.[17] Anti-cancer drug investigations[edit] Alkylating agents Cyclophosphamide Chlorambucil (Leukeran) (1957) Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) (1959) Thiotepa (1959) Melphalan (Alkeran) (1959) (IV in 1993) Streptozotocin (Zanosar) (1982) Ifosfamide (Ifex) (1988) Antimetabolites Mercaptopurine (1953) Methotrexate (1953) Thioguanine (1966) Cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) (1969) Floxuridine (FUDR) (1970) Fludarabine phosphate (1991) Pentostatin (1991) Chlorodeoxyadenosine (1992) Plant alkaloids and antibiotics Vincristine Vincristine (Oncovin) (1963) Actinomycin D (Cosmegen) (1964) Mithramycin (Mithracin) (1970) Bleomycin (Blenoxane) (1973) Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) (1974) Mitomycin C (Mutamycin) (1974) L-Asparaginase (Elspar) (1978) Daunomycin (Cerubidine) (1979) VP-16-213 (Etoposide) (1983) VM-26 (Teniposide) (1992) Taxol (Paclitaxel) (1992) Plant flavonoids chrysin quercetin galangin naringenin (1994) Synthetic drugs Carboplatin Hydroxyurea (Hydrea) (1967) Procarbazine (Matulane) (1969) O, P'-DDD (Lysodren, Mitotane) (1970) Dacarbazine (DTIC) (1975) CCNU (Lomustine) (1976) BCNU (Carmustine) (1977) Cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (Cisplatin) (1978) Mitoxantrone (Novantrone) (1988) Carboplatin (Paraplatin) (1989) Levamisole (Ergamisol) (1990) Hexamethylmelamine (Hexalen) (1990) All-trans retinoid acid (Vesanoid) (1995) Porfimer sodium (Photofrin) (1995) Hormones and steroids DES (1950) Prednisone (1953) Fluoxymesterone (Halotestin) (1958) Dromostanolone (Drolban) (1961) Testolactone (Teslac) (1970) Methyl prednisolone Prednisolone Zoladex (1989) Biologicals Alpha interferon (Intron A, Roferon-A) (1986) BCG (TheraCys, TICE) (1990) G-CSF (1991) GM-CSF (1991) Interleukin 2 (Proleukin) (1992) Organization[edit] The NCI is divided into several divisions and centers.[18] Intramural[edit] Center for Cancer Research The CCR includes approximately 250 internal NCI research groups in Frederick and Bethesda.[19] Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics DCEG is made up of eight branches within the Trans-divisional Research Program.[20] Extramural[edit] Division of Cancer Biology DCB oversees approximately 2000 grants per year in the areas of cancer cell biology; cancer immunology, hematology, and etiology; DNA and chromosome aberrations; structural biology and molecular applications; tumor biology and microenvironment; and tumor metastasis.[21] "Special Research Programs" falling under the aegis of the DCB include: Physical Sciences-Oncology Network, Cancer Systems Biology Consortium, Oncology Models Forum, Barrett's Esophagus Translational Research Network, New Approaches to Synthetic Lethality for Mutant KRAS-Dependent Cancers, Molecular and Cellular Characterization of Screen-Detected Lesions, Fusion Oncoproteins in Childhood Cancers, and Cancer Tissue Engineering Collaborative.[22] Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences Division of Cancer Prevention Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis DCTD supports eight research programs: The Biometric Research Program, The Cancer Diagnosis Program, The Cancer Imaging Program, The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, The Developmental Therapeutics Program, The Radiation Research Program, The Translational Research Program, and The Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine.[23] Division of Extramural Activities DEA processes and supports the thousands of grant applications NCI receives each year and compiles reports on the progress of research funded by the NCI's programs.[24] Office of the director[edit] Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology Center for Cancer Genomics CCG was created in 2011 and is responsible for management of The Cancer Genome Atlas and cancer genomics initiatives. Center for Cancer Training Center for Global Health Center for Strategic Scientific Initiatives In the 1990s, the Unconventional Innovation Program was created to integrate interdisciplinary technology research with biological applications. It was reorganized in 2004 as the CSSI.[25] Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities Center for Research Strategy Coordinating Center for Clinical Trials Technology Transfer Center Programs[edit] Further information: Informatics for Consumer Health NCI-designated Cancer Centers[edit] The NCI-designated Cancer Centers are one of the primary arms in the NCI's mission in supporting cancer research. There are currently 71 so-designated centers; 12 clinical cancer centers, 52 comprehensive cancer centers, and 7 basic laboratory cancer centers. NCI supports these centers with grant funding in the form of P30 Cancer Center Support Grants to support shared research resources and interdisciplinary programs. Additionally, faculty at the cancer centers receive approximately 75% of the grant funding awarded by the NCI to individual investigators.[9][26] The NCI cancer centers program was introduced in 1971 with 15 participating institutions.[27] National Clinical Trials Network[edit] The National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) was formed in 2014, from the Cooperative Group program to modernize the existing system to support precision medicine clinical trials. With precision medicine, many patients must be screened to determine eligibility for treatments in development.[citation needed] Lead Academic Participating Sites (LAPS) were chosen at 30 academic institutions for their ability to conduct clinical trials and screen a large number of participants and awarded grants to support the infrastructure and administration required for clinical trials. Most LAPS grant recipients are also NCI-designated cancer centers.[10] NCTN also stores surgical tissue from contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 59 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/National_Cancer_Institute responseCode 3 200
