The Western world as derived from Samuel P. Huntington's 1996 Clash of Civilizations:[1] in light blue are Latin America and the Orthodox World, which are either a part of the West or distinct civilizations intimately related to the West.[2][3] The Western world, also known as the West, primarily refers to various nations and states in the regions of Australasia,[a] Europe,[b] and the Americas.[c][6] The Western world likewise is called the Occident (from Latin occidens 'setting down, sunset, west') in contrast to the Eastern world known as the Orient (from Latin oriens 'origin, sunrise, east'). The West is considered an evolving concept; made up of cultural, political, and economic synergy among diverse groups of people, and not a rigid region with fixed borders and members.[7] Definitions for "Western world" vary according to context and perspectives.[8] Modern-day Western world essentially encompasses the nations and states where civilization or culture is considered Western[9][10][11]—the roots of which some historians have traced back to the Greco-Roman world and Christianity.[12][13] In the Global North–South schism, the West is often correlated with Global North.[14][15] A historic idea of Europe as the geographic West emerged in the fifth century BCE Greece.[16][17][18] A geographical concept of the West started to take shape in the 4th century CE when Constantine–the first Christian Roman emperor divided the Roman Empire between the Greek East and Latin West. The East Roman Empire, later called the Byzantine Empire, continued for a millennium, while the West Roman Empire lasted for only about a century and a half. This caused many people in Western Europe to envy the Byzantine Empire and consider the Christians over there as heretics.[8] In 1054 CE, when the church in Rome excommunicated the patriarch of Byzantium, the politico-religious division between the Western church and Eastern Christian churches culminated in the Great Schism or the East–West Schism.[8][19] Even though friendly relations continued between the two parts of the Christendom for some time, the crusades made the schism definitive with hostility.[20] The West during these crusades tried to capture trade routes to the East and failed, it instead discovered the Americas.[21] In the aftermath of European colonization of these newly discovered lands, an idea of the Western world, as an inheritor of Latin Christendom emerged.[22] The English word "West" was initially meant an adverb for direction. By the Middle Ages, Europeans began to use it to describe Europe. Since the eighteenth century, following European exploration, the word was used to indicate the regions of the world with European settlements.[23][24][25] In contemporary times, countries that are considered to constitute the West vary according to perspective rather than their geographical location. Countries like Australia and New Zealand, located in the Eastern Hemisphere are included in modern definitions of the Western world,[26] as these regions and others like them have been significantly influenced by the British—derived from colonization, and immigration of Europeans—factors that grounded such countries to the West.[27] Despite being located in the Far East, a country like Japan, in some contexts, is considered a part of the West as it aligns with the ideals of Western-style democracy; while a country like Cuba, located in the Western Hemisphere, is argued as not being a part of the West as it aligns with the ideals of communism.[28] Depending on the context and the historical period in question, Russia was sometimes seen as a part of the West, and at other times juxtaposed with it.[29][30][31] Running parallel to the rise of the United States as a great power and the development of communication–transportation technologies "shrinking" the distance between both the Atlantic Ocean shores, the aforementioned country became more prominently featured in the conceptualizations of the West.[29] Between the eighteenth century to the mid-twentieth century, prominent countries in the West such as the United States, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, and New Zealand have been once envisioned as ethnocracies for whites.[32][33][34] Racism is cited to had been a contributing factor in the westerners' colonization of the new world, which today constitutes much of the "geographical" Western world.[35][36] Starting from the late 1960s, certain parts of the Western World have become notable for their diversity.[37][38] The idea of "the West" over the course of time has evolved from a directional concept to a socio-political concept that had been temporalized and rendered as a concept of the future bestowed with notions of progress and modernity.[29] Introduction Western civilized society is considered to have developed from Western culture influenced by many older civilizations of the ancient Near East,[39] such as Canaan,[40][41][42] Minoan Crete, Sumer, Babylonia, Ancient Persia and also Ancient Egypt. It originated in the Mediterranean basin and its vicinity; Ancient Greece[d] and Ancient Rome[e] are generally considered to be the birthplaces of Western civilization—Greece having heavily influenced Rome—the former due to its impact on philosophy, democracy, science, aesthetics, as well as building designs and proportions and architecture; the latter due to its influence on art, law, warfare, governance, republicanism, engineering and religion. Western civilization is also strongly associated with Christianity[61] (and to a lesser extent, with Judaism), which is in turn shaped by Hellenistic philosophy and Roman culture.[42] In the modern era, Western culture has been heavily influenced by the Renaissance, the Ages of Discovery and Enlightenment and the Industrial and Scientific Revolutions.[62][63] Through extensive imperialism, colonialism and Christianization by some Western powers in the 15th to 20th centuries and later exportation of mass culture, much of the rest of the world has been extensively influenced by Western culture, in a phenomenon often called Westernization.[verification needed][citation needed] Gold and garnet cloisonné (and mud), military fitting from the Staffordshire Hoard before cleaning US Supreme Court (1932—1935) building, built in neoclassical style, an architectural style of the Western world Historians, such as Carroll Quigley in "The Evolution of Civilizations",[64] contend that Western civilization was born around AD 500,[verification needed] after the total collapse of the Western Roman Empire, leaving a vacuum for new ideas to flourish that were impossible in Classical societies. In either view, between the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the Renaissance, the West (or those regions that would later become the heartland of the culturally "western sphere") experienced a period of first, considerable decline,[65] and then readaptation, reorientation and considerable renewed material, technological and political development.[citation needed] Classical culture of the ancient Western world was partly preserved during this period due to the survival of the Eastern Roman Empire and the introduction of the Catholic Church; it was also greatly expanded by the Arab importation[66][67] of both the Ancient Greco-Roman and new technology through the Arabs from India and China to Europe.[68][69] Since the Renaissance, the West evolved beyond the influence of the ancient Greeks and Romans and the Islamic world, due to the successful Second Agricultural, Commercial,[70] Scientific,[71] and Industrial[72] revolutions (propellers of modern banking concepts). The West rose further with the 18th century's Age of Enlightenment and through the Age of Exploration's expansion of peoples of Western and Central European empires, particularly the globe-spanning colonial empires of 18th and 19th centuries.[73] Numerous times, this expansion was accompanied by Catholic missionaries, who attempted to proselytize Christianity. There was debate among some in the 1960s as to whether Latin America as a whole is in a category of its own.[74] Culture Further information: Western Europe and Eastern Europe This section is an excerpt from Western culture.[edit] Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man, based on the correlations of ideal human proportions with geometry described by the ancient Roman architect Vitruvius in Book III of his treatise De architectura Vatican City in Europe (home of the Roman Curia) Plato, arguably the most influential figure in early Western philosophy, has influenced virtually all of subsequent Western and Middle Eastern philosophy and theology Western culture, also known as Western civilization, European civilisation, Occidental culture, or Western society, is an umbrella term which refers to the diverse heritages of social norms, ethical values, traditional customs, belief systems, political systems, artifacts and technologies of the Western world. In a broader context, Western culture draws upon distinct elements primarily from Christian, Greco-Roman, Jewish, Germanic, Iberian, Celtic and Nordic cultures.[75][76] Whilst Western culture is a broad concept, and does not relate to a region with fixed geographical confines, it often relates to the cultures of countries with historical ties to a European country or a number of European countries, or the variety of cultures within Europe itself. However, countries toward the east of Europe are often excluded from definitions of the Wester contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 47 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Western_world responseCode 3 200
