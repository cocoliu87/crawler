His older first cousins (through his elder paternal uncle) Kamran and Umar Akmal were the reason he was attracted to cricket, and their stories inspired him to take up cricket as his profession. He had been a ball boy at Gaddafi Stadium[14] before joining a cricket academy and starting his domestic cricket career there. He was present during the home series Pakistan played between 2006 and 2008. He sought guidance from Rana Sadiq, his first coach, who taught him the fundamentals of batting. Later, he went on to be a part of the Pakistan U-19(under 19) setup. International career Early career In May 2015, Babar was included in the Pakistani ODI squad for home series against Zimbabwe.[15] He made his ODI debut in the third ODI on 31 May and scored an impressive fifty scoring 54 runs off 60 balls.[16] His impressive debut earned him a place in both Test and ODI squads selected for an away series against Sri Lanka. He was not selected to play in the Test series. During the ODI series, he only scored 37 runs in the two matches that he played.[17] Babar was included in the squad for the away ODI series against Zimbabwe in September 2015.[18] He was retained in the ODI squad for the home series against England. In the first ODI of the four match series he scored 62 not out with a strike rate of 100 which helped Pakistan win the match.[19] He had scores of 4, 22 and 51 in next three matches respectively.[20] He finished the series with 139 runs at an average of 46.33.[21] In January 2016, Pakistan toured New Zealand.

In the first match of the ODI series he scored his maiden international century, scoring 120 off 131 balls and winning his first man of the match award.[29] In the second ODI, he scored another century, this time scoring 123 off 126 balls, and helping Pakistan to put up a total of more than 330.[30] In the third and final ODI of the series Azam ended up scoring a third consecutive century (117 from 106).[20] He also broke the record for scoring the most runs (360) in a three match ODI series.[31] He became the only batsman to score 350+ runs in a three match ODI series.[32] He made his Test debut for Pakistan against the West Indies in Dubai on 13 October 2016 and scored 69 runs in his first innings.[33] He was the first player to score a fifty on his Test debut through a day/night Test.[34] On 19 January 2017, in the third ODI against Australia, Azam became then joint-fastest player to score 1,000 runs in ODIs and then fastest for Pakistan in his 21st innings before his national record and world record was eclipsed by his compatriot Fakhar Zaman.[35][36] He scored a century in the fifth ODI, which was only the second century ever scored by a Pakistani batsman in Australia after Zaheer Abbas in 1981.[37] He also entered the top 10 batsmen's ranking in ODIs for the first time ever.[38] Sarfaraz Ahmed replaced Azhar Ali as Pakistan's ODI team captain against the West Indies after Azhar Ali stepped down from the captaincy after a humiliating defeat against Australia in ODI series. He scored an unbeaten 125 in the 2nd ODI of the three–match ODI series at Providence Stadium, Guyana.[20] Azam along with Imad Wasim put on an unbeaten 99 runs partnership which helped Pakistan to a total of 282.[39] Meanwhile, Azam also broke the record of scoring the most runs after the first 25 ODI innings in this match.[40] In the Champions Trophy 2017, Azam scored 46 off 52 balls in the final match against India.[20] After a successful Champions trophy tour, ICC sent the World XI team in Pakistan where they played three T20I matches.
