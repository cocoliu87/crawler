Yew Tee station is named after an expunged village that once stood in the area.[1] The station primarily serves Neighbourhoods 5 to 7 of Choa Chu Kang New Town as well as Sungei Kadut Industrial Estate. History[edit] Yew Tee station shortly after opening in 1996. The station was built in 1995, together with the other stations of the North South line Woodlands Extension. The two-storey station building, with a simple facade and a kampung-style roof, was officially opened on 10 February 1996 along with the other five stations on the Woodlands Extension. During the construction of the Woodlands extension, land between the Yew Tee and Kranji MRT stations was acquired. Measuring a total of 18,685 m sq, affecting a total of 16 factories operating along the stretch. Initially named Choa Chu Kang North, it was renamed to Yew Tee in 1994.[2] Following numerous incidents of commuters falling on the tracks and unauthorized intrusions, the Land Transport Authority made the decision in 2008 to install half height platform screen doors for all above-ground stations in phases.[3] The platform screen doors started operations at this station on 1 February 2012. This station was installed with high-volume low-speed fans, which commenced operations on 27 November that year, together with Kranji station.[4] References[edit] ^ "Yew Tee MRT". Infopedia.
