Thanks. Archived discussion for August 2007 from Wikipedia:In the news section on the Main Page/Candidates. August 29 The Taliban agree to release 19 South Korean hostages, ending a forty day crisis The wording may need tweaking, but this is a major story. New England Review Me!/Go Red Sox! 05:18, 29 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] They've agreed to release them, but they haven't said when they will do it. They may still be hostages for some time. --Peta 06:53, 29 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Wikipedia is not a newspaper, when the situation comes to an end, and our article is updated to beyond that of what one would expect from a news service, then we can include the item. (Also "40 day crisis" will become 41 soon...) --Monotonehell 09:06, 29 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Looks like 3 have been released and more will be soon. I say that is enough for inclusion. --Mougie149 19:20, 29 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Remember Wikipedia is not Wikinews. There must be a substantial update to the article above what one would expect from a news service. One or two sentences added to a dot point list isn't in depth or encyclopaedic. --Monotonehell 22:17, 29 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] How about adding the following formulation It is agreed that Taliban will release the remaining South Korean hostages in return for South Korea withdrawing its 200 non-combat troops within the year and suspending missionary work in Afghanistan. I think it is reasonable to add the news item now, as the outcome of the situation has been determined. I think the article is useful as is, as it has a large story up to this point. Thue | talk 22:54, 29 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Can someone update the article? If the situation has been determined, why doesn't our article reflect this? If the situstion has not been resolved then we've jumped the gun on this one. --Monotonehell 11:43, 30 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] My item used only information which was already in the Wikipedia article. Thue | talk 17:07, 30 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Now the article has an update tag on it. I don't have enough background to be confident to do an update to it. But it's still out of date and shouldn't be on ITN in this state. --Monotonehell 07:55, 31 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Can links to Military of South Korea and International Security Assistance Force be included in the line on 2007 South Korean hostage crisis in Afghanistan? More relevant than current links. --74.13.129.88 07:05, 2 September 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I would like to include a link to at least International Security Assistance Force, but that article does not currently mention South Korea's contribution, so it wouldn't be very helpfull. Thue | talk 08:44, 2 September 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] August 28 The Supreme Court of Chile upholds a life sentence for the first senior military official sentenced to life for human rights violations during the rule of Augusto Pinochet. Notable decision; no article on the ex-general yet though. --Peta 02:22, 29 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I would support it if the General had his own article. I don't think the two chineese food/health officials who were executed for taking bribes on ITN. New England Review Me!/Go Red Sox! 02:26, 29 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I've started it, but my lack of Spanish language skills prevents me form writing much more. --Peta 02:58, 29 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I'd support an item about this. The article is still a bit short, but I think it's passable. How's this wording: The Supreme Court of Chile upholds a life sentence for Hugo Salas Wenzel, the first senior military official sentenced to life for human rights violations during the rule of Augusto Pinochet. Does that look OK? —Josiah Rowe (talk • contribs) 03:57, 29 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] It looks ok, and I support adding it to ITN, but objections havve been raised about using articles that short. New England Review Me!/Go Red Sox! 04:00, 29 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Then I'll wait for more opinions before adding it. —Josiah Rowe (talk • contribs) 04:43, 29 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] The general rule of thumb that I use is that an article must have more information that one would expect from a newspaper article. This is to satisfy the criteria "wikipedia is not a news paper" and "must be a substantial update". At this point the article is too stubby. Instead of starting a new article perhaps you should be reviewing the articles linked from Augusto Pinochet to see if there's a better place/existing article? --Monotonehell 09:13, 29 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Abdullah Gül is elected as the 11th President of Turkey by the Turkish Parliament, after secularist concerns delayed his initial candidacy. Radagast 15:27, 28 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Added. Thue | talk 16:05, 28 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Antonio Puerta Pérez died three days after suffering a heart attack during a league game against Getafe CF. Puerta's premature death from heart problems is similar to those of Marc-Vivien Foe and Miklos Feher. Marco Alfarrobinha {chat}contributions 16:52, 28 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I don't think this should be added. It doesn't have any historic significance. Thue | talk 17:07, 28 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] A professional sportsman dying during the practice of a major sport is important. Marco Alfarrobinha {chat}contributions 18:01, 28 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Not really, Corey Stringer doesn't even have his own article. New England Review Me!/Go Red Sox! 18:08, 28 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Yes he does. Of course, this definitely should not (and clearly will not) be o ITN, but I still wanted to point that out. -- Kicking222 14:34, 30 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Doesn't seem to meet any of the 3 death criteria to me. I thought maybe there was something significant e.g. the other deaths were potentially linked to drug use but this doesn't seem to be the case, one had a congenital defect. Also wording isn't great. I call football football but wasn't sure what sport that was referring to when I read the line. Getafe CF isn't exactly MU. Nil Einne 20:56, 28 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] We didn't add anything about the whole Chris Benoit murder-suicide. I fail to see how this is more notable. Keep it off, it has no major significance. --Plasma Twa 2 22:09, 28 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I disagree that this is comparable to the Benoit murder-suicide. A professional athlete having a heart attack on the field of play and as a result dying is different to a professional athlete murdering his family and committing suicide. Although different, both of these events seem to meet death criterion 2 to me. Hammer Raccoon 12:18, 29 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I don't even know who this guy is ("the deceased was in a high ranking office of power at the time of death"). And would his death change football policies ("the death has a major international impact that affects current events")? --Howard the Duck 13:04, 29 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] It says for a death to be placed on ITN it has to meet "one of the following criteria". I refer to criterion 2: "the deceased was a key figure in their field of expertise, and died unexpectedly or tragically", not criteria 1 and 3. I think it is a given that the death was unexpected and tragic. Whether he was a key figure in his field of expertise is more debatable. However, he was a Spanish international, and a member of the Sevilla team that won the UEFA Cup and Copa del Rey in 2007. Whether you know who this guy is or not is irrelevant. Hammer Raccoon 13:26, 29 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] He's certainly not in the calibre of Raúl González in order to satisfy criteria #2: ("the deceased was a key figure in their field of expertise, and died unexpectedly or tragically" - a in other words, a person must die tragically and at the same time must be a key figure in his/her field). However, if his death on a bigger stage (like national team tourneys), then it may be added. --Howard the Duck 14:20, 29 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Yup, I pretty much agree that this doesn't meet current criteria, but I feel that it is extraordinary enough to merit mention. Somehow, I don't see this happening. Hammer Raccoon 22:05, 29 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] August 27 Alberto Gonzales resigns from his office. Would be great if this could be added in to In the News section on the mainpage. xeryus 12:52, 27 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] The wording for this should be "United States Attorney General Albert Gonzales announces his resignation effective September 17th". New England Review Me!/Go Red Sox! 19:01, 27 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Some people are saying his resignation is noteable because of the scandal surrounding him. But if this is the case then we need to actually mention the scandals otherwise there's absolutely no context about why this matters and the scandal is irrelevant IMHO in deciding whether this qualifies for ITN Nil Einne 21:39, 27 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Is people resigning from their job alone really big news enough to warrant front page exposure? (unless of course they are president/prime-minister perhaps) Maybe someone could add a little context for those of us outside the U.S. as to why this is important news? Was he forced to do so because of a political scandal? thanks. Kilrogg 21:20, 27 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] There is a big discussion in the talk page, feel free to join it.
