Gaucho from Argentina, photographed in Peru, 1868 A gaucho ( Spanish: [ˈɡawtʃo]) or gaúcho ( Portuguese: [ɡaˈuʃu]) is a skilled horseman, reputed to be brave and unruly. The figure of the gaucho is a folk symbol of Argentina, Uruguay, Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, southern part of Bolivia,[1] and the south of Chilean Patagonia.[2] Gauchos became greatly admired and renowned in legend, folklore, and literature and became an important part of their regional cultural tradition. Beginning late in the 19th century, after the heyday of the gauchos, they were celebrated by South American writers. The gaucho in some respects resembled members of other nineteenth century rural, horse-based cultures such as the North American cowboy (vaquero in Spanish), huaso of Central Chile, the Peruvian chalan or morochuco, the Venezuelan and Colombian llanero, the Ecuadorian chagra, the Hawaiian paniolo,[3] the Mexican charro, and the Portuguese campino. According to the Diccionario de la lengua española, in its historical sense a gaucho was a "mestizo who, in the 18th and 19th centuries, inhabited Argentina, Uruguay, and Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, and was a migratory horseman, and adept in cattle work".[4] In Argentina and Uruguay today, gaucho can refer to any "country person, experienced in traditional livestock farming".[4] Because historical gauchos were reputed to be brave, if unruly, the word is also applied metaphorically to mean "noble, brave and generous", but also "one who is skillful in subtle tricks, crafty".[4] In Portuguese the word gaúcho means "an inhabitant of the plains of Rio Grande do Sul or the Pampas of Argentina of European and indigenous American descent who devotes himself to lassoing and raising cattle and horses"; gaúcho has also acquired a metonymic signification in Brazil, meaning anyone, even an urban dweller, who is a citizen of the state of Rio Grande do Sul.[5][6] Etymology[edit] Many explanations have been proposed, but no-one really knows how the word "gaucho" originated.[7][8] Already in 1933 an author counted 36 different theories;[9] more recently, over fifty.[10] They can proliferate because "there is no documentation of any sort that will fix its origin to any time, place or language".[11] Resemblance theories[edit] Most seem to have been conjured up by finding a word that looks something like gaucho and guessing that it changed to its present form, perhaps without awareness that there are sound laws that describe how languages and words really evolve over time. The etymologist Joan Corominas said most of these theories were "not worthy of discussion". Of the following explanations, Rona said that only #5, #8 and #9 might be taken seriously.[12] Some proposed explanations for "gaucho" # Proposer Alleged root and evolution Objection(s) Discussed in 1 Emeric Essex Vidal Same root as English gawky (awkward, uncouth) Earliest theory (1820), dismissed as "humorous"[a] Paullada 1961;[13] Trifilo 1964[14] 2 Monlau and Diez French gauche (rough, uncouth) > Argentine gaucho.

Assunção[h] Learned Sp. gaucho (in math. & architecture, "not level", "warped") Elite technical word unknown to the masses Assunção 2011;[29] Hollinger 1928.[30] The dialect frontier theory[edit] The Río de la Plata basin A different approach is to consider that the word might have originated north of the Río de la Plata, where the indigenous languages were quite different and there is a Portuguese influence. Two facts that any theory could usefully account for are: The word actually exists in two forms: Port. gaúcho and Sp. gaucho, both long attested. Gauchos are first mentioned by name in the Spanish colonial records for present-day Uruguay, often in connection with smuggling to Brazil (see below, Origins). Thus Azara wrote (around 1784): There is in that land, and particularly around Montevideo and Maldonado, another class of people, most appropriately called gauchos or gauderios. Commonly all are criminals escaped from the jails of Spain and Brazil, or they belong to the number of those who, because of their atrocities, have had to flee to the wilderness... When the gaucho has some necessity or caprice to satisfy, he steals a few horses or cows, takes them to Brazil where he sells them and where he gets whatever it is he needs.[31] Hence the Uruguayan sociolinguist José Pedro Rona thought the origin of the word was to be sought "on the frontier zone between Spanish and Portuguese, which goes from northern Uruguay to the Argentine province of Corrientes and the Brazilian area between them".[32] Rona, himself born on a language frontier in pre-Holocaust Europe,[i] was a pioneer of the concept of linguistic borders, and studied the dialects of northern Uruguay where Portuguese and Spanish intermingle.[33] Rona thought that, of the two forms — gaúcho and gaucho — the former probably came first, because it was linguistically more natural for gaúcho to evolve by accent-shift to gáucho, than the other way round.[34] Thus the problem came down to explaining the origin of gaúcho. The earliest depiction of a Uruguayan gaucho (Emeric Essex Vidal, Picturesque Illustrations of Buenos Ayres and Monte Video, 1820) As to that, Rona thought that gaúcho originated in northern Uruguay, and came from garrucho, a derisive word[35] possibly of Charrua[36] origin, which meant something like "old indian" or "contemptible person", and is actually found[37] in the historical record. However in the Portuguese-based dialects of northern Uruguay the phoneme /rr/ is not easily pronounced, and so is rendered as /h/ (sounding rather like English h).[38] Thus garrucho would be rendered as gahucho, and indeed the French naturalist Auguste de Saint-Hilaire, travelling in Uruguay during the Artigas insurgency, wrote in his diary (16 October 1820): Ces hommes sans religion et sans morale, le plus part indiens ou métis, que les Portugais désignaient sous le nom de "Garruchos ou Gahuchos". (Those men without religion or morals, mostly indians or half-breeds, that the Portuguse call Garruchos or Gahuchos).[39][40] The native Spanish-speakers of these borderlands, however, could not process the phoneme /h/, and would render it as a null, thus gaúcho.[41] In sum, according to this theory, gaúcho originated in the Uruguay-Brazil dialect borderlands, deriving from a derisive indigenous word garrucho, then in Spanish lands evolved by accent-shift to gaucho. History[edit] The historical "gaucho" is elusive, because there has been more than one kind. Mythologisation has obscured the topic. Origins[edit] Itinerant horsemen, hunting wild cattle on the pampas, originated as a social class during the 17th century. "The great natural abundance of the pampa", wrote Richard W. Slatta, with its plethora of cattle, horses, ostriches,[42] and other wild game, meant that a skilled horseman and hunter could live without permanent employment by selling hides, feathers, pelts, and eating free beef. This pampean largess shaped the gaucho's independent, migratory existence and his aversion to a sedentary regimen".[43] Spanish official Félix de Azara, by Goya The original gaucho was typically descended from unions between Iberian men and Amerindian women, although he might also have African ancestry.[44] A DNA analysis study of rural inhabitants of Rio Grande do Sul, who style themselves gaúchos, has claimed to discern, not only Amerindian (Charrúa and Guaraní) ancestry in the female line but, in the male line, a higher proportion of Spanish ancestry than is usual in Brazil.[45] However, gauchos were a social class, not an ethnic group. Gauchos are first mentioned by name in the 18th century records of the Spanish colonial authorities who administered the Banda Oriental (present-day Uruguay). For them, he is an outlaw, cattle thief, robber and smuggler.[46][47] Félix de Azara (1790) said gauchos were "the dregs of the Rio de la Plata and of Brazil". Summarised one scholar: "Fundamentally [the gaucho of the time] was a colonial bootlegger whose business was contraband trade in cattle hides. His work was highly illegal; his character lamentably reprehensible; his social standing exceedingly low.[48] "Gaucho" was an insult; yet it was possible to use the word to refer, without animosity, to contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 40 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Gaucho responseCode 3 200
