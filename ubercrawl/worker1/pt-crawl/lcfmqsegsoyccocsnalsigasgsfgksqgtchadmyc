lcfmqsegsoyccocsnalsigasgsfgksqgtchadmyc length 5 96315 page 10006 The Current events portal and associated pages contains news listed on a daily basis with a link to background articles. Of primary importance are events. In addition, trends and developments are also listworthy. Summary of edit instructions[edit] This section contains the brief summary of edit instructions that is automatically shown when editing the Current events portal, and is found at Portal:Current events/Edit instructions: Instructions for initialising page if the bot has failed to The daily current events "blank" boxes are now generated daily by an efficient bot, so the instructions below this only apply if the bot has been disabled. If you reached this page via the current date box's "edit" link, check whether the portal box has already been initiated, and already contains the following (parsed) wiki code (use copy/paste from the code below, if necessary, to correct any syntax errors): {{Current events|year={{subst:CURRENTYEAR}}|month={{subst:CURRENTMONTH}}|day={{subst:CURRENTDAY}}|content=
<!-- All news items below this line -->
*
<!-- All news items above this line -->}}
 Then save the page, before adding any news items. This will help insure the new day displays according to the current events portal design. Note that the above items: CURRENTYEAR, CURRENTMONTH, and CURRENTDAY, all will display as positive integers once the page is saved. For example, the code to generate March 27, 2009 (Friday) in the box should appear as {{Current events|year=2009|month=3|day=27|content=... Before posting, please make sure you are familiar with posting policies and guidelines: Please log news events as complete sentences, in the present tense, with links to reliable sources (stories without links will be removed). Each news item should be posted under an appropriate heading, such as: Armed conflicts and attacks, Arts and culture, Business and economy, Disasters and accidents, Health and environment, International relations, Law and crime, Politics and elections, Science and technology, Sports. If a news item is part of a larger event, list it under a subheader consisting of a link to the larger event. Don't create subheaders linking to general topics or lists. Stories added to the main portal page should be of international interest. Stories of only regional or topical interest belong in their appropriate sub-pages, if any. Do not list the ordinary deaths of prominent persons here. That's what recent deaths is for. Exceptions to this rule are made for prominent persons who died in office (such as Pope John Paul II and Omar Bongo) or other instances where the death in itself has a major impact. Wikipedia policies concerning biographies of living persons (BLP) should be followed, including WP:BLPNAME and WP:BLPCRIME. Stories should be added under the date in which they occurred in local time. Most news sources indicate the day of the week in which an event occurred. English language news stories are preferred, though foreign language sources can be used if English-language coverage is unavailable. For each item, please update the most relevant linked article if it is appropriate. Please avoid links to subscription-only sites such as AOL or WSJ (except in the unlikely event that a story is covered substantially better there than anywhere else). If conflicts begin between editors, please start a discussion here. Example news item: '''Politics and elections'''

 Talk page for edit instructions summary How the current events portal helps Wikipedia[edit] This portal attracts visitors seeking information about topics that are big at the moment, resulting in an increased readership and improvement of Wikipedia articles related to such topics. Scope and relation to Wikinews[edit] Unless otherwise specified, this content deals with Current events day by day. For more information about the concise template which is visible on the Main Page of Wikipedia, see Wikipedia:In the news. The Portal:Current events page also contains Boxes in right sidebar. Wikipedia is not a news service[edit] In contrast to Wikinews, the purpose of Wikipedia does not include writing about breaking news stories. Rather, Wikipedia has its own notability criteria (Wikipedia:Notability). One very significant danger is that news articles must be kept current in order to remain accurate. Wikipedians might begin a news article and then simply lose interest in the topic, whereupon the article becomes inaccurate. In short, we aren't set up to be an amateur news organization, and we shouldn't try to compete with professional news organizations. Moreover, Wikipedia is not a collection of primary source material. Direct first-hand reporting of current events is primary source material. Wikinews accepts primary source material, however, and is a repository of such primary source material that is there for Wikipedia to cite. Wikinews can also be cited in its capacity as an amalgam of primary sources. Citing a news summary article on Wikinews, which in its turn cites the multitude of news sources that it is summarizing, can save Wikipedia the trouble of citing the long list of news sources directly itself. Short entries[edit] Entries on Current events are brief summaries of the topic at hand, preferably no more than 30–40 words. For more information, links are given to one or more Wikipedia articles, as well as one or more external news articles. Wikipedia is a news backgrounder[edit] Many news topics are notable enough to fulfill the notability criteria for becoming Wikipedia articles, while some only have specific articles in for example Wikinews. In any case, Wikipedia contains articles on the background of related topics. For example, Wikipedia does not only include an article on the Fall of Mazar-i-Sharif, but also to the War in Afghanistan (2001–present) and Mazar-i-Sharif. Wikipedia and Wikinews complement each other in this respect. Just as Wikinews can provide or collate primary source material on current events for Wikipedia, saving Wikipedia trouble, Wikipedia can provide in-depth background articles to Wikinews about people, places, and things in the news, saving Wikinews the trouble of writing, and maintaining, backgrounders. In contrast, professional news organizations have no encyclopaedia as a sibling project to call upon. Notability[edit] Significance of a subject follows the same rules as for "In the news" on the main page of Wikipedia (although Portal:Current events is slightly more inclusionist). See: Wikipedia:In the news#Significance. On the other hand, the existence of a Wikipedia article specifically about the topic is not necessary for making a Portal:Current events entry, but there should be a link to a more or less related Wikipedia article. Even if an event does not merit a separate Wikipedia article, it can often be included in broadly scoped articles such as List of terrorist incidents in 2023 or 2023 Atlantic hurricane season. Inclusion of an event does not mean that every similar type of event is notable. For example, after a major earthquake, even an aftershock thereof needs its own consideration of its impact before inclusion. Page creation[edit] The bot account Cyberbot I creates a 'blank' current events page for the following day at 03:30 UTC, so wiki users will never have to create the page themselves. The 'blank' page is created with the following code: {{Current events|year=2018|month=06|day=10|content=

<!-- All news items below this line -->
*
<!-- All news items above this line -->}}
 Which looks like this: June 10, 2018 (2018-06-10) (Sunday) edit history watch Instructions for initialising page if the bot has failed to The instructions below this only apply if the bot has been disabled. If you reached this page via the current date box's "edit" link, check whether the portal box has already been initiated, and already contains the following (parsed) wiki code (use copy/paste from the code below, if necessary, to correct any syntax errors): {{Current events|year={{subst:CURRENTYEAR}}|month={{subst:CURRENTMONTH}}|day={{subst:CURRENTDAY}}|content=
<!-- All news items below this line -->
*
<!-- All news items above this line -->}}
 Then save the page, before adding any news items. This will help insure the new day displays according to the current events portal design. Note that the above items: CURRENTYEAR, CURRENTMONTH, and CURRENTDAY, all will display as positive integers once the page is saved. For example, the code to generate March 27, 2009 (Friday) in the box should appear as {{Current events|year=2009|month=3|day=27|content=... Categories[edit] News items should always be added with categories. The categories are as follows: Arts and culture Armed conflicts and attacks Business and economy Disasters and accidents Health and environment International relations Law and crime Politics and elections Science and technology Sports News items which do not fit into any of the above categories shouldn't be added. Setting the context[edit] It is customary, if possible, to indicate the context for a story at the start of the line. A good (hypothetical) example would be: SCO v. IBM Linux lawsuit SCO Group files subpoenas for Richard Stallman and Linus Torvalds. (1) The context string, SCO v. IBM Linux lawsuit, links to a story on the relevant topic. This is ideal but not always possible. Here is another good example: Israeli–Palestinian conflict A hard-hitting United Nations report says that Israel will effectively annex large areas of Palestinian territory as a result of the permits it intends to issue to Palestinians near the controversial "security wall" currently being erected in the West Bank.
