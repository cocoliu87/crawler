The year 1945 saw a number of significant happenings in radio broadcasting history. Events[edit] 30 January – Adolf Hitler makes his last public speech to be delivered personally, on broadcast radio, expressing the belief that Germany will triumph in World War II. 15 March – The Academy Awards are broadcast on the radio in their entirety for the first time, on ABC and the Armed Forces Radio. 12 April – The death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt interrupts programming on radio networks in the United States. On CBS, John Charles Daly interrupts his narration of Wilderness Road to read the wire message. 15 April – BBC correspondent Richard Dimbleby accompanies the British 11th Armoured Division to the liberation of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, making one of the first reports from there.[1] His description of what he sees ("the world of a nightmare") is so graphic, the BBC declines to broadcast his dispatch for 4 days, relenting only when he threatens to resign. 8 May – American soldiers fighting in the Pacific theater listen to radio reports of Victory in Europe Day 1 May – Reichssender Hamburg's Flensburg substation, the last shortwave radio station remaining on the air in Germany, announces the death of Adolf Hitler. The first place in the United Kingdom to hear of this is the BBC Monitoring Service at Caversham Park near Reading, Berkshire. President of Germany Karl Dönitz gives a broadcast this night declaring that it is his task to save the German people "from destruction by Bolshevists."[2] 2 May – During the Battle of Berlin, the Red Army occupies the Haus des Rundfunks, headquarters of the Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft broadcasting organization. 4 May – Radio Hamburg begins broadcasting from the British occupied zone of Germany, with Wynford Vaughan-Thomas speaking from "Lord Haw-Haw"'s studio for the BBC. On 22 September, the station becomes Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk (NWDR), the zone's official broadcasting organisation, set up by Hugh Greene,[3] and in November the North German Radio Symphony Orchestra plays its first concert. 5 May – Supporters of the Czech Resistance on the staff of Czech Radio encourage the Prague uprising, leading to the Battle for Czech Radio.[4] 6 May – Mildred Gillars ("Axis Sally") delivers her last propaganda broadcast to Allied troops (the first was on 11 December 1941). 7 May – The last German communication to be decoded at Bletchley Park is from a military radio station at Cuxhaven closing down.[5] Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk, Leading Minister in the rump Flensburg Government, makes a broadcast announcing the German surrender. This evening the BBC in the United Kingdom announces that the following day will be a holiday, Victory in Europe Day. 8 May – Victory in Europe Day in Western Europe. At 12:30 President of Germany Karl Dönitz broadcasts on his country's surrender to the nation. At 15:00 BST in the United Kingdom, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, makes a speech to the nation on the BBC from 10 Downing Street, and at 21:00 King George VI speaks to the British Empire from Buckingham Palace. Wynford Vaughan-Thomas reports from Lüneburg and Frank Gillard from Kassel.[6] On 9 May (Moscow Time) the surrender is announced on Radio Moscow by Yuri Levitan.[7] 28 May – U.S.-born Irish-raised William Joyce ("Lord Haw-Haw") is captured by British forces on the German border two days after recording his final (rambling and audibly drunk) propaganda broadcast. He is later charged with high treason in London for his English-language wartime broadcasts on German radio, convicted, and then hanged in January 1946. 29 July – The BBC Light Programme radio station is launched, concentrating on the broadcasting of mainstream light music and entertainment, superseding the BBC General Forces Programme within the United Kingdom using its longwave frequency from the Droitwich Transmitting Station. 7 August – Radio Tokyo first reports, unspecifically, on the previous day's bombing of Hiroshima. 15 August – Hirohito surrender broadcast: Emperor Hirohito's recorded announcement of the unconditional surrender of Japan is broadcast on Radio Tokyo a little after noon (Japan Standard Time).[8] This is probably the first time an Emperor of Japan has been heard by the common people. Delivered in formal classical Japanese, without directly referring to surrender and following official censorship of the country's weak position, the speech is not immediately easily understood by ordinary people. 5 September – Iva Toguri D'Aquino, a Japanese American suspected of being wartime radio propagandist "Tokyo Rose", is arrested in Yokohama. 11 September – Radio Republik Indonesia starts broadcasting. 1 November – Telechron introduces the model 8H59 Musalarm in the United States, the first clock radio.
