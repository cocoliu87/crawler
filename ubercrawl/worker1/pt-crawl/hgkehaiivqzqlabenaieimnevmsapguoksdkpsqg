For a more advanced treatment, see Group theory. The manipulations of the Rubik's Cube form the Rubik's Cube group. In mathematics, a group is a set with an operation that satisfies the following constraints: the operation is associative, has an identity element, and every element of the set has an inverse element. Many mathematical structures are groups endowed with other properties. For example, the integers with the addition operation form an infinite group, which is generated by a single element called 1 (these properties characterize the integers in a unique way). The concept of a group was elaborated for handling, in a unified way, many mathematical structures such as numbers, geometric shapes and polynomial roots. Because the concept of groups is ubiquitous in numerous areas both within and outside mathematics, some authors consider it as a central organizing principle of contemporary mathematics.[1][2] In geometry, groups arise naturally in the study of symmetries and geometric transformations: The symmetries of an object form a group, called the symmetry group of the object, and the transformations of a given type form a general group. Lie groups appear in symmetry groups in geometry, and also in the Standard Model of particle physics. The Poincaré group is a Lie group consisting of the symmetries of spacetime in special relativity. Point groups describe symmetry in molecular chemistry. The concept of a group arose in the study of polynomial equations, starting with Évariste Galois in the 1830s, who introduced the term group (French: groupe) for the symmetry group of the roots of an equation, now called a Galois group. After contributions from other fields such as number theory and geometry, the group notion was generalized and firmly established around 1870. Modern group theory—an active mathematical discipline—studies groups in their own right. To explore groups, mathematicians have devised various notions to break groups into smaller, better-understandable pieces, such as subgroups, quotient groups and simple groups. In addition to their abstract properties, group theorists also study the different ways in which a group can be expressed concretely, both from a point of view of representation theory (that is, through the representations of the group) and of computational group theory. A theory has been developed for finite groups, which culminated with the classification of finite simple groups, completed in 2004. Since the mid-1980s, geometric group theory, which studies finitely generated groups as geometric objects, has become an active area in group theory.

The following properties of integer addition serve as a model for the group axioms in the definition below. For all integers a {\displaystyle a} , b {\displaystyle b} and c {\displaystyle c} , one has ( a + b ) + c = a + ( b + c ) {\displaystyle (a+b)+c=a+(b+c)} . Expressed in words, adding a {\displaystyle a} to b {\displaystyle b} first, and then adding the result to c {\displaystyle c} gives the same final result as adding a {\displaystyle a} to the sum of b {\displaystyle b} and c {\displaystyle c} . This property is known as associativity. If a {\displaystyle a} is any integer, then 0 + a = a {\displaystyle 0+a=a} and a + 0 = a {\displaystyle a+0=a} . Zero is called the identity element of addition because adding it to any integer returns the same integer. For every integer a {\displaystyle a} , there is an integer b {\displaystyle b} such that a + b = 0 {\displaystyle a+b=0} and b + a = 0 {\displaystyle b+a=0} . The integer b {\displaystyle b} is called the inverse element of the integer a {\displaystyle a} and is denoted − a {\displaystyle -a} . The integers, together with the operation + {\displaystyle +} , form a mathematical object belonging to a broad class sharing similar structural aspects. To appropriately understand these structures as a collective, the following definition is developed. Definition[edit] The axioms for a group are short and natural... Yet somehow hidden behind these axioms is the monster simple group, a huge and extraordinary mathematical object, which appears to rely on numerous bizarre coincidences to exist. The axioms for groups give no obvious hint that anything like this exists. Richard Borcherds, Mathematicians: An Outer View of the Inner World[4] A group is a non-empty set G {\displaystyle G} together with a binary operation on G {\displaystyle G} , here denoted " ⋅ {\displaystyle \cdot } ", that combines any two elements a {\displaystyle a} and b {\displaystyle b} of G {\displaystyle G} to form an element of G {\displaystyle G} , denoted a ⋅ b {\displaystyle a\cdot b} , such that the following three requirements, known as group axioms, are satisfied:[5][6][7][a] Associativity For all a {\displaystyle a} , b {\displaystyle b} , c {\displaystyle c} in G {\displaystyle G} , one has ( a ⋅ b ) ⋅ c = a ⋅ ( b ⋅ c ) {\displaystyle (a\cdot b)\cdot c=a\cdot (b\cdot c)} . Identity element There exists an element e {\displaystyle e} in G {\displaystyle G} such that, for every a {\displaystyle a} in G {\displaystyle G} , one has e ⋅ a = a {\displaystyle e\cdot a=a} and a ⋅ e = a {\displaystyle a\cdot e=a} . Such an element is unique (see below). It is called the identity element of the group. (Some authors use neutral element instead of identity element.[citation needed]) Inverse element For each a {\displaystyle a} in G {\displaystyle G} , there exists an element b {\displaystyle b} in G {\displaystyle G} such that a ⋅ b = e {\displaystyle a\cdot b=e} and b ⋅ a = e {\displaystyle b\cdot a=e} , where e {\displaystyle e} is the identity element. For each a {\displaystyle a} , the element b {\displaystyle b} is unique (see below); it is called the inverse of a {\displaystyle a} and is commonly denoted a − 1 {\displaystyle a^{-1}} . Notation and terminology[edit] Formally, the group is the ordered pair of a set and a binary operation on this set that satisfies the group axioms. The set is called the underlying set of the group, and the operation is called the group operation or the group law. A group and its underlying set are thus two different mathematical objects. To avoid cumbersome notation, it is common to abuse notation by using the same symbol to denote both. This reflects also an informal way of thinking: that the group is the same as the set except that it has been enriched by additional structure provided by the operation. For example, consider the set of real numbers R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } , which has the operations of addition a + b {\displaystyle a+b} and multiplication a b {\displaystyle ab} . Formally, R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } is a set, ( R , + ) {\displaystyle (\mathbb {R} ,+)} is a group, and ( R , + , ⋅ ) {\displaystyle (\mathbb {R} ,+,\cdot )} is a field. But it is common to write R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } to denote any of these three objects. The additive group of the field R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } is the group whose underlying set is R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } and whose operation is addition. The multiplicative group of the field R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } is the group R × {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{\times }} whose underlying set is the set of nonzero real numbers R ∖ { 0 } {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \smallsetminus \{0\}} and whose operation is multiplication. More generally, one speaks of an additive group whenever the group operation is notated as addition; in this case, the identity is typically denoted 0 {\displaystyle 0} , and the inverse of an eleme contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 53 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Group_(mathematics) responseCode 3 200
