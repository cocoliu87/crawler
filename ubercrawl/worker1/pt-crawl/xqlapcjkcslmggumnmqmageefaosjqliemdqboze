In addition to cricket, The Oval has hosted a number of other historically significant sporting events. In 1870, it staged the first representative football match between England and Scotland, although this is not deemed to be an official international by FIFA.[10] It hosted the first FA Cup final in 1872,[11][12] as well as those between 1874[13] and 1892.[14] In 1876, it held both the England v. Wales and England v. Scotland rugby international matches and, in 1877, rugby's first varsity match.[15] It also hosted the finals of the 2004 & 2017 ICC Champions Trophy and the 2023 ICC World Test Championship Final. History[edit] The clock by the Members' entrance to the pavilion The Oval is built on part of the former Kennington Common. Cricket matches were played on the common throughout the early 18th century. The earliest recorded match was the London v Dartford match in June 1724. However, as the common was also used regularly for public executions of those convicted at the Surrey Assizes (it was the south London equivalent of Tyburn), cricket matches had moved away to the Artillery Ground by the 1740s. Kennington Common was eventually enclosed in the mid-19th century under a scheme sponsored by the royal family. In 1844, the site of the Kennington Oval was a cabbage patch and market garden[16][17] owned by the Duchy of Cornwall.[18][19] The Duchy was willing to lease the land for the purpose of a cricket ground, and on 10 March 1845 the first lease, which the club later assumed, was issued to Mr. William Houghton (then president of the progenitor Montpelier Cricket Club) by the Otter Trustees who held the land from the Duchy "to convert it into a subscription cricket ground",[20] for 31 years at a rent of £120 per annum[21] plus taxes amounting to £20.[22] The original contract for turfing The Oval cost £300;[21] the 10,000 grass turfs came from Tooting Common and were laid in the spring of 1845[19][20] allowing for the first cricket match to be played in May 1845. Hence, Surrey County Cricket Club (SCCC) was established in 1845.[5][20][23][24] The popularity of the ground was immediate and the strength of the SCCC grew. On 3 May 1875 the club acquired the remainder of the leasehold for a further term of 31 years from the Otter Trustees for the sum of £2,800.[25] In 1868, 20,000 spectators gathered at The Oval for the first game of the 1868 Aboriginal cricket tour of England, the first tour of England by any foreign side.[26] Thanks to C.W. Alcock, the Secretary of Surrey from 1872 to 1907,[27] the first Test match in England was played at The Oval in 1880 between England and Australia. The Oval, thereby, became the second ground to stage a Test, after Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).[28] In 1882, Australia won the Test by seven runs within two days. The Sporting Times printed a mocking obituary notice[29] for English cricket, which led to the creation of the Ashes trophy, which is still contested whenever England plays Australia.[30] The first Test double century was scored at The Oval in 1884 by Australia's Billy Murdoch.[31] Surrey's ground is noted as having the first artificial lighting at a sports arena, in the form of gas-lamps, dating to 1889.[32] The current pavilion was completed in time for the 1898 season.[21][33] In 1907, South Africa became the second visiting Test team to play a Test match at the ground. In 1928, the West Indies played its first Test match at The Oval, followed by New Zealand in 1931. In 1936, India became the fifth foreign visiting Test side to play at The Oval, followed by Pakistan in 1954 and Sri Lanka in 1998.[34] Zimbabwe, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Ireland have yet to play a Test match at The Oval.[35][36] The pavilion end in 1891 The Oval is referenced by the poet Philip Larkin in his poem about the First World War, "MCMXIV".[37] During World War II, The Oval was requisitioned, initially housing anti-aircraft searchlights. It was then turned into a prisoner-of-war camp, intended to hold enemy parachutists. However, as they never came, The Oval was never actually used for this purpose.[38] The first One Day International match at this venue was played on 7 September 1973 between England and West Indies.[39] It hosted matches of the 1975, 1979, 1983, and 1999 World Cups.[40] It also hosted five of the fifteen matches in the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy, including the final.[41] The Oval once held the record for the largest playing area of any Test venue in the world. That record has since been surpassed by Gaddafi Stadium in Pakistan, although The Oval remains the largest in Great Britain. Billionaire Paul Getty, who had a great affinity for cricket and was at one time SCCC President, built a replica of The Oval on his Wormsley Park estate.[42] The famous gasholders just outside the ground were built around 1853.[43] With the gasholders long disused, there was much speculation as to whether they should be demolished; however, many believe they are an integral part of The Oval's urban landscape and, therefore, their future looks secure. In 2016 the main gasholder was given official protected status as a historically important industrial structure.[44] On 20 August 2006, The Oval saw the first time a team forfeited a Test match. Pakistan were upset after umpires Darrell Hair and Billy Doctrove awarded five penalty runs to the opposition and changed the ball after ruling that the team had tampered with it on the fourth day of the final Test against England. Pakistan debated the matter during the tea break and then refused to come out for the final session in protest. By the time they relented and decided to resume, the umpires had already called time on the match and awarded the game to England by default.[45][46] The Oval hosted its hundredth Test, against South Africa, on 27 July 2017, becoming the fourth Test venue in the world after Lord's, MCG and SCG to do so.[47] Moeen Ali also became the first player to ever take a Test hat-trick at The Oval, bowling out South Africa in the second innings to win the match.[48] In Tests, the highest team score at The Oval is 903/7 declared by England against Australia on 20 August 1938. The leading run scorers are Len Hutton (1,521 runs), Alastair Cook (1,217 runs) and Graham Gooch (1,097 runs). The leading wicket takers are Ian Botham (52 wickets), Derek Underwood (45 wickets) and James Anderson (44 wickets). In ODIs, the highest team score at The Oval is 398/5 by New Zealand against England on 12 June 2015. The leading ODI run scorers are Eoin Morgan (630 runs), Marcus Trescothick (528 runs) and Joe Root (480 runs). The leading ODI wicket takers are James Anderson (30 wickets) and Darren Gough (13 wickets). In 2021, the Oval Invincibles were formed as a team in the newly-launched The Hundred competition. The initial games in both the men's and women's competition were played on the ground. End names[edit] The north-western end of The Oval is traditionally known as the Vauxhall End, as it is nearer to the district of Vauxhall and its railway station.[49][50] The opposite end (south-east) is known as the Pavilion End as it is the location of the Members' Pavilion.[49] 21st-century redevelopment[edit] Surrey v Yorkshire (OCS stand in background) At the end of the 2002 cricket season, Surrey started redeveloping the Vauxhall End.[51] The development included demolishing the outdated Surridge, Fender, Jardine, and Peter May north stands, and creating in their place a single four-tier grandstand. From completion until 2020 it was known as the OCS stand,[52] as it was sponsored by Outsourced Client Solutions International Facilities Management Services. As of the start of the 2021 season it is now known as the JM Finn stand because of a sponsorship deal with JM Finn [53] This work was completed in May 2005 and increased ground capacity to around 23,000.[54] In January 2007, Surrey CCC, announced plans to increase capacity by a further 2,000 seats, this time by redeveloping the Pavilion End. The Lock, Laker, and Peter May south stands were to be replaced by a new stand, which would have a  contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 42 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/The_Oval responseCode 3 200
