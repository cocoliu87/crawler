Medical condition Ménière's disease Other names Ménière's syndrome, idiopathic endolymphatic hydrops[1] Diagram of the inner ear Pronunciation /meɪnˈjɛərz/[2] Specialty Otolaryngology, Neurology Symptoms Feeling like the world is spinning, ringing in the ears, hearing loss, fullness in the ear[3][4] Usual onset 40s–60s[3] Duration 20 minutes to few hours per episode[5] Causes Unknown[3] Risk factors Family history[4] Diagnostic method Based on symptoms, hearing test[3] Differential diagnosis Vestibular migraine, transient ischemic attack[1] Treatment Low-salt diet, diuretics, corticosteroids, counselling[3][4] Prognosis After ~10 years hearing loss and chronic ringing[5] Frequency 0.3–1.9 per 1,000[1] Ménière's disease (MD) is a disease of the inner ear that is characterized by potentially severe and incapacitating episodes of vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, and a feeling of fullness in the ear.[3][4] Typically, only one ear is affected initially, but over time, both ears may become involved.[3] Episodes generally last from 20 minutes to a few hours.[5] The time between episodes varies.[3] The hearing loss and ringing in the ears can become constant over time.[4] The cause of Ménière's disease is unclear, but likely involves both genetic and environmental factors.[1][3] A number of theories exist for why it occurs, including constrictions in blood vessels, viral infections, and autoimmune reactions.[3] About 10% of cases run in families.[4] Symptoms are believed to occur as the result of increased fluid buildup in the labyrinth of the inner ear.[3] Diagnosis is based on the symptoms and a hearing test.[3] Other conditions that may produce similar symptoms include vestibular migraine and transient ischemic attack.[1] No cure is known.[3] Attacks are often treated with medications to help with the nausea and anxiety.[4] Measures to prevent attacks are overall poorly supported by the evidence.[4] A low-salt diet, diuretics, and corticosteroids may be tried.[4] Physical therapy may help with balance and counselling may help with anxiety.[3][4] Injections into the ear or surgery may also be tried if other measures are not effective, but are associated with risks.[3][5] The use of tympanostomy tubes (ventilation tubes) to improve vertigo and hearing in people with ménière's disease is not supported by definitive evidence.[5] Ménière's disease was identified in the early 1800s by Prosper Menière.[5] It affects between 0.3 and 1.9 per 1,000 people.[1] It typically starts in people 40 to 60 years old.[3][6] Females are more commonly affected than males.[1] After 5 to 15 years of symptoms, the episodes of the world spinning sometimes stop and the person is left with loss of balance, poor hearing in the affected ear, and ringing or other sounds in the affected ear or ears.[5] Signs and symptoms[edit] Ménière's is characterized by recurrent episodes of vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, and tinnitus; episodes may be preceded by a headache and a feeling of fullness in the ears.[4] People may also experience additional symptoms related to irregular reactions of the autonomic nervous system. These symptoms are not symptoms of Ménière's disease per se, but rather are side effects resulting from failure of the organ of hearing and balance, and include nausea, vomiting, and sweating, which are typically symptoms of vertigo, and not of Ménière's.[1] This includes a sensation of being pushed sharply to the floor from behind.[5] Sudden falls without loss of consciousness (drop attacks) may be experienced by some people.[1] Causes[edit] The cause of Ménière's disease is unclear, but likely involves both genetic and environmental factors.[1][3][7] A number of theories exist including constrictions in blood vessels, viral infections, and autoimmune reactions.[3] Mechanism[edit] Inner ear The initial triggers of Ménière's disease are not fully understood, with a variety of potential inflammatory causes that lead to endolymphatic hydrops, a distension of the endolymphatic spaces in the inner ear. Endolymphatic hydrops is strongly associated with developing Ménière's disease,[1] but not everyone with EH develops Ménière's disease: "The relationship between endolymphatic hydrops and Meniere's disease is not a simple, ideal correlation."[8] Additionally, in fully developed Ménière's disease, the balance system (vestibular system) and the hearing system (cochlea) of the inner ear are affected, but some cases occur where EH affects only one of the two systems enough to cause symptoms. The corresponding subtypes of the disease are called vestibular Ménière's disease, showing symptoms of vertigo, and cochlear Ménière's disease, showing symptoms of hearing loss and tinnitus.[9][10][11][12] The mechanism of Ménière's disease is not fully explained by EH, but fully developed EH may mechanically and chemically interfere with the sensory cells for balance and hearing, which can lead to temporary dysfunction and even to death of the sensory cells, which in turn can cause the typical symptoms of MD – vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus.[8][10] An estimated 30% of people with Ménière's disease have Eustachian tube dysfunction.[13] Diagnosis[edit] Audiograms illustrating normal hearing (left) and unilateral low-pitch hearing loss associated with Ménière's disease (right) Loudness discomfort levels (LDLs) – data of people with hyperacusis without hearing loss. Upper line: average hearing thresholds. Lower long line: LDLs of this group. Lower short line: LDLs of a reference group with normal hearing.[14] The diagnostic criteria as of 2015 define definite MD and probable MD as:[1][4] Definite Two or more spontaneous episodes of vertigo, each lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours Audiometrically documented low- to medium-frequency sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear on at least one occasion before, during, or after one of the episodes of vertigo Fluctuating aural symptoms (hearing, tinnitus, or fullness) in the affected ear Not better accounted for by another vestibular diagnosis Probable Two or more episodes of vertigo or dizziness, each lasting 20 minutes to 24 hours Fluctuating aural symptoms (hearing, tinnitus, or fullness) in the reported ear Not better accounted for by another vestibular diagnosis A common and important symptom of MD is hypersensitivity to sounds.[15] This hypersensitivity is easily diagnosed by measuring the loudness discomfort levels (LDLs).[16] Symptoms of MD overlap with migraine-associated vertigo (MAV) in many ways, but when hearing loss develops in MAV, it is usually in both ears, and this is rare in MD, and hearing loss generally does not progress in MAV as it does in MD.[1] People who have had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke can present with symptoms similar to MD, and in people at risk magnetic resonance imaging should be conducted to exclude TIA or stroke.[1] Other vestibular conditions that should be excluded include vestibular paroxysmia, recurrent unilateral vestibulopathy, vestibular schwannoma, or a tumor of the endolymphatic sac.[1] Management[edit] No cure for Ménière's disease is known, but medications, diet, physical therapy, and counseling, and some surgical approaches can be used to manage it.[4] More than 85% of patients with Ménière's disease get better from changes in lifestyle, medical treatment, or minimally invasive surgical procedures. Those procedures include intratympanic steroid therapy, intratympanic gentamicin therapy or endolymphatic sac surgery.[17] Medications[edit] During MD episodes, medications to reduce nausea are used, as are drugs to reduce the anxiety caused by vertigo.[4][18] For longer-term treatment to stop progression, the evidence base is weak for all treatments.[4] Although a causal relation between allergy and Ménière's disease is uncertain, medication to control allergies may be helpful.[19] To assist with vertigo and balance problems, glycopyrrolate has been found to be a useful vestibular suppressant in patients with Ménière's disease.[20] Diuretics, such as the thiazide-like diuretic chlortalidone, are widely used to manage MD on the theory that it reduces fluid buildup (pressure) in the ear.[21] Based on evidence from multiple but small clinical trials, diuretics appear to be useful for reducing the frequency of episodes of dizziness but do not seem to prevent hearing loss.[22][23] In cases where hearing loss and continuing severe episodes of vertigo occur, a chemical labyrinthectomy, in which a medication such as gentamicin is injected into the middle ear and kills parts of the vestibular apparatus, may be prescribed.[4][24][25] This treatment has the risk of worsening hearing loss.[24] Diet[edit] People with MD are often advised to reduce their sodium intake.[18][26] Reducing salt intake, however, has not been well studied.[26] Based on the assumption that MD is similar in nature to a migraine, some advise eliminating "migraine triggers" such as caffeine, but the evidence for this is weak.[18] There is no high-quality evidence that changing diet by restricting salt, caffeine or alcohol improves symptoms.[27] Physical therapy[edit] While use of physical therapy early after the onset of MD is probably not useful due to the fluctuating disease course, physical therapy to help retraining of the balance system appears to be useful to reduce both subjective and objective deficits in balance over the longer term.[4][28] Counseling[edit] The psychological distress caused by the vertigo and hearing loss may worsen the condition in some people.[29] Counseling may be useful to manage the distress,[4] as may education and relaxation techniques.[30] Surgery[edit] If symptoms do not improve with less invasive approaches and for cases where the condition is uncontrolled or persistent and affecting both ears, surgery may be considered.[4][18][31] Endolymphatic sac surgery[edit] Surgery to decompress the  contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 63 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/M%C3%A9ni%C3%A8re%27s_disease responseCode 3 200
