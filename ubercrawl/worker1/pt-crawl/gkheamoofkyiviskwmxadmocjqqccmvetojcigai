Popper proposed falsifiability as the cornerstone solution to both the problem of induction and the problem of demarcation. He insisted that, as a logical criterion, falsifiability is distinct from the related concept "capacity to be proven wrong" discussed in Lakatos's falsificationism.[C][D][E] Even being a logical criterion, its purpose is to make the theory predictive and testable, and thus useful in practice. Popper contrasted falsifiability to the intuitively similar concept of verifiability that was then current in logical positivism. He argues that the only way to verify a claim such as "All swans are white" would be if one could theoretically observe all swans,[F] which is not possible. Instead, falsifiability searches for the anomalous instance, such that observing a single black swan is theoretically reasonable and sufficient to logically falsify the claim. On the other hand, the Duhem–Quine thesis says that definitive experimental falsifications are impossible[1] and that no scientific hypothesis is by itself capable of making predictions, because an empirical test of the hypothesis requires one or more background assumptions.[2] According to Popper there is a clean asymmetry on the logical side[G] and falsifiability does not have the Duhem problem[H] because it is a logical criterion. Experimental research has the Duhem problem and other problems, such as induction,[I] but, according to Popper, statistical tests, which are only possible when a theory is falsifiable, can still be useful within a critical discussion. Philosophers such as Deborah Mayo consider that Popper "comes up short" in his description of the scientific role of statistical and data models.[3] As a key notion in the separation of science from non-science and pseudoscience, falsifiability has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent. The problem of induction and demarcation[edit] See also: Inductivism, Problem of induction, and Demarcation problem One of the questions in the scientific method is: how does one move from observations to scientific laws? This is the problem of induction. Suppose we want to put the hypothesis that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue (or induce) from "here is a white swan" to "all swans are white"; doing so would require a logical fallacy such as, for example, affirming the consequent.[4] Popper's idea to solve this problem is that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that not every swan is white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. Falsification uses the valid inference modus tollens: if from a law L {\displaystyle L} we logically deduce Q {\displaystyle Q} , but what is observed is ¬ Q {\displaystyle \neg Q} , we infer that the law L {\displaystyle L} is false. For example, given the statement L = {\displaystyle L=} "all swans are white", we can deduce Q = {\displaystyle Q=} "the specific swan here is white", but if what is observed is ¬ Q = {\displaystyle \neg Q=} "the specific swan here is not white" (say black), then "all swans are white" is false. More accurately, the statement Q {\displaystyle Q} that can be deduced is broken into an initial condition and a prediction as in C ⇒ P {\displaystyle C\Rightarrow P} in which C = {\displaystyle C=} "the thing here is a swan" and P = {\displaystyle P=} "the thing here is a white swan". If what is observed is C being true while P is false (formally, C ∧ ¬ P {\displaystyle C\wedge \neg P} ), we can infer that the law is false. For Popper, induction is actually never needed in science.[J][K] Instead, in Popper's view, laws are conjectured in a non-logical manner on the basis of expectations and predispositions.[5] This has led David Miller, a student and collaborator of Popper, to write "the mission is to classify truths, not to certify them".[6] In contrast, the logical empiricism movement, which included such philosophers as Moritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap, Otto Neurath, and A.J. Ayer wanted to formalize the idea that, for a law to be scientific, it must be possible to argue on the basis of observations either in favor of its truth or its falsity. There was no consensus among these philosophers about how to achieve that, but the thought expressed by Mach's dictum that "where neither confirmation nor refutation is possible, science is not concerned" was accepted as a basic precept of critical reflection about science.[7][8][9] Popper said that a demarcation criterion was possible, but we have to use the logical possibility of falsifications, which is falsifiability. He cited his encounter with psychoanalysis in the 1910s. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also.[L] For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if one finds an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true. A verification has no value in itself. But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, there is a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all.[M][N] In the definition of falsifiability, contradictions with observations are not used to support eventual falsifications, but for logical "falsifications" that show that the law makes risky predictions, which is completely different. On the basic philosophical side of this issue, Popper said that some philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless. In opposition to this view, Popper said that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a criterion of demarcation.[O] From Hume's problem to non problematic induction[edit] The problem of induction is often called Hume's problem. David Hume studied how human beings obtain new knowledge that goes beyond known laws and observations, including how we can discover new laws. He understood that deductive logic could not explain this learning process and argued in favour of a mental or psychological process of learning that would not require deductive logic. He even argued that this learning process cannot be justified by any general rules, deductive or not.[10] Popper accepted Hume's argument and therefore viewed progress in science as the result of quasi-induction, which does the same as induction, but has no inference rules to justify it.[11][12] Philip N. Johnson-Laird, professor of psychology, also accepted Hume's conclusion that induction has no justification. For him induction does not require justification and therefore can exist in the same manner as Popper's quasi-induction does.[13] When Johnson-Laird says that no justification is needed, he does not refer to a general method of justification that, to avoid a circular reasoning, would not itself require any justification. On the contrary, in agreement with Hume, he refers to the fact that there is no general method of justification for induction and that's ok, because the induction steps do not require justification.[13] Instead, these steps use patterns of induction that may or may not be applicable depending on the background knowledge. Johnson-Laird wrote: "[P]hilosophers have worried about which properties of objects warrant inductive inferences. The answer rests on knowledge: we don't infer that all the passengers on a plane are male because the first ten off the plane are men. We know that this observation doesn't rule out the possibility of a woman passenger."[13] The reasoning pattern that was not applied here is enumerative induction. Popper was interested in the overall learning process in science, to quasi-induction, which he also called the "path of science".[11] However, Popper did not show much interest in these reasoning patterns, which he globally referred to as psychologism.[14] He did not deny the possibility of some kind of psychological explanation for the learning process, especially when psychology is seen as an extension of biology, but he felt that these biological explanations were not within the scope of epistemology.[P][Q] Popper proposed an evolutionary mechanism to explain the success of science,[15] which is much in line with Johnson-Laird's view that "induction is just something that animals, including human beings, do to make life possible",[13] but Popper did not consider it a part of his epistemology.[16] He wrote that his interest was mainly in the logic of science and that epistemology should be concerned with logical aspects only.[R] Instead of asking why science succeeds he considered the pragmatic problem of induction.[17] This problem is not how to justify a theory or what is the global mechanism for the success of science but only what methodology do we use to pick one theory among theories that are already conjectured.
