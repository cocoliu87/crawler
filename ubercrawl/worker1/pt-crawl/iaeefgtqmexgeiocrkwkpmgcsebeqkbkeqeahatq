It is administered by the Government of Catalonia and operated by the national rail operator Renfe Operadora.[3] The system consists of 17 service lines chiefly centred in the Barcelona area, serving a total of 203 stations throughout Catalonia, with an average number of 1,000 trains running on it every day. In 2016, it had an annual ridership of 117 million.[1] Most part of the system is the precursor of several commuter and regional lines running on the Iberian gauge mainline network in Catalonia, which were formerly under the administration of the Spanish government. On 1 January 2010 (2010-01-01), as a result of the transfer of the administration of the Cercanías commuter rail system for Barcelona, known in Catalan as Rodalies Barcelona, the system was renamed "Rodalies de Catalunya".[4] One year later, Renfe's regional rail services within Catalonia were included in the system after their administration had also been transferred.[5] In 2014, two new commuter rail services in Camp de Tarragona and the Girona area were created as part of the system on 20 and 24 March, respectively.[6][7] Rodalies de Catalunya, especially its Barcelona commuter rail service, has been criticised for its high number of incidents, normally resulting in delays, though some minor accidents involving injuries have also occurred.[8][9] The Catalan government has pointed out as their main cause poor investment in the system's infrastructure,[10] which is owned by Adif, a public agency of the Spanish government in charge of conventional (non-high-speed) rail infrastructure in the country.[11][12] Current system[edit] Barcelona commuter rail service[edit] Rodalies de Catalunya's Barcelona commuter rail service consists of eight lines serving a large part of the Barcelona metropolitan area, even extending out of its limits in some cases. Regardless of the Vic–Latour-de-Carol portion, it runs on 467 kilometres (290 mi) of railway lines and has 109 stations in 77 municipalities, accounting for a population of 4.7 million. It is calculated that the service has a daily ridership of 350,000 travelers and,[10] according to 2016 figures, an annual ridership of 108.3 million.[1] All lines (except line R8) are centred in the city of Barcelona, where they run on two underground trunk routes. Lines R3 and R4, and partly lines R1 and R7, use the Meridiana Tunnel, comprising Plaça de Catalunya, Arc de Triomf, La Sagrera-Meridiana and Sant Andreu Arenal stations. Contrarily, lines R2, R2 Nord and, partially, R2 Sud use the Aragó Tunnel, comprising Passeig de Gràcia and El Clot-Aragó stations. Both trunk routes converge at Barcelona Sants railway station, the service's main station.[13] Renfe created the Cercanías Barcelona/Rodalia Barcelona branding in 1979 with the aim of absorbing the traffic of passengers who enter and leave the Catalan capital every day. The system became one of the crown jewels of Renfe, however, the reality was that the network was in very poor condition and required modernisation. In 1984 Renfe was in a critical economic situation due to the high number of deficient lines, which is why it decided to close many of them, part of which were saved by the Autonomous Communities. There was a modernisation of facilities, especially in stations, to adapt to new needs. In 1989–1991 Renfe created separate business units, due to the deep reorganisation of the rail service at the state level and divided the operation into commuter trains, medium distances and long distances. In 1992 there were many works and transformations, one of the most relevant, the removal of the track between Estació de França and Sant Adrià de Besòs along the Barcelona seafront, and the diversion of Line R1 through La Sagrera and the purchase of rolling stock specially designed for commuter services. It can be considered that in 1992 the network is consolidated in the way we know it today. The current system is the precursor of former Renfe Operadora's Cercanías commuter rail system for Barcelona known as Rodalia Barcelona, and it has kept most of its features. Nevertheless, while all the other Cercanías systems around Spain use letter 'C' (from the Spanish word cercanías) plus a number for identifying their lines, Barcelona's commuter rail system uses letter 'R' instead (from its Catalan equivalent rodalia). As for the numbering, since Rodalies de Catalunya shares market with Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC) on the city's commuter rail, it can only use numbers from 1 to 10 leaving numbers 5 and 6 for FGC lines.[14] Since 22 July 2006 (2006-07-22), a line named R10 has been running between Barcelona–El Prat Airport and Barcelona's Estació de França.[15] However, due to construction works near Barcelona Sant Andreu Comtal railway station, a "temporary" restructuring of lines R2 and R10 was implemented on 31 January 2009 (2009-01-31); the R10 was suspended and the R2 was divided into three different lines—R2, R2 Nord ("North") and R2 Sud ("South"). The R10 was initially scheduled to resume services two years later.[16] On 26 June 2011 (2011-06-26), a restructuring of the service affecting several lines was implemented. It mainly involved the creation of new line R8, the first line ever bypassing Barcelona, and the rerouting of line R7. Before the restructuring, former line R7 ran from L'Hospitalet de Llobregat to Martorell via the Meridiana Tunnel in Barcelona's city centre and Rubí. With the rerouting, it was shortened and started to run as a shuttle line between Cerdanyola Universitat and Barcelona Sant Andreu Arenal stations. New line R8 took over the former route of line R7 between Martorell and Cerdanyola Universitat, then continuing towards Granollers Centre. Thanks to the changes applied on lines R7 and R8, it was able to increase frequencies with a train every 6 minutes and 8 minutes during rush hour on lines R1 and R4, respectively.[17][18] Typically, most trains call at all the stations on the line. Nevertheless, some trains on lines R2 Sud, R3 and R4 operate limited service and only call at certain stations. Furthermore, most trains on all lines, excepting lines R2, R7 and R8, operate partial services, being line R1 exclusively operated with partial services.

At the time it started services, it was the first commuter rail service in Catalonia not centered in Barcelona. The Camp de Tarragona commuter rail service consists of two lines, which are identified by letters 'RT' (the latter referring to Tarragona) plus a number, serving a total of 13 stations. Both lines converge at Tarragona railway station and are served by stopping trains only. Currently, it does not run on weekends. Line RT1 actually serves as a reinforcement for regional services between Tarragona and Reus with 9 additional trains in each direction, allowing a service pattern of approximately 30 minutes during rush hour and lower to one hour during off-peak time between  contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 55 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Rodalies_de_Catalunya responseCode 3 200
