February 29 Ricin in Vegas Ricin is found in a Las Vegas, Nevada, hotel room, hospitalizing 7 people. Oppose as nominator It's not exactly something you accidentally grow, but it's been ruled out as bio-terrorism. Perhaps it develops into something more interesting and someone writes a nice article about it... Madcoverboy (talk) 22:26, 29 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] The section needs to be updated in Ricin, as it is a single, vague sentence.

Support as nominator So I'm sure a lot of people here aren't big fans of military largesse, much less American military contracts. However this is a major upset for Boeing and involves a European consortium, so it's sufficiently international. It's also tied into a major scandal from 2003 involving a pork-barrel leasing program. Madcoverboy (talk) 01:22, 1 March 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] It appears that it will be designated the KC-45, even though there are other designations such as A330MRTT and KC-30A. Madcoverboy (talk) 01:32, 1 March 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Alright - I think I have it. The system was to be called the KC-45 regardless of the platform. The A330MRTT was recoded as the KC30 by Northrop.Madcoverboy (talk) 01:51, 1 March 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Seems like interesting stuff, but I'm not sure its really all that important, price tag notwithstanding. Weak oppose. Random89 (talk) 09:18, 1 March 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] February 28 William F. Buckleys death One of the most important political thinkers of the last half century died early Wednesday morning at his desk in his Stamford, Connecticut home. Buckley was the founder of the conservative magazine The National Review, and was instrumental in the emergence of modern conservatism in the United States. William F. Buckley, Jr., founder of The National Review and an influential conservative thinker, died in Stamford, Connecticut at the age of 83. (This is my first time writing one of these, so your help would be welcome! :) Judgesurreal777 (talk) 02:00, 29 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Sorry to say this won't be allowed on the main page as deaths have to be unexpected, it's to prevent the main page becoming a memorial -62.172.143.205 (talk) 02:59, 29 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] I follow my comments on the talk page when this was first suggested. We should not add any deaths until we resolve the death criteria, unless it is of major importance. This man's death isn't, it shouldn't go up. --Plasma Twa 2 (talk) 04:15, 29 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Support for 1 day I have no personal affinity for the man or his views, but per a thread we had on talk about increasing the churn on the template I think we should incorporate notable deaths like this for one day and then take them off. Madcoverboy (talk) 04:52, 29 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Have we ever done that? Have something up for a day? Not including the contested items that were taken off cause they shouldn't have been on there in the first place? --Plasma Twa 2 (talk) 04:58, 29 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Short answer, no. But it was an idea that was brought upon on Talk as a compromise over what some people believe to be an unnecessarily high death criterion with others' concerns that the page isn't dynamic enough. Granted, there a many, many notable people die every day but a special few might warrant 24 hours in the ITN sun. Madcoverboy (talk) 05:06, 29 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] I would argue that he is notable enough to be mentioned; as George Will once noted, Buckley was instrumental in winning the Cold War, which was the defining conflict of the last half century, so his passing is quite significent. Judgesurreal777 (talk) 21:30, 29 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Praaance Harry It is revealed by the Drudge Report that Prince Harry, the third in line to the British and Commonwealth throne, has been deployed with the Blues and Royals cavalry regiment in operations in Afghanistan since December 2007. Philip Stevens (talk) 19:31, 28 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Hm... it's been two months since he left to there. Weak oppose. --Tone 20:06, 28 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] It may have been two months since he got there, but the fact he was there was only announced today, following a media blackout. Support Kaid100 (talk) 22:17, 28 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Oppose. If he gets shot, then that is ITN worthy. But him arriving, two months ago, is not notable. ---CWY2190TC 22:36, 28 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] I agree, if something happened to him such as being injured in the line of duty or being captured, it would be newsworthy. A soldier fulfilling his duties is not news. Madcoverboy (talk) 12:45, 29 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Support. It was notable news when he first enlisted, and later when it said he wasn't going. Now that it is revealed he is there, it is important, or at least interest, to the Commonwealth countries. --Plasma Twa 2 (talk) 04:16, 29 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Support. He's been there 2 months, but it was just reported today. Calvin 1998 Talk Contribs 04:26, 29 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Oppose This isn't news, it's just idle infotainment - "look at what someone famous is doing!" Go to Entertainment Weekly or your preferred blog if you want this kind of tripe. Madcoverboy (talk) 04:40, 29 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] I think this counts a little more then whatever Paris Hilton is doing at the moment. --Plasma Twa 2 (talk) 04:57, 29 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Not infotainment, hes the first senior royal to fight on a battlefield since Queen Victoria’s grandson Prince Maurice in World War One Tgb25 (talk) 11:57, 29 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Support the fact that it was kept secret for 10 weeks adds to the notarity. In a time when the NYT exposes every tactic of the war on terror, British (and commonwealth) media are going out of the way making deals with the gov't to maintain the security. Especially poinent as his mother may have been killed due to overzealous paparazzi. And its far more notable than the Euro hitting an all time high. (Why it just might hit another high next month too.)--Lemmey (talk) 05:36, 29 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] While I remain neutral on the story, your comment seems to be missing the point. This wasn't a tactic, simply a person who was serving on the frontline. Revealing that he was would have put his life and the life of those around him at excesive risk but would have seemingly served no other purpose, there is no reason why the fact that he is serving needs to be scrutinised. This is quite different from the NYT revealing the use of controversial tactics such as waterboarding, extraordinary rendition, wiretaps not sanctioned by the juridiciary etc. A better example would be if Jenna and whatever Bush were serving on the front line. Also, the media blackout was from what I can tell, only ever intended to remain while he was there. Once he had left, it was always fair game. If I'm not mistaken, many media outlets in the US do agree to blackouts for their embedded reporters for example. P.S. This is I guess OR but perhaps most significantly, it seems likely that the media's decision to maintain a blackout was at least partially motivated by selfinterest. Any decision to report on the story, would have likely drawn a large amount of very negative flak (as we've already seen with New Idea). It may have generated a few days of hot sales, but beyond that it's unlikely it would have continued while the negativity would have remained. And it's unlikely a great amount of people would be congratulating them for their revelation since there was nothing significant or important about it. Nil Einne (talk) 12:37, 29 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Support, third in line on the frontline is news worthy. --Hera1187 (talk) 08:22, 29 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Support, Tour has now come to an end, and he is the first senior royal to fight on a battlefield since Queen Victoria’s grandson Prince Maurice in World War One.[1] Tgb25 (talk) 11:55, 29 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] So why haven't we covered John McCain's son's tour of duty in Iraq? Surely the presumptive Republican presidential candidate/world-famous Vietnam POW/big-name Senator is just as notable as the Queen? Wouldn't then his son too warrant coverage? It's a strawman argument, but it exposes the banality of the argument "someone famous is doing/did something!" Madcoverboy (talk) 12:40, 29 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] A WP:WAX argument is not a valid argument for non-inclusion. Tgb25 (talk) 16:09, 29 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Comment It doesn't appear to be true that Drudge broke the story or that it was kept secret for 2 months. It had been previously published in New Idea in early January and at least one German media source at some other time, a fact the Drudge report story apparently previously acknowledged [2]. However it does appear that the New Idea story didn't receive must attention and the Drudge report story was the one which forced it completely out into the open. Nil Einne (talk) 12:25, 29 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Comment It's been announced in the last few hours that Harry is being withdrawn from Afghanistan. Could this make the story more notable and in-the-present? How's this for the headline: "After 10 weeks, Prince Harry is withdrawn from the frontline in Afghanistan by the Ministry of Defence following the leaking of his posting by The Drud contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 80 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Wikipedia:In_the_news/Candidates/February_2008 responseCode 3 200
