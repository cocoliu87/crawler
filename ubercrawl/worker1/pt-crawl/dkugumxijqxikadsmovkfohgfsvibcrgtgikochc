Its use to record years began around the middle of the 3rd century BC.[2] The cycle and its variations have been an important part of the traditional calendrical systems in Chinese-influenced Asian states and territories, particularly those of Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, with the old Chinese system still in use in Taiwan, and to a lesser extent, in Mainland China.[3] This traditional method of numbering days and years no longer has any significant role in modern Chinese time-keeping or the official calendar. However, the sexagenary cycle is used in the names of many historical events, such as the Chinese Xinhai Revolution, the Japanese Boshin War, the Korean Imjin War and the Vietnamese Famine of Ất Dậu, Tết Mậu Thân. It also continues to have a role in contemporary Chinese astrology and fortune telling. There are some parallels in this with the current 60-year cycle of the Hindu calendar.

The first term jiǎzǐ (甲子) combines the first heavenly stem with the first earthly branch. The second term yǐchǒu (乙丑) combines the second stem with the second branch. This pattern continues until both cycles conclude simultaneously with guǐhài (癸亥), after which it begins again at jiǎzǐ. This termination at ten and twelve's least common multiple leaves half of the combinations—such as jiǎchǒu (甲丑)—unused; this is traditionally explained by reference to pairing the stems and branches according to their yin and yang properties. This combination of two sub-cycles to generate a larger cycle and its use to record time have parallels in other calendrical systems, notably the Akan calendar.[4] History[edit] Bone inscribed with a table of the sexagenary cycle, dated to the early 11th century BC The sexagenary cycle is attested as a method of recording days from the earliest written records in China, records of divination on oracle bones, beginning c. 1100 BC.[5] Almost every oracle bone inscription includes a date in this format. This use of the cycle for days is attested throughout the Zhou dynasty and remained common into the Han period for all documentary purposes that required dates specified to the day. Almost all the dates in the Spring and Autumn Annals, a chronological list of events from 722 to 481 BC, use this system in combination with regnal years and months (lunations) to record dates. Eclipses recorded in the Annals demonstrate that continuity in the sexagenary day-count was unbroken from that period onwards. It is likely that this unbroken continuity went back still further to the first appearance of the sexagenary cycle during the Shang period.[6] The use of the sexagenary cycle for recording years is much more recent. The earliest discovered documents showing this usage are among the silk manuscripts recovered from Mawangdui tomb 3, sealed in 168 BC. In one of these documents, a sexagenary grid diagram is annotated in three places to mark notable events. For example, the first year of the reign of Qin Shi Huang (秦始皇), 246 BC, is noted on the diagram next to the position of the 60-cycle term yǐ-mǎo (乙卯, 52 of 60), corresponding to that year.[7] [8] Use of the cycle to record years became widespread for administrative time-keeping during the Western Han dynasty (202 BC – 8 AD). The count of years has continued uninterrupted ever since:[9] the year 1984 began the present cycle (a 甲子—jiǎ-zǐ year), and 2044 will begin another. Note that in China the new year, when the sexagenary count increments, is not January 1, but rather the lunar new year of the traditional Chinese calendar. For example, the ji-chou 己丑 year (coinciding roughly with 2009) began on January 26, 2009. (However, for astrology, the year begins with the first solar term "Lìchūn" (立春), which occurs near February 4.) In Japan, according to Nihon shoki, the calendar was transmitted to Japan in 553. But it was not until the Suiko era that the calendar was used for politics. The year 604, when the Japanese officially adopted the Chinese calendar, was the first year of the cycle.[10] The Korean (환갑; 還甲 hwangap) and Japanese tradition (還暦 kanreki) of celebrating the 60th birthday (literally 'return of calendar') reflects the influence of the sexagenary cycle as a count of years.[11] The Tibetan calendar also counts years using a 60-year cycle based on 12 animals and 5 elements, but while the first year of the Chinese cycle is always the year of the Wood Rat, the first year of the Tibetan cycle is the year of the Fire Rabbit (丁卯—dīng-mǎo, year 4 on the Chinese cycle).[12] Ten Heavenly Stems[edit] Main article: Celestial Stems No. Heavenly Stem Chinese name Japanese name Korean name Vietnamese name Yin Yang Wu Xing Mandarin (Pinyin) Cantonese (Jyutping) Middle Chinese (Baxter) Old Chinese (Baxter–Sagart) Onyomi Kunyomi with corresponding kanji Romanized Hangul 1 甲 jiǎ gaap3 kæp *[k]ˤr[a]p kō (こう) kinoe (木の兄) gap 갑 giáp yang wood 2 乙 yǐ jyut3 ʔit *qrət otsu (おつ) kinoto (木の弟) eul 을 ất yin 3 丙 bǐng bing2 pjængX *praŋʔ hei (へい) hinoe (火の兄) byeong 병 bính yang fire 4 丁 dīng ding1 teng *tˤeŋ tei (てい) hinoto (火の弟) jeong 정 đinh yin 5 戊 wù mou6 muwH *m(r)uʔ-s (~ *m(r)uʔ) bo (ぼ) tsuchinoe (土の兄) mu 무 mậu yang earth 6 己 jǐ gei2 kiX *k(r)əʔ ki (き) tsuchinoto (土の弟) gi 기 kỷ yin 7 庚 gēng gang1 kæng *kˤraŋ kō (こう) kanoe (金の兄) gyeong 경 canh yang metal 8 辛 xīn san1 sin *si[n] shin (しん) kanoto (金の弟) sin 신 tân yin 9 壬 rén jam4 nyim *n[ə]m jin (じん) mizunoe (水の兄) im 임 nhâm yang water 10 癸 guǐ gwai3 kjwijX *kʷijʔ ki (き) mizunoto (水の弟) gye 계 quý yin Twelve Earthly Branches[edit] Main article: Terrestrial Branches No. Earthly Branch Chinese name Japanese name Korean name Vietnamese name Vietnamese zodiac Chinese zodiac Corresponding hours Mandarin (Pinyin) Cantonese (Jyutping) Middle Chinese (Baxter) Old Chinese (Baxter–Sagart) Onyomi Kunyomi Romanized Hangul 1 子 zǐ zi2 tsiX *[ts]əʔ shi (し) ne (ね) ja 자 tý Rat (chuột 𤝞) Rat (鼠) 11 p.m. to 1 a.m. 2 丑 chǒu cau2 trhjuwX *[n̥]ruʔ chū (ちゅう) ushi (うし) chuk 축 sửu Water buffalo (trâu 𤛠) Ox (牛) 1 to 3 a.m. 3 寅 yín jan4 yij *[ɢ] (r)ər in (いん) tora (とら) in 인 dần Tiger (hổ 虎/cọp 𧲫) Tiger (虎) 3 to 5 a.m. 4 卯 mǎo maau5 mæwX *mˤruʔ bō (ぼう) u (う) myo 묘 mão/mẹo Cat (mèo 猫) Rabbit (兔) 5 to 7 a.m. 5 辰 chén san4 dzyin *[d]ər shin (しん) tatsu (たつ) jin 진 thìn Dragon (rồng 龍) Dragon (龍) 7 to 9 a.m. 6 巳 sì zi6 ziX *s-[ɢ]əʔ shi (し) mi (み) sa 사 tỵ Snake (rắn 𧋻) Snake (蛇) 9 to 11 a.m. 7 午 wǔ ng5 nguX *[m].qʰˤaʔ go (ご) uma (うま) o 오 ngọ Horse (ngựa 馭) Horse (馬) 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. 8 未 wèi mei6 mjɨjH *m[ə]t-s mi (み) or bi (び) hitsuji (ひつじ) mi 미 mùi Goat (dê 羝) Goat (羊) 1 to 3 p.m. 9 申 shēn san1 syin *l̥i[n] shin (しん) saru (さる) sin 신 thân Monkey (khỉ 𤠳) Monkey (猴) 3 to 5 p.m. 10 酉 yǒu jau5 yuwX *N-ruʔ yū (ゆう) tori (とり) yu 유 dậu Rooster (gà 𪂮) Rooster (雞) 5 to 7 p.m. 11 戌 xū seot1 swit *s.mi[t] jutsu (じゅつ) inu (いぬ) sul 술 tuất Dog (chó 㹥) Dog (狗) 7 to 9 p.m. 12 亥 hài hoi6 hojX *[g]ˤəʔ gai (がい) i (い) hae 해 hợi Pig (lợn 𤞼/heo 㺧) Pig (豬) 9 to 11 p.m. *The names of several animals can be translated into English in several different ways.
