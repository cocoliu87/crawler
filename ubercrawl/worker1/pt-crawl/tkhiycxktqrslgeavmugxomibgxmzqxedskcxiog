Size Height: 23 cm (9.1 in) Width: 12 cm (4.7 in) Created 9th or 10th century Refurbished in the 15th century Period/culture Early Medieval, Insular Discovered Before 1682 Templecross, County Westmeath, Ireland Present location National Museum of Ireland, Dublin Identification NMI 1887:145[1] The Corp Naomh ([kɔɾˠpˠ n̪ˠiːvˠ], KORP NEEV, English: Holy or Sacred Body) is an Irish bell shrine made in the 9th or 10th century to enclose a now-lost hand-bell, which probably dated to c. 600 to 900 AD and belonged to an early Irish saint. The shrine was rediscovered sometime before 1682 at Tristernagh Abbey, near Templecross, County Westmeath. The shrine is 23 cm (9.1 in) high and 12 cm (4.7 in) wide. It was heavily refurbished and added to during a second phase of embellishment in the 15th century, and now consists of cast and sheet bronze plates mounted on a wooden core decorated with silver, niello and rock crystal. It is severely damaged with extensive losses and wear across almost all of its parts, and when discovered a block of wood had been substituted for the bell itself. The remaining elements are considered of high historical and artistic value by archeologists and art historians. Sections from its original, early Medieval phase include the cross on the reverse and the ornate semi-circular cap, which shows a bearded cleric holding a book. He is surrounded by horsemen above whom are large birds seemingly about to take flight. It was extensively refurbished in the 15th (and possibly 16th) centuries when the central bronze crucifix, the griffin and lion panel, the stamped border panels and the backing plate were added. The badly damaged crucifix and large enamel stud on the front date from at least the 15th century. The shrine's medieval provenance is incomplete. It was probably held by hereditary keepers after the dissolution of Tristernagh Abbey in 1536 until it passed into the possession of the Anglo-Irish owners of the site. The Corp Naomh was first exhibited in 1853 by the Royal Irish Academy (RIA) and was transferred to the National Museum of Ireland in 1887. Discovery and provenance[edit] The Corp Naomh was rediscovered sometime before 1682[2] on the grounds of the now ruined Tristernagh Abbey in Templecross, County Westmeath, founded c. 1200 as an Augustinian priory.[3] It is first mentioned and described in Henry Piers' Chorographical Description of the County of Westmeath (written 1682, published 1770). Piers (1629–1691) was a MP, antiquarian and the owner of the land on which the abbey was located. Although recognising the object as a reliquary, Piers assumed it to have been a container for a small manuscript.[4] When finally opened it was found to contain a block of wood, which is now presumed by archeologists to have been a substitute for a saint's hand-bell,[2][5] and was presumably left in place to prevent the metal's inward collapse.[6] Ruins of Tristernagh Abbey The shrine's cap and crest date to the 11th or 12th centuries; the crucifixion and other parts of the main face are 15th-century additions. Although its early medieval provenance is unknown, it is generally accepted that the early modern additions were completed at Tristernagh, where it was located when brought to the attention of Piers. Historians consider it probable that the priory invested in upgrading the shrine to redeem and re-establish itself after it faced charges of treason in 1468 "for joining with Irish enemies and English rebels in raiding and burning the town of Taghmon and in destroying many of the king's loyal subjects".[3] Little is known of its early modern provenance. It was probably held by hereditary keepers after the 1536 dissolution of the abbey.[7][8] Piers received the shrine at Tristernagh from an unidentified man he described as "a certain gentleman, a great zealot of the Romish Church".[5] Cautious not to damage the structure, he did not open the shrine (it was first opened in the late 19th century), but suspected that it contained "a bible of the smaller volume" (ie a "pocket bible" or pocket gospel book). He wrote that "whether it have anything hidden within it, is known I believe to no man living, but it ... is held to this day in great veneration by all of the Romanish persuasion that live hereabout".[2] Piers recorded that the shrine had an on-going tradition of use for swearing oaths, and noted that it was held in reverence and was of such "peculiar solemnity" that any man who "delivered falsehoods ... is sure to be visited in some dreadful manner".[9] The Corp Naomh was first exhibited at the Irish Industrial Exhibition world's fair held in Cork in 1852,[10] where it was shown alongside recently discovered Insular artworks such as the Cathach, Saint Manchan's Shrine and the Cross of Cong.[11] It was acquired c. 1868 for £21 by the Royal Irish Academy (RIA) from Messrs. Hodges Figgis & Co. of Grafton Street, Dublin,[10] before it was bequeathed in 1887 to the National Museum of Ireland.[12] Function[edit] Main article: Bell shrine St. Patrick's bell, c. 500; enshrined c. 1100 Hand-bells were primarily used in early Medieval Ireland to call monks to prayer, and over time those associated with a saint became insignia of clerical office. By 1100 the more important bells from the 600–900 period were treated as relics, having the perceived ability to heal sickness, secure oaths or grant fortune.[13] A few were preserved in the late 11th and early 12th centuries, during a period when the enshrinement of relics by the highest-ranking metalworkers was at its height. Like Cumdachs (book-shaped reliquaries) and house-shaped shrines, bell-shrines are essentially metal containers. Most embellished bell coverings, including the Corp Naomh, follow the general shape of a tubular hand-bell and are capped with a semicircular crest outlining the shape of a handle.[14] The "Corp Naomh" title is modern and translates from Irish as the "sacred (or holy) body".[4][11] The wording is based on the large central figure of Jesus on the cross.[15] At 23 cm (9.1 in) high, the shrine is around the size of a pocket bible and until the mid-19th century was assumed to be a container for a manuscript.[9] Its shape and size fall within the archeologist Cormac Bourke's "Class 1" classification of hand-bells; that is bells produced between 600 and 900 of iron coated with bronze, largely in the west-midlands of Ireland.[16][17] Description[edit] The shrine is 23 cm (9.1 in) high and 12 cm (4.7 in) wide.[18] It consists of a bronze sheet and cast metal protruding mounts attached to a slim wooden core. The semi-circular cap and crest at the top and the nielloed bronze cross on the main body of the reverse date from the 9th or 10th century.[19] The stamped side-border panels are 15th-century, and the crucifixion and oval crystal on the front are possibly 16th-century.[15][20][21] Cap and crest[edit] The semicircular cap is 12 cm (4.7 in) high. It consists of a hollow bronze casting decorated front and back with human and animal figures, with an openwork crest running along its upper border. The front side contains a bearded cleric surrounded by horsemen and birds, and the reverse shows two confronted animals and foliate coils.[22] Although the reverse was once as decorated as the front, it is now severely damaged and has significant losses.[23] The shape of the reverse echoes that of the front, but contains an extra border between the crest and figurative panels, composed of hatched bands.[19] It contains a series of much thinner confronted animals with hind legs extending forwards.[1] The crest is of bronze and decorated on both sides with three-loop running-knot interlace patterns in openwork[24] and lined at the top with a plain-ridge upper-border.[19] Cleric[edit] Detail of the cleric with riders, horses and birds to his left and right. The crest's interlaced patterns can be seen at the top. The cap is dominated by a central figure standing in full-face profile.[25] His body reaches the full-length of the cap and the top is within the crest and the back of his head protrudes into the reverse.[24] He is assumed to be an ecclesiastic based on his clothing, the fact he is holding a book, and that he is partially bald – a contemporary short-hand for indicating clerics or monks.[26] Given his similarities to the figures on the 11th-century Soiscél Molaisse reliquary, several scholars have suggested that he is one of the Four Evangelists.[27][28] The figure is in low relief and poor condition: his face is badly worn and his lower body contains three large puncture holes from later rivets.[29][30] The remaining discernable facial features include his mouth and nose, one eye, and his beard.[19] He wears a full-length and according to Bourke a "wing-like" tunic or cloak rendered with cross hatching on enamel and niello, and an undergarment with similar borders at the lower hem.[31] Raised diagonal bands divide the robe into four sections, between which are decorative panels containing incised (marked with cuts) herringbone, basket-weaved hatched and chevron patterns.[19] His shoes have pointed toes, high tongues and elaborate ankles; a triquetra knot design is placed above each foot. The pattern between his legs was probably a ring-knot, but is now punctured by a rivet hole.[19] His shoulders have circular ornaments and cross hatchings resembling early versions of the Orthodox cross. The 19th-century historian William Frazer described these and their "equal-rayed limbs" as an examples of the then "popular and universally worn" Patrick's Cross type, which he said were "distinctive emblems of Christian teaching ... [that were a] recognised badge of those who possessed rank in the Celtic churches".[31] Other early works containing similar designs include figures on a stone cross from Meigle, Scotlan contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 44 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Corp_Naomh responseCode 3 200
