Since the end of the Second World War, it has been a major centre for international politics and home to numerous international organisations, politicians, diplomats and civil servants.[22] Brussels is the de facto capital of the European Union, as it hosts a number of principal EU institutions, including its administrative-legislative, executive-political, and legislative branches (though the judicial branch is located in Luxembourg, and the European Parliament meets for a minority of the year in Strasbourg).[23][24][c] Because of this, its name is sometimes used metonymically to describe the EU and its institutions.[25][26] The secretariat of the Benelux and the headquarters of NATO are also located in Brussels.[27][28] As the economic capital of Belgium and a top financial centre of Western Europe with Euronext Brussels, Brussels is classified as an Alpha global city.[29] It is also a national and international hub for rail, road and air traffic,[30] and are sometimes considered, together with Belgium, as the geographic, economic and cultural crossroads of Europe.[31][32][33] The Brussels Metro is the only rapid transit system in Belgium. In addition, both its airport and railway stations are the largest and busiest in the country.[34][35] Historically Dutch-speaking, Brussels saw a language shift to French from the late 19th century.[36] Nowadays, the Brussels-Capital Region is officially bilingual in French and Dutch,[37][38] although French is the majority language and lingua franca with over 90% of the inhabitants being able to speak it.[39][40] Brussels is also increasingly becoming multilingual. English is spoken as a second language by nearly a third of the population and many migrants and expatriates speak other languages as well.[39][41] Brussels is known for its cuisine and gastronomic offer (including its local waffle, its chocolate, its French fries and its numerous types of beers),[42] as well as its historical and architectural landmarks; some of them are registered as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[43] Principal attractions include its historic Grand-Place/Grote Markt (main square), Manneken Pis, the Atomium, and cultural institutions such as La Monnaie/De Munt and the Museums of Art and History. Due to its long tradition of Belgian comics, Brussels is also hailed as a capital of the comic strip.[1][44] Toponymy[edit] See also: Names of European cities in different languages (B) Etymology[edit] The most common theory of the origin of the name Brussels is that it derives from the Old Dutch Bruocsella, Broekzele or Broeksel, meaning 'marsh' (bruoc / broek) and 'home, settlement' (sella / zele / sel) or 'settlement in the marsh'.[45][46] Saint Vindicianus, the Bishop of Cambrai, made the first recorded reference to the place Brosella in 695,[47] when it was still a hamlet. The names of all the municipalities in the Brussels-Capital Region are also of Dutch origin, except for Evere, which is Celtic. Pronunciation[edit] In French, Bruxelles is pronounced [bʁysɛl] ⓘ (the x is pronounced /s/, like in English, and the final s is silent) and in Dutch, Brussel is pronounced [ˈbrʏsəl] ⓘ. Inhabitants of Brussels are known in French as Bruxellois (pronounced [bʁysɛlwa] ⓘ) and in Dutch as Brusselaars (pronounced [ˈbrʏsəlaːrs]). In the Brabantian dialect of Brussels (known as Brusselian, and also sometimes referred to as Marols or Marollien),[48] they are called Brusseleers or Brusseleirs.[49] Originally, the written x noted the group /ks/. In the Belgian French pronunciation as well as in Dutch, the k eventually disappeared and z became s, as reflected in the current Dutch spelling, whereas in the more conservative French form, the spelling remained.[50] The pronunciation /ks/ in French only dates from the 18th century, but this modification did not affect the traditional Brussels usage. In France, the pronunciations [bʁyksɛl] ⓘ and [bʁyksɛlwa] (for bruxellois) are often heard, but are rather rare in Belgium.[51] History[edit] For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Brussels.

The history of Brussels is closely linked to that of Western Europe. Traces of human settlement go back to the Stone Age, with vestiges and place-names related to the civilisation of megaliths, dolmens and standing stones (Plattesteen near the Grand-Place/Grote Markt and Tomberg in Woluwe-Saint-Lambert, for example). During late antiquity, the region was home to Roman occupation, as attested by archaeological evidence discovered on the current site of Tour & Taxis, north-west of the Pentagon (Brussels' city centre).[52][53] Following the decline of the Western Roman Empire, it was incorporated into the Frankish Empire. According to local legend, the origin of the settlement which was to become Brussels lies in Saint Gaugericus' construction of a chapel on an island in the river Senne around 580.[54] The official founding of Brussels is usually said to be around 979, when Duke Charles of Lower Lorraine transferred the relics of the martyr Saint Gudula from Moorsel (located in today's province of East Flanders) to Saint Gaugericus' chapel. When King Lothair II appointed the same Charles (his brother) to become Duke of Lower Lotharingia in 977, Charles ordered the construction of the city's first permanent fortification, doing so on that same island. Middle Ages[edit] Lambert I of Leuven, Count of Leuven, gained the County of Brussels around 1000, by marrying Charles' daughter.
