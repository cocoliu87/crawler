It is a generally accepted standard that editors should attempt to follow, though occasional exceptions may apply. Any substantive edit to this page should reflect consensus. When in doubt, discuss first on the talk page. Shortcuts WP:ITN/R WP:ITNR This page in a nutshell: The recurring events listed on this page are considered suitable for inclusion on the Main Page in the In the news section every time they occur. Other recurring events may also be included if they satisfy the usual ITN criteria. In the news toolbox Error reports Nominations (Archives) Discussion General criteria Death criteria Recurring items Admin guide Image protection Current events portal v t e This page is a supplement to the existing criteria for the In the news (ITN) section on the Main Page. There is frequent discussion about the recurring events on ITN – this guideline is an attempt to standardize which get included. Scheduled sporting events and other recurring items are different from other ITN candidates because editors can foresee them and prepare for their inclusion. There is no reason not to have a pre-existing list of approved events. Such a list also assists editors in ensuring a reasonably balanced coverage (of for example, different sports) over time. Items which are listed on this page are considered to have already satisfied the 'importance' criterion for inclusion on ITN, every time they occur. However, the relevant article(s) will still have to be updated appropriately and proposed on the candidates page before being posted. Listing here is not an automatic guarantee that an item will be posted. In addition, as is the case with all other ITN items, the posting of a recurring item can be weighed against whether Wikipedia would be best served in its inclusion. Suggestions for new recurring items should be discussed and gain consensus at WT:ITN. Similarly, changes or removals from this list should be proposed at WT:ITN. This page does not pre-empt other ITN criteria regarding inclusion. Unusual and particularly important events not listed here may also be included.

In terms of timing, events are generally posted as soon as a winner is determined. Generally, the specific event article for that year/time period is the target article in the blurb (for example, 2016 Tour de France rather than the broader Tour de France); winning individuals or teams may be targets but their articles must meet the same ITN quality requirements as the event.
