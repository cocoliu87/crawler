After arriving at the location, the house and its surroundings start to evoke painful memories in Iida, who has experienced mistreatment and forced assimilation into Finnish culture due to her Sámi descent. Iida's mind dives deeper into the secrets of the past and she rediscovers her true self, Jeʹvida.[9] Cast[edit] Agafia Niemenmaa as young Jeʹvida Heidi Uʹlljan Gauriloff as the young adult Jeʹvida/Iida Sanna-Kaisa Palo as the older Jeʹvida/Iida Heini Wesslin as Jeʹvida's mother Erkki Gauriloff as Jeʹvida's grandfather Matleena Fofonoff as Jeʹvida's grandmother Jarkko Lahti as the teacher Seidi Haarla as Sanna [4][9] Reception[edit] The film had its world premiere in June 2023 at the Tribeca Festival in New York.[9][10][4][11][12] The film was also shown at the Toronto Film Festival in September of the same year.[13] It was one of three Sámi films present at the festival.[14] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 83% of 6 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.10/10.[15] Aki Lehti from Muropaketti [fi] gives the film a rating of 4½ stars out of 5, saying that the film is a "sadly beautiful and touching work of art, a really necessary film about a silent subject."[16] Niina Oisalo of Film-O-Holic [fi] gives 4 stars out of 5, describing the film as "a skillfully executed magical realist drama", adding that "the film's breathy, natural rhythm brings out the bonds that unite generations without unnecessary explanation."[17] Niko Ikonen from Episodi [fi] gives the film 3 stars out of 5, comparing the film's subject to the 2016 Swedish film Sami Blood, saying that "unfortunately, Jeʹvida doesn't really get its message across, and the film's script does not support the weight of such a heavy and multifaceted subject."[18] See also[edit] List of Finnish films of the 2020s Sámi films Skolts References[edit] ^ a b Schroeder, Kira.
