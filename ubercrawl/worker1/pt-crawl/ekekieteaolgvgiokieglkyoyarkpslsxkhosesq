They employed missiles and Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), some of which were subsequently intercepted by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) over the Red Sea using the Arrow missile defense system; others fell short of their targets or were intercepted by the United States Navy and the Israeli Air Force. Background The Houthi movement is a Shiite militant organization that controls northern Yemen and is supported and funded by Iran,[1] and reportedly serves as their proxy in regional wars.[2] The movement's slogan is "Death to America, Death to Israel, Curse the Jews, Victory to Islam."[3] After the outbreak of the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, militant groups across the Middle East, including the Houthis, expressed support for the Palestinians and threatened to attack Israel. Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi warned the United States against intervening, threatening retaliation with drones and missiles.[4] Types of weapons used by the Houthis Houthi weapons come mainly from Iran.[2] They are known to use surface-to-surface missiles, artillery rockets and UAVs.[5] They have several missiles and UAVs capable of reaching Israel from Yemen: Toufan – a Surface-to-surface missile, with a range of 1,800 km.[6] Cruise missiles – from the Iranian Soumar family, with strike ranges of about 2,000 km.[6] Quds-2 missile – supposedly with a range of 1,350 km but made to strike Israel.[7] 3-Samad and 4-Samad – attack UAVs with ranges of 1,800+ km.[7] Wa’id drones – similar to Iran's Shahed 136, attack UAV with a range of 2,500 km.[7] Events Further information: Taba and Nuweiba drone attacks From 19 October to 9 November 2023, the Houthis carried out six attacks aimed towards Israel. USS Carney engages Houthi missiles On 19 October 2023, the U.S. Navy warship USS Carney shot down three land-attack cruise missiles and several drones heading toward Israel launched by the Houthis in Yemen. This was the first action by the U.S. military to defend Israel since the outbreak of the war.[4] It was later reported that the ship shot down four cruise missiles and 15 drones.[8] Another missile was reportedly intercepted by Saudi Arabia.[9] On 27 October 2023, two drones were fired in a northerly direction from the southern Red Sea. According to IDF officials, their target was Israel, but they did not cross the border from Egypt. Of the two drones, one fell short and hit a building adjacent to a hospital in Taba, Egypt, injuring six; the other was shot down near an electricity plant close to the town of Nuweiba, Egypt.[10][11][12] A Houthi official later made a one-word post on Twitter after the drone crashed in Taba, mentioning the nearby Israeli town of "Eilat".[13] On 31 October, an alert was triggered in Eilat, Eilot and the Shahorit industrial park area regarding the penetration of hostile aircraft from the Red Sea. The aircraft was successfully intercepted over the Red Sea. The Arrow system intercepted a ballistic missile and the Air Force intercepted several cruise missiles fired from the Red Sea towards Eilat. The Houthis took responsibility for the launches.[14] One cruise missile was shot down by an F-35i Adir jet.[15] The downing of the missile by the Arrow marks the first time it has been used in the Israel–Hamas war.[16] On 1 November at 0:45, the IDF intercepted an air threat fired from Yemen and identified south of Eilat.[17] A U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone was shot down off the coast of Yemen by Houthi air defences on 8 November; the Pentagon previously claimed MQ-9 drones were flying over Gaza in an intelligence gathering role to aid in the hostage recovery efforts.[18] On 9 November, the Houthis fired a missile towards the city of Eilat.[19] The missile was intercepted by an "Arrow 3" missile, marking the first time it was used in an interception.[20] On 14 November, the Houthis fired numerous missiles, one of which was aimed towards the city of Eilat. The missile was intercepted by an Arrow missile.[21] The following day, the USS Thomas Hudner shot down a drone that was headed towards it.[22] Hijacking of Galaxy Leader Galaxy Leader On 19 November, the Israeli chartered ship Galaxy Leader was hijacked by the Houthi militia in the Red Sea, with 25 individuals onboard. The incident followed a statement by Houthi spokesman Yahya Sarea on the group's Telegram channel, declaring their intention to target ships owned, operated by Israeli companies, or carrying the Israeli flag.[23] Sarea also urged countries to remove their citizens from crews of such ships. Earlier, Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Houthi had threatened further attacks against Israeli interests, including potential targets in the Red Sea and the Bab al-Mandeb Strait. His speech emphasized the group's capability to monitor and target Israeli ships in these regions.[23] Responses In a speech at a manufacturing exposition following the incident of 27 October, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi urged all parties in the 2023 Israel–Hamas War to respect Egypt's sovereignty, and emphasized that the Egyptian Army was able to protect the country in case of any more attacks.[24] See also 2023 attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria International reactions to the 2023 Israel–Hamas war References ^ Bayoumy, Yara; Ghobari, Mohammed (15 December 2014).
