Byatt, published by Chatto & Windus in 1996. It was the third part in a tetralogy,[1] following The Virgin in the Garden (1978) and Still Life (1985) and preceding A Whistling Woman (2002).[1][2] In the interval between publication of Still Life and Babel Tower, Byatt published Possession: A Romance, her best-selling novel, which won the 1990 Booker Prize.[3] References[edit] ^ a b Brace, Marianne (9 June 1996).

The Virgin in the Garden had appeared in 1978, and Still Life in 1985, but with Babel Tower (1996) and A Whistling Woman (2002) still to come, the quartet was taking you some time to complete. ASB: Most of the gap was caused by the death of my son. I went to teach at University College simply to pay his school fees, and he got killed the week I accepted the job. I wouldn't have otherwise become a teacher, I wanted to become a writer. Added to which I was pregnant, so the slowness of the novels, given a full-time university job, a new baby and a dead child can be put as a flat, autobiographical narrative... There were two things going on in my mind: one was that I knew that Babel Tower, the third in the quartet, ought to be a parodic novel in several voices, and I thought that I wasn't technically skilled enough.
