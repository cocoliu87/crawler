For the method of teaching how to read, see synthetic phonics. "Portmanteau" redirects here. For other uses, see Portmanteau (disambiguation). In linguistics, a blend—sometimes known, perhaps more narrowly, as a blend word, lexical blend, portmanteau (/pɔːrtˈmæntoʊ/ ⓘ port-MAN-toh or /ˌpɔːr(t)mænˈtoʊ/ POR(T)-man-TOH; pl. portmanteaux), or portmanteau word—is a word formed, usually intentionally, by combining the sounds and meanings of two or more words.[1][2][3] English examples include smog, coined by blending smoke and fog,[2][4] as well as motel, from motor (motorist) and hotel.[5] The component word fragments within blends are called splinters. A blend is similar to a contraction, but contractions are formed, usually non-intentionally, from words whose sounds gradually drift together over time due to them commonly appearing together in sequence, such as do not naturally becoming don't. A blend also differs from a compound, which fully preserves the stems of the original words. The 1973 Introduction to Modern English Word-Formation explains that "In words such as motel, boatel and Lorry-Tel, hotel is represented by various shorter substitutes – ‑otel, ‑tel, or ‑el – which I shall call splinters. Words containing splinters I shall call blends".[6][n 1] Thus, at least one of the parts of a blend, strictly speaking, is not a complete morpheme, but instead a mere splinter or leftover word fragment. For instance, starfish is a compound, not a blend, of star and fish, as it includes both words in full. However, if it were called a "stish" or a "starsh", it would be a blend. Furthermore, when blends are formed by shortening established compounds or phrases, they can be considered clipped compounds, such as romcom for romantic comedy.[7] Classification[edit] Blends of two or more words may be classified from each of three viewpoints: morphotactic, morphonological, and morphosemantic.[8] Morphotactic classification[edit] Blends may be classified morphotactically into two kinds: total and partial.[8] Total blends[edit] In a total blend, each of the words creating the blend is reduced to a mere splinter.[8] Some linguists limit blends to these (perhaps with additional conditions): for example, Ingo Plag considers "proper blends" to be total blends that semantically are coordinate, the remainder being "shortened compounds".[9] Commonly for English blends, the beginning of one word is followed by the end of another: breakfast + lunch → brunch [n 2] Much less commonly in English, the beginning of one word may be followed by the beginning of another: teleprinter + exchange → telex [n 2] American + Indian → Amerind [n 2] Some linguists do not regard beginning+beginning concatenations as blends, instead calling them complex clippings,[10] clipping compounds[11] or clipped compounds.[12] Unusually in English, the end of one word may be followed by the end of another: Red Bull + margarita → bullgarita [n 2] Hello Kitty + delicious → kittylicious [n 2] A splinter of one word may replace part of another, as in three coined by Lewis Carroll in "Jabberwocky": chuckle + snort → chortle [n 2] slimy + lithe → slithy [n 2] They are sometimes termed intercalative blends; these words are among the original "portmanteaus" for which this meaning of the word was created. [13] Partial blends[edit] In a partial blend, one entire word is concatenated with a splinter from another.[8] Some linguists do not recognize these as blends.[14] An entire word may be followed by a splinter: dumb + confound → dumbfound [n 2] fan + magazine → fanzine [n 3] A splinter may be followed by an entire word: Brad + Angelina → Brangelina [n 2] American + Indian → Amerindian [n 2] An entire word may replace part of another: adorable + dork → adorkable [n 2] disgusting + gross → disgrossting [n 2] These have also been called sandwich words,[15] and classed among intercalative blends.[13] (When two words are combined in their entirety, the result is considered a compound word rather than a blend. For example, bagpipe is a compound, not a blend, of bag and pipe.) Morphonological classification[edit] Morphonologically, blends fall into two kinds: overlapping and non-overlapping.[8] Overlapping blends[edit] Overlapping blends are those for which the ingredients' consonants, vowels or even syllables overlap to some extent. The overlap can be of different kinds.[8] These are also called haplologic blends.[16] There may be an overlap that is both phonological and orthographic, but with no other shortening: anecdote + dotage → anecdotage [n 2] pal + alimony → palimony [n 2] The overlap may be both phonological and orthographic, and with some additional shortening to at least one of the ingredients: California + fornication → Californication [n 4] picture + dictionary → pictionary [n 2] Such an overlap may be discontinuous: politician + pollution → pollutician [n 5] beef + buffalo → beefalo [n 2] These are also termed imperfect blends.[17][18] It can occur with three components: camisade + cannibalism + ballistics → camibalistics [n 6] meander + Neanderthal + tale → meandertale [n 6] The phonological overlap need not also be orthographic: back + acronym → backronym [n 2] war + orgasm → wargasm [n 2] If the phonological but non-orthographic overlap encompasses the whole of the shorter ingredient, as in sin + cinema → sinema [n 2] sham + champagne → shampagne [n 2] then the effect depends on orthography alone. (They are also called orthographic blends.[19]) An orthographic overlap need not also be phonological: smoke + fog → smog [n 2] binary + unit → bit [n 2] For some linguists, an overlap is a condition for a blend.[20] Non-overlapping blends[edit] Non-overlapping blends (also called substitution blends) have no overlap, whether phonological or orthographic: California + Mexico → Calexico [n 2] beautiful + delicious → beaulicious [n 4] Morphosemantic classification[edit] Morphosemantically, blends fall into two kinds: attributive and coordinate.[8] Attributive blends[edit] Attributive blends (also called syntactic or telescope blends) are those in which one of the ingredients is the head and the other is attributive. A porta-light is a portable light, not a 'light-emitting' or light portability; light is the head. A snobject is a snobbery-satisfying object and not an objective or other kind of snob; object is the head.[8] As is also true for (conventional, non-blend) attributive compounds (among which bathroom, for example, is a kind of room, not a kind of bath), the attributive blends of English are mostly head-final and mostly endocentric. As an example of an exocentric attributive blend, Fruitopia may metaphorically take the buyer to a fruity utopia (and not a utopian fruit); however, it is not a utopia but a drink. Coordinate blends[edit] Coordinate blends (also called associative or portmanteau blends) combine two words having equal status, and have two heads. Thus brunch is neither a breakfasty lunch nor a lunchtime breakfast but instead some hybrid of breakfast and lunch; Oxbridge is equally Oxford and Cambridge universities. This too parallels (conventional, non-blend) compounds: an actor–director is equally an actor and a director.[8] Two kinds of coordinate blends are particularly conspicuous: those that combine (near‑) synonyms: gigantic + enormous → ginormous insinuation + innuendo → insinuendo and those that combine (near‑) opposites: transmitter + receiver → transceiver friend + enemy → frenemy Blending of two roots[edit] Blending can also apply to roots rather than words, for instance in Israeli Hebrew: רמז (√rmz, 'hint') + אור (or, 'light') → רמזור (ramzor, 'traffic light') מגדל (migdal, 'tower') + אור (or, 'light') → מגדלור (migdalor, 'lighthouse') Mishnaic Hebrew: דחפ (√dħp, 'push') + Biblical Hebrew: חפר (√ħpr, 'dig') → דחפור (dakhpór, 'bulldozer') Israeli שלטוט shiltút 'zapping, surfing the channels, flipping through the channels' derives from (i) (Hebrew>) Israeli שלט shalát 'remote control', an ellipsis – like English remote (but using the noun instead) – of the (widely known) compound שלט רחוק shalát rakhók – cf. the Academy of the Hebrew Language's שלט רחק shalát rákhak; and (ii) (Hebrew>) Israeli שטוט shitút 'wandering, vagrancy'. Israeli שלטוט shiltút was introduced by the Academy of the Hebrew Language in [...] 1996. Synchronically, it might appear to result from reduplication of the final consonant of shalát 'remote control'. Another example of blending which has also been explained as mere reduplication is Israeli גחלילית gakhlilít 'fire-fly, glow-fly, Lampyris'. This coinage by Hayyim Nahman Bialik blends (Hebrew>) Israeli גחלת gakhélet 'burning coal' with (Hebrew>) Israeli לילה láyla 'night'. Compare this with the unblended חכלילית khakhlilít '(black) redstart, Phœnicurus' (<Biblical Hebrew חכליל 'dull red, reddish'). Synchronically speaking though, most native Israeli-speakers feel that gakhlilít includes a reduplication of the third radical of גחל √għl. This is incidentally how Ernest Klein[21] explains gakhlilít. Since he is attempting to provide etymology, his description might be misleading if one agrees that Hayyim Nahman Bialik had blending in mind."[22] "There are two possible etymological analyses for Israeli Hebrew כספר kaspár 'bank clerk, teller'. The first is that it consists of (Hebrew>) Israeli כסף késef 'money' and the (International/Hebrew>) Israeli agentive suffix ר- -ár. The second is that it is a quasi-portmanteau word which blends כסף késef 'money' and (Hebrew>) Israeli ספר √spr 'count'. Israeli Hebrew כספר kaspár started as a brand name but soon entered the common language. Even if the second analysis is the correct one, the final syllable ר- -ár apparently facilitated nativization since it was regarded as the Hebrew suffix ר- -år (probably of Persian pedigree), which usually refers to craftsmen and professionals, for contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 44 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Blend_word responseCode 3 200
