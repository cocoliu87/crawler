They are organized into five levels of vitality. Level 1 contains the ten most vital articles, and each further level expands on the selection of the previous level, as follows: Level 1 (10 articles) - Level 2 (100 articles) - Level 3 (1,000 articles) - Level 4 (10,000 articles) - Level 5 (50,000 articles) This page serves as an index for the level 4 list. Because of its size, the list's articles have been categorized by topic into eleven sublists – please see the table below. Any modification to any of the sublists should only be made after discussion on this talk page. Please make sure items added to the level 4 list are also added to the Level 5 list once and only once. The vital article lists are meant to guide the prioritization of improvements to vital articles and to monitor their quality. They are tailored to the English Wikipedia, unlike the list of articles every Wikipedia should have on Meta-Wiki. They are actively maintained by the dedicated WikiProject Vital Articles. For more on the history, process and purpose behind the vital article lists, please visit the FAQ page.
