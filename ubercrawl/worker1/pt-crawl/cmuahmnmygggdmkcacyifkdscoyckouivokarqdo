A member of the Democratic Party and regarded as a progressive,[2] Warren has focused on consumer protection, equitable economic opportunity, and the social safety net while in the Senate. Warren was a candidate in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, ultimately finishing third. Born and raised in Oklahoma, Warren is a graduate of the University of Houston and Rutgers Law School and has taught law at several universities, including the University of Houston, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Pennsylvania, and Harvard University. She was one of the most influential professors in commercial and bankruptcy law before beginning her political career. Warren has written 12 books and more than 100 articles.[3][4][5] Warren's first foray into public policy began in 1995, when she worked to oppose what eventually became a 2005 act restricting bankruptcy access for individuals.[6][7] During the late 2000s, her national profile grew after her forceful public stances in favor of more stringent banking regulations after the financial crisis of 2007–2008. She served as chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and proposed and established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, for which she served as the first special advisor under President Barack Obama.[8] In 2012, Warren defeated incumbent Republican Scott Brown and became the first female U.S. senator from Massachusetts.[9] She won re-election by a wide margin in 2018, defeating Republican nominee Geoff Diehl.[10] On February 9, 2019, Warren announced her candidacy in the 2020 United States presidential election.[11] She was briefly considered the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in late 2019, but support for her campaign dwindled. She withdrew from the race on March 5, 2020, after Super Tuesday.[12] Early life and education Warren's high school graduation photo Warren was born Elizabeth Ann Herring in Oklahoma City on June 22, 1949.[13][14][15][16] She is the fourth child of Pauline Louise (née Reed, 1912–1995), a homemaker,[17] and Donald Jones Herring (1911–1997), a U.S. Army flight instructor during World War II, both of whom were members of the evangelical branch of the Protestant Methodist Church.[18] Warren has described her early family life as teetering "on the ragged edge of the middle class" and "kind of hanging on at the edges by our fingernails."[19][20] She and her three older brothers were raised Methodist.[21][22] Warren lived in Norman, Oklahoma, until she was 11 years old, when her family moved back to Oklahoma City.[20] When she was 12, her father, then a salesman at Montgomery Ward,[20] had a heart attack, which led to many medical bills as well as a pay cut because he could not do his previous work.[15] After leaving his sales job, he worked as a maintenance man for an apartment building.[23] Eventually, the family's car was repossessed because they failed to make loan payments. To help the family finances, her mother found work in the catalog-order department at Sears.[15] When she was 13, Warren started waiting tables at her aunt's restaurant.[24][25] Warren became a star member of the debate team at Northwest Classen High School and won the state high school debating championship. She also won a debate scholarship to George Washington University (GWU) at the age of 16.[15] She initially aspired to be a teacher, but left GWU after two years in 1968 to marry James Robert "Jim" Warren,[26] whom she had met in high school.[15][24][27] Warren and her husband moved to Houston, where he was employed by IBM.[15][28] She enrolled in the University of Houston and graduated in 1970 with a Bachelor of Science degree in speech pathology and audiology.[23][29] The Warrens moved to New Jersey when Jim received a job transfer. She soon became pregnant and decided to stay at home to care for their daughter, Amelia.[15][19][30] After Amelia turned two, Warren enrolled at Rutgers Law School.[30] She received her Juris Doctor in 1976 and passed the bar examination shortly thereafter.[27][30] Shortly before graduating, Warren became pregnant with their second child, Alexander.[15][19] Career In 1970, after obtaining a degree in speech pathology and audiology, but before enrolling in law school, Warren taught children with disabilities for a year in a public school.[31] During law school, she worked as a summer associate at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. After receiving her Juris Doctor and passing the bar examination, Warren offered legal services from home, writing wills and doing real estate closings.[27][30] In the late 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, Warren taught law at several American universities while researching issues related to bankruptcy and middle-class personal finance.[30] She became involved with public work in bankruptcy regulation and consumer protection in the mid-19 contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 50 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren responseCode 3 200
