In the beginning, only countries within the Commonwealth could join.[2] India, New Zealand and the West Indies joined in 1926, and Pakistan joined in 1953 after the partition of India.[3] In 1961, South Africa resigned from the Conference due to their leaving the Commonwealth,[2] but they continued to play Test cricket until their international exile in 1970.[4] The Imperial Cricket Conference was renamed the International Cricket Conference in 1965, with new rules permitting countries from outside the Commonwealth to be elected into the governing body for the first time: Fiji and the USA became the first associate member nations that year.[2] In 1981, Sri Lanka became the first associate member to be elected a full member, returning the number of Test-playing nations to seven. In 1989, the ICC was again renamed, this time to the International Cricket Council.[2] South Africa was re-elected as a full member of the ICC in 1991, with Zimbabwe elected in 1992,[3] and Bangladesh elected in 2000.[3] On 22 June 2017, Ireland and Afghanistan were granted full member (and Test) status, bringing the number of full members to 12.[5] As of November 2023, there are 108 ICC members, with 12 full members and 96 associate members. [6] The membership committee will consider all future requests for membership – full and associate – against an objective set of criteria. There was previously a third level, affiliate membership, which was abolished in June 2017, with all existing affiliate members becoming associate members,[7] and introducing a two-tier hierarchy (full members and associate members): any new member elected to the ICC would be an associate member, with the possibility of promotion to full member status based on ongoing performance in international competition. From July to October 2019, the ICC suspended Zimbabwe Cricket due to government interference, the first time this had occurred with a full member side.[8][9][10] On 10 November 2023, the ICC suspended Sri Lanka Cricket due to government interference in the board. [11] Full members[edit] Full members are the governing bodies for cricket in a country or a group of associated countries representing a geographical area. All full members have a right to send a representative team to play official Test matches, have full voting rights at meetings of the ICC, and are automatically qualified to play ODIs and T20Is.[2] The West Indies cricket team is a combined team representing 15 countries and territories from the Caribbean, while the English cricket team represents both England and Wales and the Irish cricket team represents all of the island of Ireland. Of these 12 nations, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Ireland played as associate members before being elected as full members. In April 2021, ICC granted permanent Women's Test status to all the full member nations.[12] No Country Teams Governing body Full member since[2] Test status since Region 1 Afghanistan Men • Women • U19 Afghanistan Cricket Board 22 June 2017 14 June 2018 Asia 2 Australia Men • Women • U19 Cricket Australia 15 June 1909 15 March 1877 East Asia-Pacific 3 Bangladesh Men • Women • U19 Bangladesh Cricket Board 26 June 2000 10 November 2000 Asia 4 England Men • Women • U19 England and Wales Cricket Board 15 June 1909 15 March 1877 Europe 5 India Men • Women • U19 Board of Control for Cricket in India 31 May 1926 25 June 1932 Asia 6 Ireland Men • Women • U19 Cricket Ireland 22 June 2017 11 May 2018 Europe 7 New Zealand Men • Women • U19 New Zealand Cricket 31 May 1926 10 January 1930 East Asia-Pacific 8 Pakistan Men • Women • U19 Pakistan Cricket Board 28 July 1952 16 October 1952 Asia 9 South Africa Men • Women • U19 Cricket South Africa 15 June 1909 12 March 1889 Africa 10 West Indies Men • Women • U19 Cricket West Indies 31 May 1926 23 June 1928 Americas 11 Zimbabwe Men • Women • U19 Zimbabwe Cricket 6 July 1992 18 October 1992 Africa Reference: ICC Men's Rankings, ICC Women's Rankings, 23 October 2021 Associate members[edit] Associate members are countries where cricket is firmly established and organised, but do not qualify for full membership.[2] There are 96 associate members.[13] All associates were eligible to play in the World Cricket League, a series of international one-day cricket administered by the ICC until 2019.[14] This was replaced by the ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 and ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League from 2019 onwards.[15] There are also ICC Men's T20 World Cup Qualifier events that works as a qualification process for ICC Men's T20 World Cup: until April 2018, only the qualified teams were awarded Twenty20 International status.[16] In April 2018, the ICC announced T20I status for all its members from 1 July 2018 for the women's game, and from 1 January 2019 for the men's game.[17] †Denotes members that are currently suspended by the ICC.
