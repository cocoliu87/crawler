Website complexnetworks.com Complex Networks is an American media and entertainment company for youth culture, based in New York City.[10] It was founded as a bi-monthly magazine, Complex, by fashion designer Marc (Ecko) Milecofsky.[11][12][13] Complex Networks reports on popular and emerging trends in style, sneakers, food, music, sports and pop culture.[14] Complex Networks reached over 90 million unique users per month in 2013[15] across its owned and operated and partner sites, socials and YouTube channels.[16][17] The print magazine ceased publication with the December 2016/January 2017 issue.[18] Complex currently has 6.02 million subscribers and 1.8 billion total views on YouTube.[19] As of 2019,[update] the company's yearly revenue was estimated to be US$200 million, 15% of which came from commerce.[20] Complex Networks has been named by Business Insider as one of the Most Valuable Startups in New York,[21] and Most Valuable Private Companies in the World.[22] Complex Networks CEO Rich Antoniello was named among the Silicon Alley 100.[23] In 2012, the company launched Complex TV, an online broadcasting platform. In 2016, it became a joint-venture subsidiary of Verizon and Hearst.[24] Subsequently in 2021, BuzzFeed, Inc. announced the acquisition of the company.[25] History[edit] Complex was established in 2002[26] by the founder of the Eckō Unltd. brand, Marc Ecko, as a print magazine aimed at providing young men a report of the latest in hip hop, fashion and pop culture without regard to race.[13] The name Complex evolved from a slogan developed to promote the Eckō Unltd. website: "Ecko.complex".[27] The idea was to create a men's magazine that combined Eckō's streetwear and hip hop attitude along with the style of Japanese men's magazines by providing consumer guides. This was achieved by creating a magazine in two sections: one traditional magazine, and the other a shopping guide. In 2005, Complex was joined by senior publishing executive turned future CEO, Rich Antoniello[1] and the former senior editor of Vibe magazine, Noah Callahan-Bever, who became editor-in-chief and chief content officer a year later.[28] By 2006, Complex had begun to turn a profit which allowed the magazine to consider an expansion of their online presence. In April 2007, Complex soft-launched a media network with four websites: NahRight, Nice Kicks, SlamxHype and MoeJackson.[1] Complex[edit] In September 2007, Complex launched Complex Media in order to fully capitalize on the trend toward digital content.[29] In 2010, ad sales grew 154%.[30] According to comScore, Complex got 12 million unique hits in March 2012. This encouraged large brands such as Coors, AT&T, Ford, McDonald's, Nike, Adidas and Apple to advertise within the collective. Complex now includes over 100 sites.[13] In 2011, Complex acquired Pigeons & Planes, an indie music and rap blog, and brought their total sites to 51 with monthly traffic of 25 million uniques.[31] In 2012, Complex launched Four Pins, a humorous menswear site, edited by Fuck Yeah Menswear author Lawrence Schlossman;[32] Sneaker Report, a performance footwear site;[33] and First We Feast, a food culture site edited by former Time Out New York food editor Chris Schonberger.[34] In 2013, Complex launched the dance music site Do Androids Dance[35] and Green Label, a branded content site presented by Mountain Dew.[36] That year, Complex also acquired the sneakerhead culture magazine and website Sole Collector.[37] On November 4, 2013, Complex premiered a new logo and cover design on Instagram that would appear online, as well as on the December 2013 Eminem cover issue.[38][39] In 2013, Complex partnered with Mountain Dew to launch "Green Label" an entertainment and culture website.[40] In 2014, Complex launched an NBA-themed website called "Triangle Offense" in a partnership with Bacardi rum.[41] In August 2014, Complex ranked #3 in the United States in a ComScore survey of unique visitors between the ages of 18 and 34 with 20.3 million in that demographic per month.[42] In January 2015, it announced its acquisition of Collider, the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends. Collider.com reaches over 3 million monthly unique readers (comScore, December 2014) powered by a team of ten writers, including founder and Editor in Chief Steve Weintraub. In February 2018, Complex sold Collider.com to former head-of-video Marc Fernandez.[43][44] In 2015, Do Androids Dance was merged into Complex.[45] In 2016, Four Pins was closed.[46] Funding[edit] In 2009, Complex raised $12.8 million from Accel Partners and Austin Ventures.[47] In September 2013, it secured $25 million in a second round of funding from Iconix Brand Group, who own Rocawear, Starter, Eckō Unltd. and Umbro, among others.[48] Verizon Hearst Media Partners subsidiary[edit] On April 18, 2016, Complex was acquired by a joint venture of Hearst Communications and Verizon Communications, Verizon Hearst Media Partners. The venture emphasized a goal of building "a portfolio of the emerging digital brands of the future for the millennial and Gen-Z audience", and proposed that Complex would develop content for Verizon-owned AOL and go90.[49] After a failure to reach expectations, on June 29, 2018, Verizon announced that go90 would shut down.[50] Covers[edit] Complex became known early on for its double-sided covers and split format.[51] Complex covers often combined celebrities from across music, film and sports. For example, Mos Def and David Bowie appeared together on the cover of the August/September 2003 issue. Some of Complex's early covers included Nas (May 2002), Tony Hawk and Xzibit (June/July 2002), Ludacris and Dale Earnhardt Jr. (April/May 2003), and Mos Def and David Bowie (August/September 2003). In 2007, Complex gave Kim Kardashian her first-ever magazine shoot and cover.[52] Complex has since expanded to interactive digital covers.[53] In September 2019, the American rapper Kid Cudi and the Japanese designer Nigo were interviewed by Complex and also appeared jointly on a digital cover and told the stories of their careers and rise in the entertainment and streetwear industries.[54][55] Complex shows[edit] Complex TV launched in 2012 as an online broadcaster of original content. Nathan Brown, a long-time video development and production executive, serves as general manager of Complex TV and Video.[56] In December 2013, a subsidiary of Complex TV, Complex News, was launched, focusing on day-to-day news.[15][57][58] In 2014, Pluto.tv added Complex Media as a content partner.[16] Complex Content Studio is supported by an 18-person editorial team.[59] According to WNIP source, "by 2016, Complex Networks had shifted 80% of its content budget to video and was launching dozens of individual shows under Complex's YouTube channel and a number of spin-off properties".[60] On November 10, 2017, a block of Complex TV series began airing on the U.S. cable network Fuse under the Complex x Fuse banner.[61][62] Complex Networks has produced more than two dozen original shows,[63][64] which include Hot Ones and Desus vs. Mero.
