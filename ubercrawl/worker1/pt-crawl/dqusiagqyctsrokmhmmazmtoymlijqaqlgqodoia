He has played for Bengal in domestic cricket and for four teams in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Shami bowls the ball off the seam and uses swing, including reverse swing, to move the ball both ways. He has been reputed to have an edge in the "death (closing) overs" of a limited-overs innings and, in all formats, has been described as being at times "unplayable". He is widely considered among the best bowlers of his generation and one of the greatest fast bowlers India has produced. Shami is India’s leading wicket taker at ICC Men’s Cricket World Cups with 55 wickets in 18 matches and is the current Indian record holder for best bowling spell in an ODI, as he claimed 7 wickets for 57 runs against New Zealand in November 2023.[2][3] Shami is also the fastest bowler to take 50 wickets in the 48 year history of Cricket World Cup spanning 13 editions. Early life and career[edit] Shami grew up in the village of Sahaspur in Amroha, Uttar Pradesh, one of five children.[4][5] His father, Tauseef Ali[b] was a farmer who had been a fast bowler in his youth.[5][6] when Shami was 15 he was taken to Badruddin Siddique, a cricket coach in Moradabad, a town 22 kilometres (14 mi) from his home.[4][6] "When I first saw him [Shami] bowling at the nets as a 15-year-old kid, I knew this boy is not ordinary. So I decided to train him. For one year I prepared him for the UP trials, as we don't have club cricket over here. He was very co-operative, very regular and very hard working. He never took a day off from training. During the under 19 trials he bowled really well, but due to politics, he missed out on selection. They asked me to bring him next year, but at that moment I didn't want Shami to miss one year. So I advised his parents to send him to Kolkata."[6] — Badruddin Siddique on Mohammed Shami Shami worked hard on his technique throughout his time at Moradabad; after matches, he would request the used balls so that he could develop the ability to reverse swing the older ball, a skill that would be integral to his success later in his career.[7][8][9] He was not, however, selected for the Uttar Pradesh under-19 side, and later in 2005 Badruddin sent him to Kolkata to increase his chances of selection for a state side.[4] After playing for the Dalhousie Athletic Club,[10] he was recommended to Debabrata Das, a former assistant secretary of the Cricket Association of Bengal, who was impressed with Shami's bowling and asked him to join his own club, Town Club.[11] Das took Shami, who had no place to stay in Kolkata, to live with him.[9] After bowling well for Town Club, Das asked one of the Bengal selectors, Sambaran Banerjee, to watch Shami bowl; Banerjee was impressed and selected him for the Bengal under-22 team.[4][6] "Shami never wanted money. His goal was the stumps, the sound that comes from hitting the stumps. Ever since I saw him, most of his wickets were bowled. He bowls with an upright seam, on or just outside off stump, and gets it to cut back in."[9] — Debabrata Das on Mohammed Shami Shami later joined Mohun Bagan Cricket Club, one of the best sides in Bengal, in order to be considered for selection to the full state side. He bowled to former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly in the Eden Gardens nets; Ganguly recommended him to the state selectors and, soon afterwards, Shami was included in the Bengal squad for the 2010–11 Ranji Trophy.[6][9] Domestic career[edit] Eden Gardens, Bengal's home ground and where Shami made both his first-class and Test match debuts Shami took four wickets on his senior debut for Bengal in a Twenty20 match in October 2010.[12] The following month, he made his first-class cricket debut against Assam at Eden Gardens, taking three wickets in a high scoring match.[13][14] In February 2012 his bowling helped East Zone win their first Duleep Trophy title; he took eight wickets in the match and was described as "outstanding, consistently getting bounce and zip from just short of a good length".[15] He had only played in the match following an injury to Abu Nechim, but it proved to be a significant breakthrough in Shami's career;[16] he had been described as "little-known" before the match,[17] but by April was being touted as a player to watch in the upcoming Indian Premier League season.[16] He was selected to tour the West Indies with the India A side and "impressed" with his bowling on pitches which were considered to be generally unhelpful to fast bowlers.[18] Shami was considered to have been the "surprise package" of the tour for India A, and impressed the team's coach Lalchand Rajput with his strength and consistency whilst bowling, as well as with his batting;[19] batting tenth in the first unofficial Test match, he scored 27 runs in a partnership of 73 with Cheteshwar Pujara which won the match for India A.[20] Later in the year he was one of only two fast bowlers retained for the India A tour of New Zealand,[21] although he only played in two of the six matches on the tour.[22] During the 2012–13 Ranji Trophy, Shami took 11 wickets in a match against Madhya Pradesh in November, including seven wickets for 79 runs (7/79) in the first innings, a return which included a hat-trick.[23][24] The following month he took 4/36 and 6/71 against Hyderabad on a green wicket at Eden Gardens, his second ten-wicket match in only his 15th first-class game.[c][26][27] In the five Ranji Trophy matches he played during the season he took 28 wickets at a bowling average of 21.25 runs per wicket,[25] and in the 18 first-class matches he played before his Test match debut in 2013 he took 71 wickets, an average of four wickets each match.[8] Since making his international debut in 2013, Shami has played only occasionally for his state side. He played a limited overs match in March 2017 after not having played any competitive cricket for a period of four months,[28] and took part in four Ranji Trophy matches later in 2017, his first for around five years,[29] to develop and maintain his fitness.[30] A single first-class match for Bengal followed in 2018[22]—with the BCCI requesting that he be limited to bowling no more than 15 overs in each innings in the match to ensure his fitness for an upcoming Test series.[31][32] Shami has not played for Bengal since 2018/19 season.[33] International cricket[edit] Test career[edit] 2013 to 2018[edit] Shami made his Test debut against West Indies in November 2013 in front of his home crowd at Eden Gardens, Kolkata. In the first innings, he took his maiden Test wicket – that of Kieran Powell – and finished with figures of 4/71.[34] In the second innings, he took 5/47.[34] His match total of nine wickets, for 118 runs, is the most by an Indian pacer on debut, surpassing Munaf Patel's seven wickets for 97 runs at Mohali in 2006.[35] Shami warming up before a match for India in 2018 Shami was selected for India's tour of South Africa and New Zealand, taking 16 Test wickets in total.[36] He had little success on India's 2014 tour of England, however, finishing with just five wickets in three matches.[37][38][39] He was involved in a 111-run partnership for the 10th wicket, with Bhuvneshwar Kumar in the first Test at Trent Bridge, scoring his maiden half-century in the process and helping India post 457 in the first innings.[40] Shami practising in Sydney Cricket Ground before a Test match against Australia in January 2015 He took 15 wickets in three Tests during India's 2014–15 tour of Australia,[41] and went on to become the 20th Indian fast bowler to take 100 Test wickets, reaching the milestone in 29 Tests.[42] In 2018, he toured England with India, playing in all five Tests. He finished the series with 16 wickets,[43] including six in the fourth Test.[44] 2019–21 ICC World Test Championship[edit] During the 2019–21 ICC World Test Championship, in the 2019 India-West Indies two-match Test series, Shami took nine wickets.[45][46] He took thirteen in the home series against South Africa (2019)[47][48][49] and five in New Zealand (2020).[50][51] He was included in the playing XI of the first international pink ball Test match organised in India, at Eden Gardens, the second Test of the 2019–20 Bangladesh tour of India, in which he took two wickets.[52] During this series, Shami reached seventh position in the ICC Men's Player Rankings after taking seven wickets in the first Test.[53] His rating of 790 points was then the third-best achieved by an India  contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 48 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Mohammed_Shami responseCode 3 200
