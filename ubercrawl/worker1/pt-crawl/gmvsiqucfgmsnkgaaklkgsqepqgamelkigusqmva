July 31 300 Game Winner and future Hall Of Famer Greg Maddux was traded by the Chicago Cubs to the Los Angeles Dodgers for shortstop Cesar Izturis. Thumbs-down The Tom 20:52, 31 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Second thumbs-down. Lack importance or significance, maybe except in the NL West where every team sucks. --PFHLai 22:17, 31 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Fidel Castro transfers power to brother Raul Castro following serious health problems. Abel 01:41, 1 August 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Thumbs up. I am still usure of this page's procedures, but this seems pretty significant at this moment. Here is an [article]. Thumbs down. It's normal for a leader to transfer power if he has surgery. Unless the transfer turns permanent (ie. Castro dies), I don't think it's worthy. Preston 03:01, 1 August 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Well, this is Cuba - a world-famous player. Also, the implications of an illness of a world leader at 80 are very serious. This is especially true in Cuba, where many believe the whole regime depends on the power of a single person - a seriously ill one. No matter what happens next, there are great chances that this moment will be considered the beginning of the end of Fidel. --Cryout 03:30, 1 August 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] I agree with Cryout. (Er, Thumb's up.) Johndodd 06:10, 1 August 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] I agree completely too. There is a chance that this moment will be considered the beginning of the end of Fidel. And as soon as something happens to signify that this moment will be such, I'll support it's inclusion. If he dies, is his surgery goes wrong, if his brother indicates that he doesn't intend to give power back, etc. There's a chance this could be very big in the near future. Key words, chance, could, and future. Preston 07:39, 1 August 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] I agree with Preston.--Peta 03:04, 1 August 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] July 30 Change "carrier, Graf Zeppelin" to "carrier. It was named after the Graf Zeppelin," because the airship Graf Zeppelin is famous; the carrier is not. In fact, the word zeppelin in English means big airship, because there used to be so many of them. 155 zeppelins were built in Germany between 1900 and 1919. Graf Zeppelin flew from one airport to another around the world for the first time in 1929.--Chuck Marean 16:52, 30 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Actually, both the aircraft carrier and the airships were named after pioneer aviator Ferdinand von Zeppelin. The ITN blurb has been revised to mention the German Navy at the time. It should be obvious now that it's not about an airship. --PFHLai 00:20, 31 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] The Israeli-Lebanese conflict should go back to the top of the news section after Qana bombings. I suggest something like that :" Israeli forces attack Qana, as part of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict killing 57 civilians."--Wedian 13:30, 30 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] This is, since last night (I think), the second item from the top, instead of the bottom-most item. The blurb now mentions Qana. Hope this is good enough. -- PFHLai 22:20, 31 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] July 28 Something on the heatwaves would be good (90 dead in California, 60+ in France), it probably doesn't need an article of its own though.--Peta 05:30, 28 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Please see 2006 European heat wave & 2006 United States heat wave. --PFHLai 05:40, 28 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] How about - Heat waves in Europe and the United States kill more than 150 people. --Peta I suggest including a time frame in the blurb. -- PFHLai 05:54, 28 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] I am uncomfortable with "kill more than 150 people" without qualifying when and where. Also, I can't find the "150" number in either articles.Posted a shorter version, anyway. -- PFHLai 15:54, 29 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] July 26 An ancient Irish manuscript described by Pat Wallace, the director of the National Museum of Ireland, as being of "staggering significance' has been found in a bog in the Irish midlands by a farmer. Dr. Bernard Meehan of Trinity College Dublin was astounded at the discovery, "I only heard about this yesterday, and since then I've been trying to come to terms with it. I cannot think of a parallel anywhere . . . What we have here is a really spectacular, completely unexpected find.' It is estimated that it could be between 1,000 and 1,200-years-old and unashamedly ecstatic staff at the museum said yesterday its discovery was an Irish equivalent to that of the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls. El Gringo 11:02, 26 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Fascinating but is there an updated article? --Golbez 15:12, 26 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] It is here. It is quite short at the moment, but maybe putting it on the front page would help it? Maybe wording like "A 1200 year old manuscript provisionally called the Irish Psalter is found in an Irish bog"? Batmanand | Talk 21:54, 26 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Posted. (Have been waiting for the article to grow.) -- PFHLai 14:50, 27 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] July 25 Creditors decide to bankrupt Russian oil producing company Yukos after rejecting a financial restructuring plan. Errabee 10:58, 25 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Not sure this qualifies for ITN. Seems like local business news to me. The fight between the management and the Russian government was big news, but not anymore. -- PFHLai 14:54, 27 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] July 24 The Doha round of the WTO global trade talks suffered a major setback, when negotiators of the U.S. and the European Union failed to reach an agreement on reducing farming subsidies and lowering import taxes. Errabee 12:30, 24 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] I think this is a major issue; can I suggest wording such as "The Doha round of the WTO global trade talks are suspended in Geneva, amid substantial disagreements over farming subsidies and import taxes between the USA, the EU and the developing world". Batmanand | Talk 21:58, 24 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Fine by me. Errabee 22:57, 24 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Posted a while ago (not by me). -- PFHLai 14:51, 27 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] July 23 Tiger Woods wins the 2006 British Open, his second consecutive Open Championship and eleventh major. --Howard the Duck 02:01, 24 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] He is crying, too.--Patchouli 03:14, 24 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Posted a few days ago, but we didn't mention his tears. -- PFHLai 14:57, 27 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] There is an administrator who is posting vanity for the In the news section just to irk Wikipedians.--Patchouli 03:11, 24 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] C'mon. Rogue admins posting weird stuffs on ITN is hardly news at all ! :-p --PFHLai 14:57, 27 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] July 21 Ta Mok, Khmer Rouge Butcher dies at age 80 before his trial can be started. --Ionius Mundus 08:19, 22 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Posted a few days ago. -- PFHLai 05:48, 28 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Sheik Hassan Aweys, in a radio broadcast, urges holy war on Ethiopian troops stationed in Baidoa to support the UN-backed government of Somalia.[1]--Patchouli 21:41, 21 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Updated article? -Fsotrain09 21:43, 21 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] In the Philippine Basketball Association, the Purefoods Chunkee Giants defeated the Red Bull Barako for their seventh championship. --Howard the Duck 02:47, 22 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Heh heh. This has great potential to open a huge debate as to what sporting events get put up. --Golbez 05:10, 22 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Lol, I'm just hoping against hope, of course this is a professional league a la NBA (which is also a national-based league), but whatever. --Howard the Duck 05:40, 22 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] I opine that no sport from any country should be included.--Patchouli 08:30, 22 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Even The Open Championships? --Howard the Duck 09:26, 22 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Does that mean the NBA (which is multinational) or NFL Europe (which is pan-European) are allowed, but Wimbledon and the Kentucky Derby are not? --Golbez 14:29, 22 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] OMG! The Super Bowl won't be there too?! They're all American teams, right? --Howard the Duck 14:41, 22 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] I dunno, Texas is a whole 'nother country. --Golbez 14:52, 22 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] LOL. But is my news piece ever gonna be posted at the main page? Can an admin answer this? --Howard the Duck 15:01, 22 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] I'm an admin but I want to see how others handle this. :) --Golbez 15:05, 22 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] We've been bombarded by European and American-centric sports news already (was the African Nations Cup ever added at the ITN?). Perhaps an Asian sports news should be added. Even the Japan Series should be added or the AFC Champions League (when it is concluded). --Howard the Duck 15:14, 22 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Here's an idea. The recent Main Page redesign has given us more room for ITN, shown by the larger number of stories it's handling. Why not split out two sections - Recent notable deaths, and recent sporting championships? Not news, just championships. Right now, ITN has five rather long stories, and it could easily support 7 or 8 shorter ones. How about we confine ITN to 4 or 5 shorter stories, grant one of these to the most recent major sporting championship, and one of these to the most recent major death? Or just ignore the death thing for now. --Golbez 17:21, 22 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] My opinion: No sports please. Neither ballet nor bodybuilding.--Patchouli 16:45, 23 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Well, the 2006 Tour de France was there. Maybe some admin can expand it a little bit. --Howard the Duck 16:47, 23 July 20 contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 76 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Wikipedia:In_the_news/Candidates/July_2006 responseCode 3 200
