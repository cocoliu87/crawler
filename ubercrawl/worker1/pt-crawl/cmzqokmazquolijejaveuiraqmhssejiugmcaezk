This project will use only FL, List, and Stub for articles. Quality Classes such as Image, Template, Portal, Disambiguation, Category and Project will only be included in order to conform with the predefined Wikipedia:Namespace. Currently, this project uses the Version 1.0 Editorial Team bot for article statistics. Therefore, it has become necessary for the project create a Custom mask for Quality class. The Custom mask for WikiProject Lists limits class to FL, List, and Stub for articles, and automatically changes incorrect class codes.
