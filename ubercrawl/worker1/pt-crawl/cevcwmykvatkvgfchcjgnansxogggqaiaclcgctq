He moved to Gaul (modern France), taking all of the mobile troops and their commander Gerontius from Britain to confront bands of Germanic invaders. Constantine stabilised the situation and established control over Gaul and Hispania (modern Spain and Portugal). Honorius, the Western Roman emperor, sent an army to expel Constantine's forces. After initial victories it was repulsed. In early 409 Honorius recognised Constantine as co-emperor. Constantine in turn raised his oldest son to co-emperor as Constans II. In 409 Gerontius rebelled, defeating and killing Constans in early 411. Meanwhile, Honorius appointed a new general, Constantius, who besieged Constantine in Arles. A relief force was ambushed and he abdicated, took holy orders and – promised his life – surrendered. Constantius had lied: Constantine was killed and his head presented to Honorius on a pole in September 411. (Full article...)

Widows was inspired by his Scottish ancestry and is regarded as one of his most autobiographical collections. It is named for the widows of the Battle of Culloden (1746) and makes extensive use of elements taken from Highland dress, including the McQueen family tartan (pictured) and traditional gamekeeper's tweeds. The collection's runway show was staged on 3 March 2006 during Paris Fashion Week, and marked a return to theatricality for McQueen. Widows was presented on a square stage with a glass pyramid at its centre. Fifty-one ensembles were presented across roughly three phases, ending with a Pepper's ghost illusion of the English model Kate Moss projected within the glass pyramid. Critical response was positive, especially towards McQueen's tailoring and the collection's balance of artistry and commercial practicality. (Full article...)

Kennedy on November 22, 1963, captured a fraction of a second after a bullet struck Kennedy's head. Such a person is not present in any other photographs of the assassination and was not seen by any witnesses. Much of the detail is obscured, some believe by a muzzle flash. The moniker derives from a bright spot on what is deemed the figure's chest, said to resemble a gleaming badge. The photograph was analyzed by the House Select Committee on Assassinations, but no evidence of hidden figures was found. However, in 1983, Gary Mack—the curator of the Sixth Floor Museum—obtained a higher quality copy of the photograph. Upon enhancement, Mack noted what he believed to be the Badge Man in the shadowed background. Conspiracy theorists have suggested that this figure is a sniper or a man in police uniform, and believe it to be a second assassin, firing at Kennedy from the grassy knoll. (Full article...)

Involving himself politically under the reign of his father Henry III, Edward briefly sided with a baronial reform movement. After reconciliation with Henry III, Edward defeated the barons by 1267 and set out to the Holy Land on a crusade in 1270. On his return journey, Edward learned of his father's death; the new king returned to England in 1274 and was crowned in Westminster Abbey. Edward spent his reign reforming English currency and pushing through major legislative reform, in addition to involving himself in conflict with France. Edward conquered Wales and intended to likewise take over Scotland; this ultimately failed. Upon his death, he was succeeded by his son Edward II. Edward has been considered one of the greatest medieval English kings for the achievements of his reign, but some historians have criticised him for his brutal military campaigns and for expelling English Jews.
