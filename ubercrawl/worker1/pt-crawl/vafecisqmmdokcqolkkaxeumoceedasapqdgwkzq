On 3 March, the city suffered a bombing that killed 47 people.[5] Russian major general Andrei Sukhovetsky, then deputy commander of the 41st Combined Arms Army, was killed on 4 March, the day after the bombing, becoming the first Russian general to die during the Russian invasion.[6] On 10 March, the city entered a siege[7] which lasted until 31 March when the Ukrainian forces managed to undo the encirclement of the city.[8] As fighting continued, more civilians died in Chernihiv. On 16 March, the Governor of Chernihiv Oblast Vyacheslav Chaus reported that the Russian attacks on Chernihiv on that day alone had killed a total of 53 people.[9] Attack[edit] The event was reported by Chaus as well as the United States Embassy in Kyiv. On Ukrainian television, Chaus said the attack, which he described as a bombing, was "not the first such incoming shell, nor is it the first shelling of civilians by the enemy".[10] The US Embassy reported that the people had been "shot and killed".[11] 18 people were reported dead by local authorities.[1] The incident happened at around 10:00 UTC+3. Victims of the incident were killed following a blast shot from heavy artillery.[12] These civilians were unarmed and some of them survived the shelling; they were taken to medical facilities by Chernihiv police.[13] External videos Video of the aftermath James Whitney Hill, a 67-year-old US citizen from Minnesota was killed in the attack.[14] Chernihiv Patrol Police and the US State Department confirmed the death of a US citizen.[15] James, known on social media as "Jimmy Hill", was an English-language teacher and refused to leave Ukraine when the war started to provide care for his partner Iryna, a Ukrainian citizen.[16] Reactions[edit] Around four hours after the incident, the Chernihiv Regional Prosecutor's Office filed a legal case regarding the attack. The Chernihiv Oblast branch of the Security Service of Ukraine also started an investigation.[12] See also[edit] 3 March 2022 Chernihiv bombing August 2023 Chernihiv missile strike War crimes in the Russian invasion of Ukraine References[edit] ^ a b c d "Ukraine: Russian Strikes Killed Scores of Civilians in Chernihiv".
