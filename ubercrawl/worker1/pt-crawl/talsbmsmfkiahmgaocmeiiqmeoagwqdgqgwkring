It was held from 9 to 25 June 1983 in England and Wales and was won by India. Eight countries participated in the event. England, India, Pakistan and West Indies qualified for the semi-finals. The preliminary matches were played in two groups of four teams each, and each country played the others in its group twice. The top two teams in each group qualified for the semi-finals. The matches consisted of 60 overs per innings and were played in traditional white clothing and with red balls. They were all played during the day. Format[edit] The eight teams at the tournament were divided into two groups of four, and each team would play the others in their group twice. The top two teams from each group then advanced to the semi-finals, which were played as a single-elimination tournament. Every games were of 60 overs a side, and there were no day/night matches.

Group A comprised the hosts England, Pakistan, New Zealand and Sri Lanka; while Group B contained reigning champions West Indies, India, Australia, and the sole qualifier Zimbabwe. Unlike in later World Cups, with formats designed such that all games could be screened live on television, matches took place simultaneously at multiple venues, with matches played every other day and a reserve day in case of rain, although only three of the matches required a second day.[1] In Group A, England started strongly with a 106 run victory over New Zealand at The Oval, scoring an imposing 322/6 in their innings, driven by a partnership of 115 in 16 overs between Allan Lamb and Mike Gatting. Pakistan also started with a win, by 50 runs over Sri Lanka, despite being hampered throughout the tournament by Imran Khan being unfit to bowl, after scoring 338/5 in 60 overs.[2] England's second group match brought a second win, as David Gower's 130, including five sixes and 12 fours, powered a 47 run win over Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, New Zealand beat Pakistan by 52 runs despite Abdul Qadir's 4/21 in 12 overs. England then beat Pakistan by 8 wickets with nearly ten overs to spare at Lord's, while Richard Hadlee's 5/25 saw Sri Lanka bowled out for 206, New Zealand getting home with over 20 overs to spare. England's only defeat of the group stages came in the fourth round of matches, against New Zealand, off the penultimate ball of the New Zealand innings. Pakistan triumphed over Sri Lanka, once again led by Abdul Qadir (5/44). The fifth round of matches on 18 June saw England seal their place in the semi-final, with a first wicket partnership of 115 between Graeme Fowler and Chris Tavaré alone scoring nearly half of Pakistan's 232. Meanwhile, New Zealand failed to secure passage to the knockout stage, losing to Sri Lanka in a low scoring affair. In the final round of matches, England beat Sri Lanka by 9 wickets in a match with no implications for the final table. The match between New Zealand and Pakistan would decide the second qualifier. Any win by New Zealand would be sufficient to see them qualify; Pakistan had not only to win, but do so by a sufficient margin to overhaul New Zealand's average run rate.[3] An 11 run victory for Pakistan proved sufficient, as Zaheer Abbas made an unbeaten 103 before New Zealand were bowled out. Group B started with the first shock of the tournament, as Zimbabwe beat Australia in what Wisden described as "a bigger surprise than any in the previous two world cups".[4] Duncan Fletcher led the way, making 69* and being awarded man of the match. In the other opening Group B match, India delivered another "shocker" as they beat the holders West Indies by 34 runs, bowling them out for 228 with 35 balls to spare – the first defeat suffered by the West Indies in a World Cup as they had dominated both the 1975 and 1979 tournaments without losing a single match in either tournament. Wet weather in the second round of games played on 11 June led to low scores. West Indies scored 252/9 in their innings, which stretched over two days, against Australia; in response, Australia were bowled out for 151 in just 30.3 overs, an effort not helped by Graeme Wood being taken to hospital with severe concussion after being hit by Michael Holding.[5] India comfortably beat Zimbabwe by 5 wickets in the contemporaneous fixture. Two days later, Australia defeated India by 162 runs, with man of the match Trevor Chappell scoring 110 off 131 balls and Ken MacLeay taking 6/39. The other match that day was also a one-sided affair, as West Indies restricted Zimbabwe to just 217/7 in their 60 overs, despite Duncan Fletcher scoring another unbeaten half century, and then romped home with a partnership of 195 for the third wicket between Gordon Greenidge and Larry Gomes. In the first of the return fixtures, West Indies overcame India by 66 runs, with Viv Richards making 119; for the second time in the tournament, an opposing batsman retired hurt, as Dilip Vengsarkar was the unlucky batsman on this occasion, hit in the mouth by Malcolm Marshall.[6] Australia beat Zimbabwe by 32 runs to level their account in the tournament. The India v Zimbabwe match on 18 June was described by Wisden as "a remarkable match [which] contained one of the most spectacular innings played in this form of cricket", as Kapil Dev coming in to bat with India at 9/4 that soon became 17/5, went on to score 175 not out from India's score of 266/8, which Zimbabwe narrowly failed to chase down, India winning by 31 runs.[7] West Indies qualified for the semi-finals with a match to spare, beating Australia by 7 wickets substantially due to a partnership of 124 for the second wicket between Greenidge and Richards. That left West Indies versus Zimbabwe as a dead rubber, and West Indies duly won by ten wickets with nearly fifteen overs to spare. The final group B match was a straightforward tussle for qualification between Australia and India. However, after India had made 247 all out, in a team effort where the highest score was 40 and there were 37 extras, Australia collapsed to 129 all out, with Madan Lal and Roger Binny taking four wickets each.[8] Group A[edit] Main article: 1983 Cricket World Cup Group A Pos Team v t e Pld W L T NR Pts RR 1 England 6 5 1 0 0 20 4.671 2 Pakistan 6 3 3 0 0 12 4.014 3 New Zealand 6 3 3 0 0 12 3.927 4 Sri Lanka 6 1 5 0 0 4 3.752 Source: ESPNcricinfo 9 June 1983 Scorecard England 322/6 (60 overs) v New Zealand 216 (59 overs) England won by 106 runs The Oval, London 9 June 1983 Scorecard Pakistan 338/5 (60 overs) v Sri Lanka 288/9 (60 overs) Pakistan won by 50 runs St Helen's, Swansea 11 June 1983 Scorecard England 333/9 (60 overs) v Sri Lanka 286 (58 overs) England won by 47 runs County Ground, Taunton 11 June 1983 Scorecard New Zealand 238/9 (60 overs) v Pakistan 186 (55.2 overs) New Zealand won by 52 runs Edgbaston, Birmingham 13 June 1983 Scorecard Pakistan 193/8 (60 overs) v England 199/2 (50.4 overs) England won by 8 wickets Lord's, London 13 June 1983 Scorecard Sri Lanka 206 (56.1 overs) v New Zealand 209/5 (39.2 overs) New Zealand won by 5 wickets County Ground, Bristol 15 June 1983 Scorecard England 234 (55.2 overs) v New Zealand 238/8 (59.5 overs) New Zealand won by 2 wickets Edgbaston, Birmingham 16 June 1983 Scorecard Pakistan 235/7 (60 overs) v Sri Lanka 224 (58.3 overs) Pakistan won by 11 runs Headingley, Leeds 18 June 1983 Scorecard Pakistan 232/8 (60 overs) v England 233/3 (57.2 overs) England won by 7 wickets Old Trafford, Manchester 18 June 1983 Scorecard New Zealand 181 (58.2 overs) v Sri Lanka 184/7 (52.5 overs) Sri Lanka won by 3 wickets County Ground, Derby 20 June 1983 Scorecard Sri Lanka 136 (50.4 overs) v England 137/1 (2 contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 56 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/1983_Cricket_World_Cup responseCode 3 200
