Thanks. Archived discussion for January 2008 from Wikipedia:In the news section on the Main Page/Candidates. January 31 Prolonged snow storm in southern, central and eastern China brought 38 deaths and economic loss of 32.67 million Renminbi yuan. 161.7 million people were relocated. Heimm Old (talk) 18:47, 31 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] We need an updated article in the English Wikipedia. The topic is suitable.-gadfium 19:30, 31 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] 161.7 million people? That's like 10% of China's population!!! I seriously doubt this number is correct. Anyway, if the article is translated, I find it suitable for ITN. --Tone 08:44, 1 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] That was an error in translation. The latest figure according to China's Ministry of Civil Affairs is 1.759 million. Heimm Old (talk) 19:46, 1 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Hi. I'm rather new to this procedure, but anyway, I really think it should be included in the Main Page. Last time I checked, aka a few days ago, the news said at least 54 people have died. This is also the first big snowstorm in Shanghai, since what, 1984? Anyway, the Premier of China is promising that Internet (?) and train service will be fixed by Chinese New Year, so people can go home for the holidays. The article will probably need a lot of work, but anyway, I think this is a very important news story and should be in the Main Page. Thanks. ~AH1(TCU) 21:58, 1 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] How is this not on the main page yet? 10% of China's population has been affected (source:AFP). January 2008 Chinese winter storms is the English version. This had made international headlines for the past two weeks. Unlike any of the other mikey mouse news currently on the main page. Shapiro-israel (talk) 22:01, 1 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Hi. Anyway, I fixed the link to the English version. We need more interwikis!!! At least 63 people have died, and snow is falling very heavily as far south as Guangxi and Guangdong, which really isn't far from Hong Kong, this is unusual and definitely needs to be on the main page, global warming perhaps? Thanks. ~AH1(TCU) 22:04, 1 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] What does interwikis have anything do with it? Shapiro-israel (talk) 22:08, 1 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Snow is even falling on Taklamakan desert! Hundreds of millions of people are affected by this crisis. More than 160 cities and counties were still suffering power and water shortages. I don't know why this ain't on the main page. Is no administrator available for this. Shapiro-israel (talk) 22:10, 1 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] OMG! I mentioned interwikis because this article needs to be avalible in more languages, Sinple English, for example, is a good start. We also need images, such as the ones from the Chinese Wikipedia, given that they're not copyrighted (see talkpage for article). Can we get a free satellite image of the area, from NEXRAD maybe? Should we also mention some of the meteorological complications that resulted in this storm, and when forecasts expect it to end? This is like a predecessor from The Day After Tomorrow (in slow motion, of course)! Since many people will likely be reading it if it gets put on the main page, we need to improve the article a little, but I must say the author did a pretty good job. Also, I think someone may have mistranslated 万 (wan4), which means ten thousand, not million. Million would be 百万 (bai3 wan4). Thanks. ~AH1(TCU) 22:25, 1 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] I have no idea how to do any of those things you've said. Lol. But the Internet earthquake story above seems to have hardly any interwikis. Is it a criteria? Shapiro-israel (talk) 22:34, 1 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] I don't think it's a criteria, but I suggested it because an important topic like this deserves more versions in different languages so people in those languages can read it as well. Also, the Undersea Earthquake thing should have interwikis, because many of the affected areas speak Arabic, Hindi, Bengali, French, Urdu, etc. It's possible to take images from the places, making sure they are free, saving them to your computer, then uploading them here with the right liscence and a description. However, I can see you are a relatively new user, so I don't blame you for not knowing these complicated matters that are giving me a migrane because I have used the computer/TV too much today. Anyway, where are the admins? Please read this. Use your eyes to absorb the information and put it onto the kingdom of Main Page! Thanks. ~AH1(TCU) 22:43, 1 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Posted as Severe winter storms result in as many as 63 deaths across central and southern China. with the 'current' death toll from the article. --PFHLai (talk) 23:42, 1 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Well done sir for your efficiency. Shapiro-israel (talk) 00:07, 2 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] January 30 Cricketer Harbhajan Singh cleared by the ICC of racial abuse charges stemming from the Second Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy. --121.209.168.87 (talk) 23:59, 29 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] We had him up earlier and I don't think that it's necessary to include him again. SpencerT♦C 01:44, 30 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Agreed an unsurprising end to the whole sorry affair. The actual controversy was significant. This isn't. Nil Einne (talk) 19:05, 30 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] The Australian government has announced it will issue its first formal apology to Aboriginal people when parliament resumes next month. (a future event but I put it for consideration now. I think it should be ITN when it happens.) --Tone 19:45, 30 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] That has potential. What's the updated article?-gadfium 03:25, 31 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Stolen Generation, I suppose? No updates there yet. Maybe good for Feb.13th [1] if the wikipage is in good shape then. --PFHLai (talk) 06:01, 31 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] January 27 How about, "Gordon B. Hinckley, the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from 1995 to 2008, dies, aged 97." It seems notable due to the deaths-of-prominent-figures criterion. --Iamunknown 17:24, 28 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] He might meet the notability clause, but his death was not unexpected. ---CWY2190TC 17:42, 28 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] An unexpected death is not the only criterion for a listing on the main page; "the deceased was in a high ranking office of power at the time of death" is another, which this seems to meet. --Iamunknown 19:13, 28 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] We put Suharto up, so there really is no arguement we can give that isn't really hypocritical... However, we have one death up there already, which is enough, and Suharto outranks this guy in terms of notability, apparently. --Plasma Twa 2 (talk) 21:12, 28 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] I second the request to include this. When a man significantly affects the the daily lives of 13+ million people, that counts as significant, regardless of your beliefs. The third qualification for front page inclusion regarding deaths is "The modification or creation of multiple articles to take into account the ramifications of a death is a sign that it meets the third criterion." I can think of a dozen or more entries that will need to be updated due to his passing. Thus he qualifies for inclusion based on rule 1 and rule 3. The article isn't up to scratch yet, but is the event itself suitable for ITN? "The Pakistan Army regains control over the Kohat Tunnel in the North-West Frontier Province, which had been seized by pro-Taliban militants." AecisBrievenbus 19:56, 27 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Denmark wins the 2008 European Men's Handball Championship, beating Croatia 24 - 20. --Rimieh (talk) 17:00, 27 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Yeah, why not? There is no World Championships this year, and every world champion has been a European nation, so European champs are definately the top event in the world this year, and it is an international sport. Breaks the Anglophone interest domination. Kevin McE (talk) 17:19, 27 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Added. O linked the countries to the appropriate national teams. --Tone 17:30, 27 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Hold on. The European basketball championships were not added. A few are suggesting that the Australian Open should not be added, but we add the European Handball championships? ---CWY2190TC 17:34, 27 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] Well the European basketball championship doesn't involve all the top teams in the world. All the handball top teams appear to be in Europe so it's a somewhat different situation. Having said that, I don't agree with this. I don't mind having the World Championships for handball, but I disagree with the European ones even if they involve the top teams in the world they're still not the top level champsionship. I'm not that supportive of the Euro being on ITN either (although again that doesn't involve the top teams in the world) unless the result is really unusual and I strongly suspect football is a bigger sport in Denmark and Croatia then handball... If we really want to open up to more sports, how about we start having things like the top level of other sports, e.g. badminton (which is dominated largely by non anglophone countries), volleyball etc rather then including clearly non-top level championships... Nil Einne (talk) 18:07, 27 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply] I would question the relevance of whether football/soccer/Association football (don't go there) is bigger in the countries involved. If that criterion were applied, we would only ever have one of Baseball, Basketball, American Football and Ice Hockey!
