In set theory, Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, named after mathematicians Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel, is an axiomatic system that was proposed in the early twentieth century in order to formulate a theory of sets free of paradoxes such as Russell's paradox. Today, Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, with the historically controversial axiom of choice (AC) included, is the standard form of axiomatic set theory and as such is the most common foundation of mathematics. Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice included is abbreviated ZFC, where C stands for "choice",[1] and ZF refers to the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice excluded. Informally,[2] Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory is intended to formalize a single primitive notion, that of a hereditary well-founded set, so that all entities in the universe of discourse are such sets. Thus the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory refer only to pure sets and prevent its models from containing urelements (elements of sets that are not themselves sets). Furthermore, proper classes (collections of mathematical objects defined by a property shared by their members where the collections are too big to be sets) can only be treated indirectly. Specifically, Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory does not allow for the existence of a universal set (a set containing all sets) nor for unrestricted comprehension, thereby avoiding Russell's paradox. Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory (NBG) is a commonly used conservative extension of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory that does allow explicit treatment of proper classes. There are many equivalent formulations of the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. Most of the axioms state the existence of particular sets defined from other sets. For example, the axiom of pairing says that given any two sets a {\displaystyle a} and b {\displaystyle b} there is a new set { a , b } {\displaystyle \{a,b\}} containing exactly a {\displaystyle a} and b {\displaystyle b} . Other axioms describe properties of set membership. A goal of the axioms is that each axiom should be true if interpreted as a statement about the collection of all sets in the von Neumann universe (also known as the cumulative hierarchy). Formally, ZFC is a one-sorted theory in first-order logic. The signature has equality and a single primitive binary relation, intended to formalize set membership, which is usually denoted ∈ {\displaystyle \in } . The formula a ∈ b {\displaystyle a\in b} means that the set a {\displaystyle a} is a member of the set b {\displaystyle b} (which is also read, " a {\displaystyle a} is an element of b {\displaystyle b} " or " a {\displaystyle a} is in b {\displaystyle b} "). The metamathematics of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory has been extensively studied. Landmark results in this area established the logical independence of the axiom of choice from the remaining Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms (see Axiom of choice § Independence) and of the continuum hypothesis from ZFC. The consistency of a theory such as ZFC cannot be proved within the theory itself, as shown by Gödel's second incompleteness theorem. History[edit] Main article: History of set theory The modern study of set theory was initiated by Georg Cantor and Richard Dedekind in the 1870s. However, the discovery of paradoxes in naive set theory, such as Russell's paradox, led to the desire for a more rigorous form of set theory that was free of these paradoxes. In 1908, Ernst Zermelo proposed the first axiomatic set theory, Zermelo set theory. However, as first pointed out by Abraham Fraenkel in a 1921 letter to Zermelo, this theory was incapable of proving the existence of certain sets and cardinal numbers whose existence was taken for granted by most set theorists of the time, notably the cardinal number ℵ ω {\displaystyle \aleph _{\omega }} and the set { Z 0 , P ( Z 0 ) , P ( P ( Z 0 ) ) , P ( P ( P ( Z 0 ) ) ) , . . . } , {\displaystyle \{Z_{0},{\mathcal {P}}(Z_{0}),{\mathcal {P}}({\mathcal {P}}(Z_{0})),{\mathcal {P}}({\mathcal {P}}({\mathcal {P}}(Z_{0}))),...\},} where Z 0 {\displaystyle Z_{0}} is any infinite set and P {\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}} is the power set operation.[3] Moreover, one of Zermelo's axioms invoked a concept, that of a "definite" property, whose operational meaning was not clear. In 1922, Fraenkel and Thoralf Skolem independently proposed operationalizing a "definite" property as one that could be formulated as a well-formed formula in a first-order logic whose atomic formulas were limited to set membership and identity. They also independently proposed replacing the axiom schema of specification with the axiom schema of replacement. Appending this schema, as well as the axiom of regularity (first proposed by John von Neumann),[4] to Zermelo set theory yields the theory denoted by ZF. Adding to ZF either the axiom of choice (AC) or a statement that is equivalent to it yields ZFC. Axioms[edit] See also: Axiom There are many equivalent formulations of the ZFC axioms; for a discussion of this, see Fraenkel, Bar-Hillel & Lévy 1973. The following particular axiom set is from Kunen (1980). The axioms per se are expressed in the symbolism of first order logic. The associated English prose is only intended to aid the intuition. Axioms 1-8 form ZF, while the axiom 9 turns ZF into ZFC. Following Kunen (1980), we use the equivalent well-ordering theorem in place of the axiom of choice for axiom 9. All formulations of ZFC imply that at least one set exists. Kunen includes an axiom that directly asserts the existence of a set, in addition to the axioms given below (although he notes that he does so only "for emphasis").[5] Its omission here can be justified in two ways. First, in the standard semantics of first-order logic in which ZFC is typically formalized, the domain of discourse must be nonempty. Hence, it is a logical theorem of first-order logic that something exists — usually expressed as the assertion that something is identical to itself, ∃ x ( x = x ) {\displaystyle \exists x(x=x)} . Consequently, it is a theorem of every first-order theory that something exists. However, as noted above, because in the intended semantics of ZFC, there are only sets, the interpretation of this logical theorem in the context of ZFC is that some set exists. Hence, there is no need for a separate axiom asserting that a set exists. Second, however, even if ZFC is formulated in so-called free logic, in which it is not provable from logic alone that something exists, the axiom of infinity (below) asserts that an infinite set exists. This implies that a set exists, and so, once again, it is superfluous to include an axiom asserting as much. 1. Axiom of extensionality[edit] Main article: Axiom of extensionality Two sets are equal (are the same set) if they have the same elements. ∀ x ∀ y [ ∀ z ( z ∈ x ⇔ z ∈ y ) ⇒ x = y ] . {\displaystyle \forall x\forall y[\forall z(z\in x\Leftrightarrow z\in y)\Rightarrow x=y].} The converse of this axiom follows from the substitution property of equality. ZFC is constructed in first-order logic. Some formulations of first-order logic include identity; others do not. If the variety of first-order logic in which you are constructing set theory does not include equality " = {\displaystyle =} ", x = y {\displaystyle x=y} may be defined as an abbreviation for the following formula:[6] ∀ z [ z ∈ x ⇔ z ∈ y ] ∧ ∀ w [ x ∈ w ⇔ y ∈ w ] . {\displaystyle \forall z[z\in x\Leftrightarrow z\in y]\land \forall w[x\in w\Leftrightarrow y\in w].} In this case, the axiom of extensionality can be reformulated as ∀ x ∀ y [ ∀ z ( z ∈ x ⇔ z ∈ y ) ⇒ ∀ w ( x ∈ w ⇔ y ∈ w ) ] , {\displaystyle \forall x\forall y[\forall z(z\in x\Leftrightarrow z\in y)\Rightarrow \forall w(x\in w\Leftrightarrow y\in w)],} which says that if x {\displaystyle x} and y {\displaystyle y} have the same elements, then they belong to the same sets.[7] 2. Axiom of regularity (also called the axiom of foundation)[edit] Main article: Axiom of regularity Every non-empty set x {\displaystyle x} contains a member y {\displaystyle y} such that x {\displaystyle x} and y {\displaystyle y} are disjoint sets. ∀ x [ ∃ a ( a ∈ x ) ⇒ ∃ y ( y ∈ x ∧ ¬ ∃ z ( z ∈ y ∧ z ∈ x ) ) ] . {\displaystyle \forall x[\exists a(a\in x)\Rightarrow \exists y(y\in x\land \lnot \exists z(z\in y\land z\in x))].} [8] or in modern notation: ∀ x ( x ≠ ∅ ⇒ ∃ y ( y ∈ x ∧ y ∩ x = ∅ ) ) . {\displaystyle \forall x\,(x\neq \varnothing \Rightarrow \exists y(y\in x\land y\cap x=\varnothing )).} This (along with the axiom of pairing) implies, for example, that no set is an element of itself and that every set has an ordinal rank. 3. Axiom schema of specification (or of separation, or of restricted comprehension)[edit] Main article: Axiom schema of specification Subsets are commonly constructed using set builder notation. For example, the even integers can be constructed as the subset of the integers Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } satisfying the congruence modulo predicate x ≡ 0 ( mod 2 ) {\displaystyle x\equiv 0{\pmod {2}}} : { x ∈ Z : x ≡ 0 ( mod 2 ) } . {\displaystyle \{x\in \mathbb {Z} :x\equiv 0{\pmod {2}}\}.} In general, the subset of a set z {\displaystyle z} obeying a formula φ ( x ) {\displaystyle \varphi (x)} with one free variable x {\displaystyle x} may be written as: { x ∈ z : φ ( x ) } . {\displaystyle \{x\in z:\varphi (x)\}.} The axiom schema of specification states that this subset always exists (it is an axiom schema because there is one axiom for each φ {\displaystyle \varphi } ). Formally, let φ {\displaystyle \varphi } be any formula in the language of ZFC with all free variables among x , z , w 1 , … , w n {\displaystyle x,z,w_{1},\ldots ,w_{n}} ( y {\displaystyle y} is not free in φ {\displaystyle \varphi } ). Then: ∀ z ∀ w 1 ∀ w 2 … ∀ w n ∃ y ∀ x [ x ∈ y ⇔ ( ( x ∈ z ) ∧ φ ( x , w 1 , w 2 , . . . , w n , z ) ) ] . {\displ contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 37 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/ZFC responseCode 3 200
