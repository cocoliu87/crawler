S. Byatt (/ˈbaɪ.ət/ BY-ət),[1] was an English critic, novelist, poet and short story writer. Her books have been translated into more than thirty languages.[2][3] After attending the University of Cambridge, she married in 1959 and moved to Durham. It was during Byatt's time at university that she began working on her first two novels, subsequently published by Chatto & Windus as Shadow of a Sun (1964; reprinted in 1991 with its originally intended title, The Shadow of the Sun) and The Game (1967). Byatt took a teaching job in 1972 to help pay for the education of her son. In the same week she accepted, a drunk driver killed her son as he walked home from school. He was 11 years of age. Byatt spent a symbolic 11 years teaching, then began full-time writing in 1983. The Virgin in the Garden (1978) was the first of The Quartet,[4] a tetralogy of novels that continued with Still Life (1985), Babel Tower (1996) and A Whistling Woman (2002). Byatt's novel Possession: A Romance received the 1990 Booker Prize, while her short story collection The Djinn in the Nightingale's Eye (1994) received the 1995 Aga Khan Prize for Fiction. Her novel The Children's Book was shortlisted for the 2009 Booker Prize and won the 2010 James Tait Black Memorial Prize. Her critical work includes two studies of Dame Iris Murdoch (who was a friend and mentor), Degrees of Freedom: The Early Novels of Iris Murdoch (1965) and Iris Murdoch: A Critical Study (1976). Her other critical studies include Wordsworth and Coleridge in Their Time (1970) and Portraits in Fiction (2001). Byatt was awarded the Shakespeare Prize in 2002, the Erasmus Prize in 2016, the Park Kyong-ni Prize in 2017 and the Hans Christian Andersen Literature Award in 2018. She was mentioned as a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature.[5] Early life Antonia Susan Drabble was born in Sheffield, England, on 24 August 1936,[6] as the eldest child of John Frederick Drabble, QC, later a County Court judge, and Kathleen Bloor, a scholar of Browning.[7] Her sisters are the novelist Margaret Drabble and the art historian Helen Langdon. Her brother Richard Drabble KC is a barrister.[8] The Drabble father participated in the placement of Jewish refugees in Sheffield during the 1930s.[9] The mother was a Shavian and the father a Quaker.[9] As a result of the bombing of Sheffield during the Second World War the family moved to York.[10] Byatt was educated at two independent boarding schools, Sheffield High School and The Mount School, a Quaker boarding school at York. She noted in an interview in 2009, "I am not a Quaker, of course, because I'm anti-Christian and the Quakers are a form of Christianity but their religion is wonderful—you simply sat in silence and listened to the nature of things."[7] A "deeply unhappy" child, Byatt did not enjoy boarding school, citing her need to be alone and her difficulty in making friends.[7] Severe asthma often kept her in bed where reading became an escape from a difficult household.[11] She attended Newnham College, Cambridge, Bryn Mawr College (in the United States), and Somerville College, Oxford.[6][12] Having studied French, German, Latin and English at school, she later studied Italian while attending Cambridge so that she could read Dante.[2] "This means that I can actually read European literature with its own rhythms even if I have to have a side-by-side text for the difficult bits", she said in 1998.[2] Byatt lectured in the Department of Extra-Mural Studies of the University of London (1962–71),[6] the Central School of Art and Design and from 1972 to 1983 at University College London.[6] She began writing full-time in 1983.[13] Personal life Byatt married Ian Charles Rayner Byatt in 1959 and moved to Durham.[2] They had a daughter together,[14] as well as a son, Charles, who was killed by a drunk-driver at the age of 11 while walking home from school.[2][7][10] She spoke of her son's death and its influence on her lecturing and subsequent career after publishing The Children's Book, in which the image of a dead child features: Byatt said she wished to become a full-time writer, but "if I had a job we could send my son to a fee-paying school. My son got killed on Frank Kermode's doorstep, the day I accepted the job more or less—so there was no point in having the job except what else was I going to do".[2][7] Byatt stayed in the job for "as long as he had lived, which was 11 years", then, she said, "it was like being released from a spell".[2][7] She came to regard her academic career "very symbolically".[2] She later wrote the poem "Dead Boys".[7] The marriage was dissolved in 1969. Later that year, Byatt married Peter Duffy, and they had two daughters.[15][7][14] Byatt's relationship with her sister Margaret Drabble was sometimes strained due to the presence of autobiographical elements in both their writing. While their relationship was no longer especially close and they did not read each other's books, Drabble described the situation as "normal sibling rivalry"[16] and Byatt said it had been "terribly overstated by gossip columnists" and that the sisters "always have liked each other on the bottom line."[17] Byatt was an agnostic, though she maintained an affinity for Quaker services.[10][15] She enjoyed watching snooker, tennis, and football.[15][18] Byatt lived primarily in Putney, and died at home on 16 November 2023, at the age of 87.[15][19][20] Influences Byatt was influenced by Henry James[2] and George Eliot[7][10] as well as Emily Dickinson,[10] T. S. Eliot, Coleridge,[10] Tennyson[7] and Robert Browning,[7] in merging realism and naturalism with fantasy. She was not an admirer of the Brontë family, admitting to finding their "joint imagination absolutely appalling".[2] Nor did she like Christina Rossetti.[10] She was ambivalent about D. H. Lawrence and also stated: "I don't like the English gentlemanly high-church sort of refined person, except for George Herbert, who is perfect and unexpected".[2] She knew Jane Austen's work off by heart before her teens.[10] In her books, Byatt alluded to, and built upon, themes from Romantic and Victorian literature.[6] She cited art historian John Gage's book on the theory of colour as one of her favourite books to reread.[2] Frank Kermode she regarded as "writing criticism about a literature that one might hope to add things to. In a way, what Kermode said William Golding and Lawrence Durrell were doing was more important to me than what Golding or Durrell were doing", Byatt said in her interview for The Paris Review's "The Art of Fiction" series.[2] Writing Fiction Byatt wrote a lot while attending boarding school but had most of it burnt before she left.[2] She began writing her first novel while at the University of Cambridge, where she did not attend many lectures but when she did, she passed the time attempting to write a novel, which—given her limited experience of life—involved a young woman at university trying to write a novel, a novel, her novel, which—she knew—was "no good".[2] She left it in a drawer when she was finished.[2] After departing Cambridge, she spent one year as a postgraduate student in the United States and began her second novel, The Game, continuing to write it at Oxford when she returned to England.[2] After getting married in 1959 and moving to Durham, she left The Game aside and resumed work on her earlier novel.[2] She sent it to literary critic John Beer, whom she had befriended while at Cambridge and, she later said, "whose ideas, I think, run through almost everything I write".[2] Beer sent Byatt's novel to the independent book publishing company Chatto & Windus.[2] From there Cecil Day-Lewis wrote her a response and invited her to lunch at The Athenaeum, where he shared his thoughts on "poetry and Yeats and Auden and Shakespeare, and it was the literary conversation I had never had. When we got out on the pavement I rather tremblingly said, Might you be thinking of publishing this novel? He said, Oh yes, of course, of course".[2] Day-Lewis was Byatt's first editor; D. J. Enright would succeed him.[10] Shadow of a Sun, Byatt's first novel, is about a girl and her father and was published in 1964.[6] It was reprinted in 1991 with its originally intended title, The Shadow of the Sun, intact.[2] The Game, published in 1967, concerned the dynamics between two sisters.[6] The reception for Byatt's first books became confused with her sister's writing; her sister had a quicker rate of publication.[2] The family theme is continued in The Quartet,[21] Byatt's tetralogy of novels, which begins with The Virgin in the Garden (1978) and continues with Still Life (1985), Babel Tower (1996) and A Whistling Woman (2002).[6] Her quartet is inspired by D. H. Lawrence, particularly The Rainbow and Women in Love. The family portrayed in the quartet are from Yorkshire.[6] Byatt said the idea for The Virgin in the Garden came in part from an extramural class she taught in which she had read Tolstoy and Dostoevsky and in part from her time living in Durham in 1961, the year in which her son was born.[2] The book was an attempt to understand what could be achieved if Middlemarch were written in the middle of the twentieth century.[2] Byatt's book features a powerful death contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 45 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/A._S._Byatt responseCode 3 200
