Usually navboxes are either arranged in horizontal lists at the bottom, or vertical lists at the top (as an infobox-type navbox), I have not seen bottom navboxes with vertical lists. Another idea may be to "split" the navbox into specific navboxes that may be show or hidden, as done with {{American Civil War}} (which may also give new ideas of similar articles that may be written about this civil war, such as war theaters or "Argentine civil war at X province"). This allows to write really big navboxes without becoming overwhelming MBelgrano (talk) 12:50, 28 September 2010 (UTC)Reply[reply] That's an option. But this template would be allowed, as it is based on a current one (Template:Colombia conflict).
