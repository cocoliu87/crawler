However, there is also an entry added to the page's edit history - look for "moved page" in the edit summary. --Redrose64 üåπ (talk) 12:32, 12 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Advice wanted: when should pageant articles be created[edit] I noticed today that Miss International 2024 has been created, but it doesn't exist yet on the sponsor's website [1], and there's nothing in the article indicating even a possible date or venue. Seems premature to me, is there any consensus on this? ‚òÜ Bri (talk) 04:24, 13 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Just the usual, @Bri: all events that interest "me" should be created immediately, and all events that "I" think are unimportant should be created at the last minute. I believe the official rule is that you need to know, with reasonable certainty, that the event will happen. Since the article is the next event, it's not unreasonable for it to exist.

There is an issue with the current events page but the talk page is blocked so I am reporting here. In the current events of Nov 2012 page (link below), the following paragraph exists: '"The World Health Organization says that there are reports that people who fled Gaza‚Äôs Al-Shifa hospital ‚Äúhave been shot at, wounded and even killed‚Äù' While the linked WHO report does complain about the hospital conditions, I could not find that it mentions shooting those who are being evacuated. Here is the report which is one of the references: https://www.emro.who.int/media/news/who-loses-communication-with-contacts-in-al-shifa-hospital-in-gaza-amid-reports-of-attacks.html Although Wikipedia relies primarily on secondary sources, I think this paragraph must either be removed or a primary source must be added because it is seemingly a direct quote. Furthermore, in case this quote never came out of WHO, then the user needs to clarify their intentions. Here is the diff which added it: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:MobileDiff/1184774867 Here is a message I added to the user talk page: "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SkylarEstrada#source_of_your_claim_about_WHO's_report_in_Current_Events_Nov_12 109.253.209.80 (talk) 07:45, 13 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] @109.253.209.80: The source you linked has the quote "There are reports that some people who fled the hospital have been shot at, wounded and even killed." This is the source of the quote from your snippet. PiGuy3 (talk) 07:51, 13 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] The wording is critical. The wording in current news is 'The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that people who fled the hospital "have been shot at, wounded and even killed"' which is false. The WHO is not claiming this as a primary source, it is only saying there are reports of this. 109.253.209.80 (talk) 08:14, 13 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] @109.253.209.80: Please use Template:Reply_to when replying, thanks. PiGuy3 (talk) 08:46, 13 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] I do apologize for not clarifying that the quote in a slightly different form does indeed exist in the source I linked. But as I said, the difference is critical. 109.253.209.80 (talk) 08:21, 13 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] The original WHO article says that there are merely reports of people being shot as they leave. The WHO never claimed that the WHO itself has evidence that these reports are at true The current news article has had this very midleading wording at some point: The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that people who fled the hospital "have been shot at, wounded and even killed ... And as I wrote this complaint it has changed to the more accurate The World Health Organization says that there are reports that people who fled Gaza‚Äôs Al-Shifa hospital ‚Äúhave been shot at, wounded and even killed‚Äù And I think it is changing back and fourth but am too inexperienced to understand what's going on 109.253.209.80 (talk) 08:28, 13 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Update: I have misread the current news. The article does not claim that the WHO directly reports on this, rather, the who itself says "there are reports that", I think this is delicate and needs to be reworded to avoid misreading. ‚Äî Preceding unsigned comment added by 109.253.209.80 (talk) 07:50, 13 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] I have changed the statement back to the accurate version. Phil Bridger (talk) 08:41, 13 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] ultimate clarification regarding Nov 12[edit] Hello. I am starting from scratch because I have confused the structure previous thread making it hard to follow, and the article changed as I copy pasted atuff, causing confusion for me and others. Here is my ultimate clarification Summary: WHO said there are merely reports of people being shot as they leave hospital. WHO did not say it verified those reports and the original reports did not originate from WHO. Source: https://www.emro.who.int/media/news/who-loses-communication-with-contacts-in-al-shifa-hospital-in-gaza-amid-reports-of-attacks.html At some point, the Wiki wording was misleading, making a far stronger claim, it said 'The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that people who fled the hospital "have been shot at, wounded and even killed', implying this is WHO-verified The wording is changing back and fourth to the softer 'The World Health Organization says that there are reports that people who fled Gaza‚Äôs Al-Shifa hospital ‚Äúhave been shot at, wounded and even killed‚Äù' It has changed as I wrote the previous article, making me confuse my copy-pastes. Making me believe I have misread. Background: The distinction is very important in this conflict, as the Israeli side is denying shooting civilians that leave the hospital, and the first wording implies that the WHO, a reliable source, is saying that civilians are getting shot, but it is not saying so. Wikipedia ought not take sides before there are concrete evidence. I think that even the second variation "The WHO says there are reports..." gives the current reports more weight than the deserve, every knows there are reports, and prefixing it with the WHO is redundant and gives an air of credibility that isn't yet there. To take an extreme example, consider the following quote: "the WHO says there are reports that covid vaccines cause autism", this is absolutely true, the WHO would never deny there are *reports* like that, but the phrasing gives the impression that the WHO supports the claim, when in fact it does not. original bad wording in this diff: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:MobileDiff/1184774867 109.253.209.80 (talk) 08:43, 13 November 2023 (UTC contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 72 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_(miscellaneous) responseCode 3 200
