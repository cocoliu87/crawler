The kibbutz had 400 residents prior to the attack, and it took two days for the Israel Defense Forces to wrest back full control of the community.[2][3][4] While the exact total of Israelis killed is yet unknown, as of 15 October 52 are listed as dead, and a further 20 or more missing.[5][6] The attack is notable for claims of brutality in the form of beheadings,[2] dismemberment, and victims having been burned alive.[7][8] There has been controversy regarding unconfirmed claims by Israeli sources that babies were decapitated.[3][9][10] Massacre Kefar Aza prior to the massacre About 70 Hamas gunmen broke through a fence and gained access to the kibbutz on the morning of 7 October 2023.[11] After entering the kibbutz, which was 3 kilometers (1.9 mi) from Gaza, the militants proceeded to massacre residents of the community.[11] The Islamist militants began by targeting the west side of the community—an area in the kibbutz close to Gaza - where families with young children lived.[12][13] Fifty two people at the kibbutz are known to have been killed.[5] Members of the kibbutz with military training, who formed a volunteer armed guard, fought against invading militants in an attempt to defend the community.[13] All were killed. Hamas militants broadened the attack to all four directions.[12] Invading militants burned houses and killed civilian residents.[14][15][16] Corpses of those who had lived in the community were found with their hands tied.[16] In addition, the militants took hostages from the kibbutz.[17][18] The Associated Press visually confirmed four hostages who were abducted on 7 October.[19] The militants took women, children and senior citizens among the hostages back to Gaza.[20] Israeli Major General Itai Veruv described the massacre as a terror attack.[17] Prior to the massacre, the community had 400 residents. It took the Israel Defense Forces two and a half days to regain full control of the community after the initial attack.[13] The paratroopers of Unit 71 led the assault to retake the community,[21] and the Duvdevan Unit also responded to the attack.[6] Journalists were granted access to the site on 10 October 2023.[22][17] Hamas has also released video footage of the attack.[23] Casualties See also: Denial of atrocities during the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel According to BBC News, it appears that most of the victims of the massacre died in the opening hours of the attack. As of 10 October 2023[update], soldiers were still going through the community to recover bodies.[24] According to one soldier present, several civilians had been beheaded.[9] Other victims were dismembered or burned.[8] Children and babies were reported to be among the killed.[2][3] Allegations of beheadings See also: Disinformation in the 2023 Israel–Hamas war One member of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) who had responded to the site said in an interview with i24NEWS that 40 children had been killed, with some beheaded by Hamas.[25][22] CBS News later interviewed Yossi Landau, regional head of the first responder organization ZAKA, who said that both babies and minors had been beheaded alongside corpses of dismembered adults.[2] Landau later stated to Sky News that 80% of the bodies at Kfar Aza and at Be'eri showed signs of torture.[26] A statement that a number of babies were decapitated was also made by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesperson, and the most high-profile claim was repeated by U.S. President Joe Biden, who claimed to have seen photographic evidence for it.[27][28] The White House later denied Biden had seen photographic images, and clarified that he was referring to media reports and statements by Netanyahu.[3][28] The IDF stated to Business Insider that they would not investigate the allegation further, asserting that it would be "disrespectful for the dead" to do so.[29] Netanyahu's office released photos of dead babies, saying they were killed and burned in the attack.[30] The Jerusalem Post stated that these images which were posted on Twitter/X and shown to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, confirmed that babies were decapitated,[4] while NBC News stated that the claim could not be independently verified and that no photographic evidence that babies were decapitated was provided.[3] CNN reported that claims of beheading could not be confirmed.[10] Nevertheless, the reporter from i24NEWS maintains her stance, affirming that she personally witnessed the gruesome scenes.[31] Forensic investigators said that they had seen evidence of decapitated people, including babies, but stated that it was unclear whether the decapitations happened before or after death, and that the decapitations could have resulted from the use of rocket propelled grenades, rather than as a result of intentional cutting with a blade.[32][33] The claim that 40 babies had been decapitated gained widespread attention on social media, with over 40 million impressions on X (formerly Twitter), propagated by the Israeli website i24NEWS and the official Israel account. The news made it to the front-page news on almost a dozen British newspapers. NBC News stated that the report was likely erroneous, and based on the conflation of two separate statements made by IDF soldiers.[3] Dead baby in oven claim During the transport of bodies for autopsy, two first responders with Hatzalah said that they encountered the corpse of a baby with oven marks on its body in the remains of a burnt house, and the organization's president spoke about the incident publicly for the first time at the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas in late October. Hatzalah's president stated that it was unknown how the baby made it into the oven, and suggested it was possible the parents of the child had placed the baby in the oven in an attempt to protect it from the fire, rather than the baby being deliberately placed in the oven by the Hamas attackers.[34] Survivors Ziv Stahl, executive director of the human rights organization Yesh Din, survived the massacre and later, in an article for Haaretz, strongly opposed calls to exact revenge, arguing that,'Indiscriminate bombing in Gaza and the killing of civilians uninvolved with these horrible crimes are no solution.'[35] Another survivor, Avidor Schwartzman, described how he hid with his wife and one year-old daughter in their safe room for over 20 hours until their rescue by Israeli soldiers. "There were bodies everywhere. Dead bodies everywhere," the 38-year-old said. "We saw our little piece of paradise, our little piece of heaven, was totally burnt – burnt and with blood everywhere."[36] See also List of massacres during the 2023 Israel-Hamas war Outline of the 2023 Israel–Hamas war Disinformation in the 2023 Israel–Hamas war Palestinian terrorism Moshe Dayan's eulogy for Ro'i Rothberg References ^ "IDF: Dozens of rockets fired from Lebanon, at least nine crossed into Israeli territory".
