The geoid is essentially the figure of the Earth abstracted from its topographic features. It is an idealized equilibrium surface of sea water, the mean sea level surface in the absence of currents, air pressure variations etc. and continued under the continental masses. The geoid, unlike the ellipsoid, is irregular and too complicated to serve as the computational surface on which to solve geometrical problems like point positioning. The geometrical separation between it and the reference ellipsoid is called the geoidal undulation, or more usually the geoid-ellipsoid separation, N. It varies globally between ±110 m. A reference ellipsoid, customarily chosen to be the same size (volume) as the geoid, is described by its semi-major axis (equatorial radius) a and flattening f. The quantity f = (a−b)/a, where b is the semi-minor axis (polar radius), is a purely geometrical one. The mechanical ellipticity of the earth (dynamical flattening, symbol J2) is determined to high precision by observation of satellite orbit perturbations. Its relationship with the geometric flattening is indirect. The relationship depends on the internal density distribution. The 1980 Geodetic Reference System (GRS 80) posited a 6378137 m semi-major axis and a 1⁄298.257222101 flattening. This system was adopted at the XVII General Assembly of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) in Canberra, Australia, 1979. The GRS 80 reference system was originally used by the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84). The reference ellipsoid of WGS 84 now differs slightly due to later refinements. The numerous other systems which have been used by diverse countries for their maps and charts are gradually dropping out of use as more and more countries move to global, geocentric reference systems using the GRS80 reference ellipsoid. Definition[edit] The reference ellipsoid is usually defined by its semi-major axis (equatorial radius) a {\displaystyle a} and either its semi-minor axis (polar radius) b {\displaystyle b} , aspect ratio ( b / a ) {\displaystyle (b/a)} or flattening f {\displaystyle f} , but GRS80 is an exception: four independent constants are required for a complete definition. GRS80 chooses as these a {\displaystyle a} , G M {\displaystyle GM} , J 2 {\displaystyle J_{2}} and ω {\displaystyle \omega } , making the geometrical constant f {\displaystyle f} a derived quantity.
