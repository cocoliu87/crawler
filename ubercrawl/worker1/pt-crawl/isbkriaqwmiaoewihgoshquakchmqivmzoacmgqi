Thanks. Archived discussion for July 2007 from Wikipedia:In the news section on the Main Page/Candidates. July 31 I'm afraid I haven't got the time to expand or create the articles right now, but someone definitely should write about United Nations Security Council Resolution 1769, which approved the United Nations African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID, will complement and then replace the African Union Mission in Sudan), so that we can add it to the news -- this is absolutely MAJOR news! —Nightstallion 23:20, 31 July 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] BTW, source: http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2007/sc9089.doc.htm —Nightstallion 23:21, 31 July 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Similarly, the conclusion of Operation Banner and the Northern Ireland peace process may be another good topic. But someone has to put in more text before this gets onto ITN. --PFHLai 07:14, 1 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Ditto for the lethal rainstorms and devastating floods in China, India and Bangladesh, I suppose. Also major news. No articles yet. --PFHLai 17:56, 1 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] UNAMID is now posted on ITN. (not by me) Still waiting for the floods, though... --PFHLai 23:29, 2 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Yeah, that was my, by the same reason as you posted the South Korean hostage crisis. I'd say write up a short article about the floods (2007 South Asian floods, I suppose) and simply post it, I doubt there'll be objections. —Nightstallion 12:25, 3 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] A second South Korean aid worker taken hostage by the Taliban in Afghanistan is confirmed dead. --PFHLai 07:34, 2 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Posted, as no one objects.... the article is a bit short, but it's the best new ITN-relevant article I could find right now. --PFHLai 18:09, 2 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] July 30 The Romanian Orthodox Church Partiarch, Teoctist Arăpaşu, dies of cardiac complications during operation for prostate adenoma. Strong support. Reason for including: High-ranking official and Church leader. --Danielsavoiu 14:43, 30 July 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] As per Bergman below, generally ITN is not an obituary, but being the Orthodox Patriarch does satisfy criteria#5. However the article hasn't been updated beyond one unreferenced line. We need a substantially updated and verified article to include in ITN. --Monotonehell 16:30, 30 July 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Now the article contains referenced information about the Patriarch's death. As per #5, the Patriarch is an analogue of the Pope (whose death was duly announced in ITN), though religiously ruling in only one country, so I do not see any reason it contravenes #5: The deceased was in a high ranking office of power at the time of death. This is true, he was the religious ruler of all romanian orthodox christians. The deceased died unexpectedly, as it was expected for him to recover. --Danielsavoiu 11:14, 31 July 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I've added an english language reference and removed a broken Romanian one. The article needs a bit of a tidy up. Getting near ready for ITN. --Monotonehell 11:38, 31 July 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Ingmar Bergman The Swedish stage and film director Ingmar Bergman, one of the key film auteurs of the 20th century, dies at Fårö. Yes, I know ITN is not generally meant for obituaries, but Bergman was Bergman after all... --Camptown 09:14, 30 July 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I strongly support putting this on the in the news section. Very notable and a great loss to Sweden and the world. I already put this request on the main page talk page--Ted-m 11:55, 30 July 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] We still haven't had a consensus to change criteria#5, if we had I'd endorse this one. --Monotonehell 12:48, 30 July 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I really donk't think we need to change any criteria, but use some common sense. If Boris Yeltsin made it to the front page (more than 7 years after leaving office), so should Ingmar Bergman. --Bondkaka 14:03, 30 July 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I understand that he actually might have died unexpectedly. Bergman was certainly an old fellow, but when I look at the Swedish media reaction, his death came rather unexpectedly - like a sudden earth quake. So the question is (if that's an absolute requirement, no matter what...): Did Bergman die according to rule no. 5? --Camptown 14:33, 30 July 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I'm a lover of film, but I think it's best this not be posted. Criteria 5 can sting at times, especially when it might look like it's slighting a great man, but its the only thing saving us from endless debates, like, for instance, if Tom Snyder met the requirements. The Tom 13:29, 30 July 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Very strong support. We cannot dismiss this utmost important item just because Bergman didn't perish in a car accident. Don't forget that Bergman was active until his death, and he one of very few 20th century giants in theatre and film. The news of his death covers most of the front page of today's The New York Times, but here (at WP:ITN) people are whining (excuse me!) about formalistic criterias that he didn't die the "right way". --Bondkaka 13:56, 30 July 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Even if we come to the conclusion that Bergman's death should over ride criteria#5 the update to the article simply says that he died. That means that the item currently fails Criteria #1, #2, possibly #4 as well as #5. Can the article be improved beyond its current state or is there no more information available? (Nb criteria #1 might be satisfied by the entry on Deaths in 2007 instead?) --Monotonehell 14:42, 30 July 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I strongly recommend putting Ingmar Bergman's death on the front page. His artistic genius was the equal to Picasso or Kafka. I don't see anything in paragraph 5 to stop us from publishing. abelson 18:39, 30 July 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I would say that the problem is not necessarily #5, as everyone respects the career and impact of Bergman, and it's true that he was still (technically) active in film, but the lack of updates to his article. There's a single sentence about his death, and it doesn't even say if he died of old age or from some sort of illness. I can't support putting an article on ITN that has had so little updating (and I've looked in the history- there are a hundred edits in the past twelve hours, but not one of them has been substantial). -- Kicking222 01:35, 31 July 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] "ITN items link to encyclopedia articles that have been updated to reflect an important current event; it does not act as a newspaper, nor does it link to news articles...." (from Wikipedia:In the news section on the Main Page) To get an item about someone's death onto ITN, the article about the deceased must be updated with some prose (a short paragraph, maybe), plus references, about the death, right ? I can only find a single sentence about when and where -- not even the cause of death -- in the Ingmar Bergman article. I'll pass. No need to think about criterion #5 yet. Thanks. --PFHLai 01:45, 31 July 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I don't know why the death of Boris Yeltsin was on the Main Page while the passing away of such giants as Bergman and Michelangelo Antonioni is glossed over on some formalistic grounds. Please remember that Wikipedia is not consistent, by definition. --Ghirla-трёп- 15:16, 2 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Maybe these two giants of modern cinema (they died the same day) could at least share a hook? --Camptown 20:57, 2 August 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] July 29 Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's Liberal Democratic Party loses elections to the upper house of the Diet in a landslide; the opposition Democratic Party of Japan becomes the largest party in the upper house. This is probably the biggest news story of the day. This may eventually precipitate Abe's resignation, though as of now it's just a major repudiation of the party that has run Japan almost continuously for over fifty years... Lockesdonkey 21:11, 29 July 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Support, but try to shorten the hook, and avoid terms such as "landslide". --Camptown 22:03, 29 July 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] OK, how about this: Elections to the House of Councillors in Japan return a defeat for the the Liberal Democratic Party of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The opposition Democratic Party of Japan wins a majority in the upper house of the Diet. Lockesdonkey 02:48, 30 July 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] The Iraq national football team defeats Saudi Arabia 1–0 in the final of the 2007 AFC Asian Cup. Major news story, since it's the final of a major tournament. And there is also the human interest side of things with Iraq. – Chacor 15:43, 29 July 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Interesting, but how "major" is a soccer tournament where Iraq and Saudi Arabia play the final? --Bondkaka 17:54, 29 July 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] In itself not so much, but the fact that Iraq has reached and won the final has received a lot of attention. If Saudi Arabia had faced any other country, I would have had more doubts. AecisBrievenbus 18:15, 29 July 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I find it rather ridiculous that you're discriminating the Asian Cup final to be 'minor' just because Iraq and Saudi Arabia were in it. As the regional tournament it is on a par with the European Championships, or Copa America, or any other continental-based national tournament. – Chacor 01:24, 30 July 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] But if Wikipedia is not a newspaper, the isolated fact that the event received some attention is rather irrelevant. It may sound cynical: but only if the event brought with it more important implications (such as policy change or security concerns etc) it should go up. Bondkaka 19:33, 29 July 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] The celebrations after reaching the final were overshadowed by several suicide bombings among jubilant crowds, killing about 50 people contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 76 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Wikipedia:In_the_news/Candidates/July_2007 responseCode 3 200
