Its stated capacity is 25,000,[1] although grass terracing makes up part of the viewing area. The 'end names' are the Umgeni End (north) and the Old Fort Road End (south). It is the home ground of the Hollywoodbets Dolphins. In October 2019, Hollywoodbets was announced as the naming rights sponsor to the ground, with it now being known as Hollywoodbets Kingsmead Stadium until August 2024.[2] Cricket[edit] The venue hosted the first home Test for the South African cricket team after re-admission into international cricket and also hosted the Test against the English cricket team in 1939, which lasted from the third to the thirteenth of March and was called off over fears that the English would miss their ship home. The first Test match to be played here was between South Africa and England on 18 January 1923, which resulted in a draw on the 5th day It has been renowned as a seamers wicket, and there is also a famous myth regarding how the tide affects batting conditions, as the ground is quite close to the beach. Many batting collapses in matches in the past have jokingly been blamed on changes in the tide.[citation needed] On 19 September 2007 the ground witnessed Yuvraj Singh's iconic six consecutive sixes off Stuart Broad's over in the World Twenty20 match between India and England, to mark the fastest fifty ever in any form of cricket.[3] A panoramic view of the Kingsmead during South Africa vs Australia in 2009 See also[edit] List of Test cricket grounds List of international cricket five-wicket hauls at Kingsmead References[edit] ^ Stadiums in South Africa Archived 2019-07-21 at the Wayback Machine.
