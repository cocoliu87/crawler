These pages are accessed via the interlanguage (interwiki) links, usually visible on the bottom left of a page. (Top right on mobile.) Links to all the different language versions for that page will be displayed. A lack of interlanguage links indicates that there is no equivalent page in any other language. Other language versions are usually written independently rather than being a translation. The interlanguage links may on occasion lead to non-existent pages.
