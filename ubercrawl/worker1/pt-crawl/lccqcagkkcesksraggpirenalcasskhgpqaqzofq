By 25 April 2023, fighting intensified and devolved along tribal lines, with Masalit and non-Arab peoples supporting the SAF and the aligned Joint Darfur Force—consisting of former rebel groups including the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army and the Justice and Equality Movement—against the RSF and allied Arab militias. Thousands of civilians and soldiers were killed after the fighting broke out, and humanitarian organizations have equated indiscriminate civilian killings throughout the battle to the Rwandan genocide. The Rapid Support Forces captured the city on 22 June, and reports emerged of ethnic cleansing of non-Arab civilians in the city. Over 1,000 bodies have been discovered in dozens of mass graves since August 2023, primarily of Masalit and Burgo civilians.[14] On 4 November 2023, the Rapid Support Forces reportedly captured a Sudanese Army headquarters in Geneina.[15] Background[edit] Main articles: Darfur campaign and War in Darfur War in Darfur[edit] In 2003, war broke out in western Sudan's Darfur region between the government-sponsored, predominantly Arab Janjaweed militia aided by the Sudanese Armed Forces against the predominantly non-Arab Sudan Liberation Movement and Justice and Equality Movement, after SLM and JEM launched attacks against the Sudanese government and accusing them of genocide. On 25 March 2003, the rebels seized the garrison town of Tine along the Chadian border, seizing large quantities of supplies and arms. Despite a threat by President Omar al-Bashir to "unleash" the army, the military had little in reserve. The army was already deployed in both the south, where the Second Sudanese Civil War was drawing to an end, and the east, where rebels sponsored by Eritrea were threatening a newly constructed pipeline from the central oilfields to Port Sudan. El Geneina, as the capital of West Darfur, saw an extensive amount of violence, due to its location as the sultanate of the Masalit people.[16] The city had a population of 250,000 in 2008.[17] In 2020, the war came to an end after several rebel groups signed a peace treaty with the Sudanese government following the Sudanese Revolution and the ousting of Omar al-Bashir. In the process, the Janjaweed restructured itself into the Rapid Support Forces, although many Darfuris still call it the Janjaweed.[18] Pre-War attacks on Geneina[edit] During the summer of 2020, Geneina and its surroundings were attacked killing civilians and injuring several. This affected the entire region causing a displacement crisis within Darfur. [19][20] In April 2022, fighting in West Darfur resumed, killing about 300 people mainly in Geneina. [21] War in Sudan (2023)[edit] Main article: War in Sudan (2023) Geneina was considered strategic due to its location in Darfur, the city pre-war housed around 540,000 civilians. [b][22] The city also had the largest Masalit population in the entire region, making it a target for the RSF who were aligned with Arab tribesmen. Geneina was also a hub for the Sudanese Armed Forces, who used the Geneina Airport and bases around the city, it remained a large location for West Darfur and Chadian civilians who had almost no access to food or education due to the deserted regions. [23] In early 2023, tensions rose between the Sudanese Armed Forces, led by the 2021 coup leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces led by Hemedti, remnants of Omar al-Bashir's Janjaweed that committed ethnic cleansing against non-Arab tribes in Darfur. These tensions came to a head on 15 April, when RSF forces attacked Sudanese forces in Khartoum, Merowe, and several cities across Darfur, including Nyala, El Fasher, and Geneina.[24][25] In Geneina, West Darfur governor Khamis Abakar declared a state of emergency on 10 April due to the killing of three people by the Sudanese Alliance, a militia led by the governor.[26] Clashes between Arabs and non-Arabs also broke out in Foro-Baranga, on the border with Chad, on 13 April, leaving 24 people dead.[27] After the battle, investigations, and interviews with civilians who survived the battle were carried out. Mass graves are still being found with thousands possibly dead due to the massacre. [28] Battle[edit] Initial clashes (15–17 April 2023)[edit] The battle in Geneina broke out on 15 April 2023, and took place in the western part of Geneina.[29] The initial clashes lasted for an hour and a half, according to a Masalit tribal leader, and ended at noon.[30] Civilians began sheltering in their homes, and the Masalit leader stated the situation in the city was "turbulent and unstable".[30] Clashes continued into the next day, but little is known about them.[31] The Rapid Support Forces claimed late in the night of 16 April that they had captured the Geneina Airport, but this was impossible to verify at the time.[32] A nationwide ceasefire, originating in Khartoum, also failed to hold up in Geneina on 16 April.[30] By 17 April, the El-Geneina hospital had closed due to the fighting.[33] At the time, the death toll and exact location of fighting in Geneina were impossible to verify, due to fog of war, and the fogginess of the sides.[34] While some sources stated fighting broke out between the SAF and RSF, others claimed clashes were actually between Arabs and the non-Arab Masalit.[35] Ahmed Gouja, a journalist in Nyala, corroborated the claims of the Arab-Masalit clashes, and that civilians had stolen weapons from the police station to protect themselves and their neighborhoods.[36] OCHA reported that UN offices were being looted in the city, and markets, homes, and offices of other humanitarian organizations were being torched.[35] On 23 April, Sudanese Armed forces attempted to recapture parts of the city from the RSF, but were pushed back into the army headquarters.[37] Clashes intensify and tribal alliances form (24 April–2 May 2023)[edit] On 25 April, clashes intensified starting in the al-Jamarik neighborhood.[30] In the al-Jabal neighborhood, where Arab militiamen attacked the headquarters of the joint Sudanese-Chadian forces and stole about eleven armored vehicles. Arab militiamen also attacked municipal and state organizations, including the town's police headquarters, market, and bank.[38] The fighting on 25 April began when Sudanese Alliance fighters attacked RSF bases in El Geneina.[38] Volker Perthes, the UN representative to Sudan, released a statement that day claiming that tribal leaders in El-Geneina began mobilization campaigns.[38] Perthes also stated militias from Central Darfur and North Darfur were joining fighting in El-Geneina. The Darfur Bar Association stated that 25 people were killed on 25 April alone, and thousands of refugees had fled to Chad.[39] The UN Human Rights organization claimed over 96 people were killed.[40] The Deputy Police Director of West Darfur, Brig. Gen. Abdel-Baqi al-Hassan Mohamed, was killed in the fighting as well.[41] Residents of El-Geneina claimed they saw "pick-up trucks full of dead people".[41] One resident, speaking to the BBC, claimed RSF soldiers burnt down all refugee camps in and around the city, and that fighters were attacking houses with rockets.[41][42] Community leaders in the city also stated that gunmen attacked displaced refugees in the center of the city, including the Abuzar refugee camp.[43] Médecins Sans Frontières released a statement claiming that the El Geneina Teaching Hospital was looted by militants on 28 April, and the organization deplored the looting.[44] Many hospitals have closed due to being looted, while ambulances and paramedic contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 51 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Battle_of_Geneina responseCode 3 200
