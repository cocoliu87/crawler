Except after certain holidays, it is published daily. Its name derives from that of the Finnish capital, Helsinki, where it is published. It is considered a newspaper of record for Finland. History and profile[edit] The front page of the Helsingin Sanomat for July 7, 1904 The paper was founded in 1889[2] as Päivälehti, when Finland was a Grand Duchy under the Tsar of Russia.[3] Political censorship by the Russian authorities, prompted by the paper's strong advocacy of greater Finnish freedoms and even outright independence, forced Päivälehti to often temporarily suspend publication, and finally to close permanently in 1904.[4] Its proprietors re-opened the paper under its current name in 1905.[5] Founded as the organ of the Young Finnish Party, the paper has been politically independent and non-aligned since 1932.[2][6] During the Cold War period Helsingin Sanomat was among the Finnish newspapers which were accused by the Soviet Union of being the instrument of US propaganda, and the Soviet Embassy in Helsinki frequently protested the editors of the paper.[7] Helsingin Sanomat has a long history as a family business, owned by the Erkko family.[8] It is currently owned by the Sanoma media group which also owns Ilta-Sanomat.[9] The relationship between the owners of Helsingin Sanomat and Finland's government have sometimes been close. For instance, during the run-up to the Winter War, Eljas Erkko was at the same time the paper's publisher and Finland's foreign minister. Helsingin Sanomat strongly advocated Finland joining the European Union in the run-up to the decision to do so in 1994. It has also openly expressed support for Finland's membership of NATO.[10] In fact, it supports the participation of Finland in all Western institutions.[10] Mikael Pentikäinen was the editor-in-chief until May 2013 when he was fired from the post.[11][12] Riikka Venäläinen replaced him temporarily in the post.[11] After Riikka Venäläinen the post has been held by Kaius Niemi.[13] After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the newspaper established a Russian-language news website to cover the war. In May 2022, Russian authorities blocked access to the website of the newspaper.[14] On April 5, 2023, editor-in-chief Kaius Niemi was arrested for driving under the influence. He was fined in court and resigned from his post. Erja Yläjärvi became the new editor-in-chief in August.[15] Format[edit] Helsingin Sanomat is published daily in Finnish in compact format with the exception of the days after public holidays when the paper does not appear. Subscriptions make up 97% of the newspaper's circulation.[16] The front page is usually devoted to advertisements. The newspaper was published in broadsheet format until 6 January 2013.[17] The paper also has a monthly supplement named Kuukausiliite (Finnish for Monthly Supplement), and a weekly TV guide and entertainment-oriented supplement named Nyt (meaning Now in English). Between 1999 and 2012 there were also both Finnish and English-language online newspaper editions.[18] Content of Helsingin Sanomat can be accessed also through mobile devices.
