Donetskaya Narodnaya Respublika, IPA: [dɐˈnʲetskəjə nɐˈrodnəjə rʲɪˈspublʲɪkə]; abbreviated as DPR or DNR, Russian: ДНР) is an internationally unrecognised republic of Russia in the occupied region of eastern Ukraine's Donetsk Oblast, with its capital in Donetsk.[5][6][failed verification] The DPR was created by Russian-backed paramilitaries in 2014,[7][8] and it initially operated as a breakaway state until it was annexed by Russia in 2022. Following Ukraine's Revolution of Dignity in 2014, pro-Russian, counter-revolutionary unrest erupted in the eastern part of the country. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine, while armed separatists seized government buildings and proclaimed the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) as independent states. This sparked the war in Donbas, part of the wider Russo-Ukrainian War. The DPR and LPR are sometimes described as puppet states of Russia during this conflict.[9][10][11] They received no international recognition from United Nations member states before 2022. On 21 February 2022, Russia recognised the DPR and LPR as sovereign states. Three days later, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, partially under the pretext of protecting the republics. Russian forces captured more of Donetsk Oblast, which became part of the DPR. In September 2022, Russia proclaimed the annexation of the DPR and other occupied territories, following referendums widely described as fraudulent by commentators. The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution calling on countries not to recognise what it called the "attempted illegal annexation" and demanded that Russia "immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw".[12][13] The Head of the Donetsk People's Republic is Denis Pushilin, and its parliament is the People's Council. According to a report by the French Institute of International Relations (IFRI), the ideology of the DPR is shaped by elements of right-wing Russian nationalism, Russian imperialism and Orthodox fundamentalism.[14] Russian far-right groups played an important role among the separatists, especially at the beginning of the conflict.[15] Organizations such as the UN Human Rights Office and Human Rights Watch have reported human rights abuses in the DPR, including internment, torture, extrajudicial killings, and forced conscription,[16] as well as political and media repression. The DPR People's Militia has also been held responsible for war crimes, among them the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17.[17] Ukraine views the DPR and LPR as terrorist organisations.[18] History[edit] See also: Donetsk Republic (political party), 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine, and 2014 Euromaidan regional state administration occupations Ukrainian riot police guarding the entrance to the RSA building on 7 March 2014 Ukrainian military roadblocks in Donetsk oblast on 8 May 2014 The Luhansk and Donetsk Peoples Republics are located in the historical Donbas region of Eastern Ukraine. Since Ukraine's independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Eastern and Western Ukraine typically have voted for different candidates in presidential elections. Viktor Yanukovych, a Donetsk native, was elected as President of Ukraine in 2010. Eastern Ukrainian dissatisfaction with the government can also be attributed to the Euromaidan Protests which began in November 2013,[19] as well as Russian support[20] due to tension in Russia–Ukraine relations over Ukraine's geopolitical orientation.[21] President Yanukovych's overthrow in the 2014 Ukrainian revolution led to protests in Eastern Ukraine, which gradually escalated into an armed conflict between the newly formed Ukrainian government and the local armed militias.[22] The pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine was originally characterised by riots and protests which had eventually escalated into the storming of government offices.[23] Formation (2014–2015)[edit] See also: Russo-Ukrainian War and War in Donbas (2014–2022) Foundations[edit] See also: Capture of Donetsk (2014) Pro-Russian separatists occupying the Donetsk RSA building on 7 April 2014 Sloviansk city council under the control of heavily armed men on 14 April 2014 On 6 April, 2014, pro-Russian rebel leaders announced that a referendum on whether Donetsk Oblast should "join the Russian Federation", would take place "no later than May 11th, 2014."[24] Additionally, the group's leaders appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin to send Russian peacekeeping forces to the region.[24][25] On 7 April, between 1,000 and 2,000[26] people attended a rally in Donetsk pushing for a Crimea-style referendum on independence from Ukraine. Ukrainian media claimed that the proposed referendum had no status quo option.[27] Afterwards, 200–1,000 separatists[28][26] stormed and took control of the first two floors of the government headquarters of the Regional State Administration (RSA), breaking down doors and smashing windows. The separatists demanded a referendum to join Russia, and said they would otherwise take unilateral control and dismiss the elected government.[29][30][31] When the session was not held, the unelected separatists held a vote within the RSA building and overwhelmingly backed the declaration of a Donetsk People's Republic.[32] According to the Russian ITAR-TASS, the declaration was voted by some regional legislators, while Ukrainian media claimed that neither the Donetsk city council nor district councils of the city delegated any representatives to the session.[33][34] The political leadership initially consisted of Denis Pushilin, self-appointed as chairman of the government,[35][36] while Igor Kakidzyanov was named as the commander of the People's Army.[37] Vyacheslav Ponomarev became the self-proclaimed mayor of the city of Sloviansk.[38] Ukrainian-born pro-Russian activist Pavel Gubarev,[39][40] an Anti-Maidan activist, a former member of the neo-Nazi Russian National Unity paramilitary group in 1999–2001 and former member of the nazbol Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine, proclaimed himself the People's Governor of the Donetsk Region.[41][42][43][44] He was arrested on charges of separatism and illegal seizure of power but released in a hostage swap.[45][39] Alexander Borodai, a Russian citizen claiming to be involved in the Russian annexation of Crimea, was appointed as Prime Minister, while Igor Girkin was made Defence Minister. Borodai had a past working for an openly anti-semitic and fascist Russian newspaper Zavtra which had called for pogroms against Jews.[46][47] On the morning of 8 April, the 'Patriotic Forces of Donbas', a pro-Kyiv group that was formed on 15 March earlier that year by 13 pro-Kyiv NGOs, political parties and individuals,[48][49] issued a statement "cancelling" the other group's declaration of independence, citing complaints from locals.[50][51][52] The Donetsk Republic organisation continued to occupy the RSA and upheld all previous calls for a referendum and the release of their leader Pavel Gubarev.[53][b] On 8 April, about a thousand people rallied in front of the RSA listening to speeches about the Donetsk People's Republic and to Soviet and Russian music.[54] Ukrainian media stated that a number of Russian citizens, including one leader of a far-right militant group, had also taken part in the events.[55] 12 April saw the start of a military conflict. Russian nationalist and former intelligence officer Igor "Strelkov" Girkin led an armed team of 52 volunteers and mercenaries from Crimea, where he had participated in the Russian occupation of the peninsula, to seize police and government buildings in Sloviansk, Donetsk Oblast.[56]: 14–17  Girkin's unit drove off an initial response by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and successive assaults by government, in what was to become an eighty-four day siege.[56]: 14–17  Girkin later said that he had been "the one who pulled the trigger of war".[57] On 15 April 2014, acting Ukrainian President Olexander Turchynov announced the start of a military counteroffensive to confront the pro-Russian militants, and on 17 April, tensions de-escalated as Russia, the US, and the EU agreed on a roadmap to eventually end the crisis.[58][59] However, officials of the People's Republic ignored the agreement and vowed to continue their occupations until a referendum was accepted or the government in Kyiv resigned.[60] The OSCE reported that all the main institutions of the city observed by the Monitoring Mission seemed to be working normally as of 16 April.[61] On 22 April, separatists agreed to release the session hall of the building along with two floors to state officials.[62] The ninth and tenth floors were later released on 24 April.[63] On the second day of the Republic, organisers decided to pour all of their alcohol out and announce a prohibition law after issues arose due to excessive drinking in the building.[64] On 7 May, Russian president Vladimir Putin asked the separatists to postpone the proposed referendum to create the necessary conditions for dialogue. Despite Putin's comments, the Donetsk Republic group said they would still carry out the referendum.[65] contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 61 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Donetsk_People%27s_Republic responseCode 3 200
