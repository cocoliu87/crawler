Since the mid-1990s, the FSF's employees and volunteers have mostly worked on legal and structural issues for the free software movement and the free software community. Consistent with its goals, the FSF aims to use only free software on its own computers.[11] History[edit] This article may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia's quality standards.

(May 2014) (template removal help) The Free Software Foundation was founded in 1985 as a non-profit corporation supporting free software development. It continued existing GNU projects such as the sale of manuals and tapes, and employed developers of the free software system.[12] Since then, it has continued these activities, as well as advocating for the free software movement. The FSF is also the steward of several free software licenses, meaning it publishes them and has the ability to make revisions as needed.[13] The FSF holds the copyrights on many pieces of the GNU system, such as GNU Compiler Collection. As holder of these copyrights, it has the authority to enforce the copyleft requirements of the GNU General Public License (GPL) when copyright infringement occurs on that software. From 1991 until 2001, GPL enforcement was done informally, usually by Stallman himself, often with assistance from FSF's lawyer, Eben Moglen.[citation needed] Typically, GPL violations during this time were cleared up by short email exchanges between Stallman and the violator.[citation needed] In the interest of promoting copyleft assertiveness by software companies to the level that the FSF was already doing, in 2004 Harald Welte launched gpl-violations.org. In late 2001, Bradley M. Kuhn (then executive director), with the assistance of Moglen, David Turner, and Peter T. Brown, formalized these efforts into FSF's GPL Compliance Labs. From 2002–2004, high-profile GPL enforcement cases, such as those against Linksys and OpenTV, became frequent.[14][15][16] GPL enforcement and educational campaigns on GPL compliance was a major focus of the FSF's efforts during this period.[17][18] In March 2003, SCO filed suit against IBM alleging that IBM's contributions to various free software, including FSF's GNU, violated SCO's rights. While FSF was never a party to the lawsuit, FSF was subpoenaed on November 5, 2003.[19] During 2003 and 2004, FSF put substantial advocacy effort into responding to the lawsuit and quelling its negative impact on the adoption and promotion of free software.[20][21] From 2003 to 2005, FSF held legal seminars to explain the GPL and the surrounding law.[22] Usually taught by Bradley M. Kuhn and Daniel Ravicher, these seminars offered CLE credit and were the first effort to give formal legal education on the GPL.[21][23][24] In 2007, the FSF published the third version of the GNU General Public License after significant outside input.[25][26] In December 2008, FSF filed a lawsuit against Cisco for using GPL-licensed components shipped with Linksys products. Cisco was notified of the licensing issue in 2003 but Cisco repeatedly disregarded its obligations under the GPL.[27] In May 2009, Cisco and FSF reached settlement under which Cisco agreed to make a monetary donation to the FSF and appoint a Free Software Director to conduct continuous reviews of the company's license compliance practices.[28] In September 2019, Richard Stallman resigned as president of the FSF after pressure from journalists and members of the open source community in response to him making controversial comments in defense of Marvin Minsky on Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking scandal.[29] Nevertheless, Stallman remained head of the GNU Project and in 2021, he returned to the FSF board of directors.[30][31][32][33] Current and ongoing activities[edit] The GNU Project[edit] Main article: GNU Project The original purpose of the FSF was to promote the ideals of free software. The organization developed the GNU operating system as an example of this. GNU licenses[edit] The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a widely used license for free software projects. The current version (version 3) was released in June 2007. The FSF has also published the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), and the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL). GNU Press[edit] The FSF's publishing department, responsible for "publishing affordable books on computer science using freely distributable licenses."[34][35] The Free Software Directory[edit] Main article: Free Software Directory This is a list of software packages that have been verified as free software. Each package entry contains up to 47 pieces of information such as the project's homepage, developers, programming language, etc. The goals are to provide a search engine for free software, and to provide a cross-reference for users to check if a package has been verified as being free software. FSF has received a small amount of funding from UNESCO for this project. Maintaining the Free Software Definition[edit] Main article: The Free Software Definition FSF maintains many of the documents that define the free software movement. Project hosting[edit] FSF hosts software development projects on its Savannah website. h-node[edit] An abbreviation for "Hardware-Node", the h-node website lists hardware and device drivers that have been verified as compatible with free software. It is user-edited and volunteer supported with hardware entries tested by users before publication.[36][37][38] Advocacy[edit] FSF sponsors a number of campaigns against what it perceives as dangers to software freedom, including software patents, digital rights management (which the FSF and others[39] have re-termed "digital restrictions management", as part of its effort to highlight technologies that are "designed to take away and limit your rights",[40]) and user interface copyright. Since 2012, Defective by Design is an FSF-initiated campaign against DRM.[41] It also has a campaign to promote Ogg+Vorbis, a free alternative to proprietary formats like AAC and MQA. FSF also sponsors free software projects it deems "high-priority". Annual awards[edit] See also: FSF Free Software Awards "Outstanding new Free Software contributor", "Award for the Advancement of Free Software" and "Free Software Award for Projects of Social Benefit" LibrePlanet wiki[edit] The LibrePlanet wiki organizes FSF members into regional groups in order to promote free software activism against Digital Restrictions Management and other issues promoted by the FSF. High priority projects[edit] Parabola GNU/Linux-libre is a distribution officially endorsed by the FSF. The FSF maintains a list of "high priority projects" to which the Foundation claims that "there is a vital need to draw the free software community's attention".[42] The FSF considers these projects "important because computer users are continually being seduced into using non-free software, because there is no adequate free replacement."[42] As of 2021, high priority tasks include reverse engineering proprietary firmware; reversible debugging in GNU Debugger; developing automatic transcription and video editing software, Coreboot, drivers for network routers, a free smartphone operating system and creating replacements for Skype and Siri.[42] Previous projects highlighted as needing work included the Free Java implementations, GNU Classpath, and GNU Compiler for Java, which ensure compatibility for the Java part of OpenOffice.org, and the GNOME desktop environment (see Java: Licensing).[43] The effort has been criticized by Michael Larabel for either not instigating active development or for being slow at the work being done, even after certain projects were added to the list.[44][45] Endorsements[edit] Operating systems[edit] The FSF maintains a list of approved Linux operating systems that maintain free software by default:[46] Dragora GNU/Linux-Libre dyne:bolic GNU Guix System Hyperbola GNU/Linux-libre Parabola GNU/Linux-libre PureOS Trisquel Ututo LibreCMC ProteanOS The project also maintains a list of operating systems that are not versions of the GNU system: Replicant Discontinued operating systems[edit] The following are previously endorsed operating systems that are no longer actively maintained: gNewSense BLAG Linux and GNU Musix GNU+Linux Hardware endorsements (RYF)[edit] See also: Libreboot and Coreboot Since 2012, the FSF maintains a "Respects Your Freedom" (RYF) hardware certification program.
