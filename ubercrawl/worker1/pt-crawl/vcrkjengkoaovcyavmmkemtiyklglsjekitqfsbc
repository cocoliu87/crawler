Skolt Sámi (sääʹmǩiõll [ɕa̟ːmʰc͡çjɘhlː], "the Sámi language", or nuõrttsääʹmǩiõll [nwɘrʰtːɕa̟ːmʰc͡çjɘhlː], "the Eastern Sámi language", if a distinction needs to be made between it and the other Sámi languages) is a Uralic, Sámi language that is spoken by the Skolts, with approximately 300[2] speakers in Finland, mainly in Sevettijärvi and approximately 20–30 speakers of the Njuõʹttjäuʹrr (Notozero) dialect[3] in an area surrounding Lake Lovozero in Russia. In Norway, there are fewer than 15 that can speak Skolt Sámi (as of 2023);[4] furthermore, the language is[4] largely spoken in the Neiden area.[3] It is written using a modified Roman orthography which was made official in 1973. The term Skolt was coined by representatives of the majority culture and has negative connotation which can be compared to the term Lapp. Nevertheless, it is used in cultural and linguistic studies.[5] Sámi dialects and settlements in Russia: Skolt (Russian Notozersky) History[edit] Road sign for the Äʹvv Skolt Sámi Museum [no] in Neiden, Norway. Starting at the top, the lines are in Norwegian, Skolt Sámi, and Finnish. On Finnish territory Skolt Sámi was spoken in four villages before the Second World War. In Petsamo, Skolt Sámi was spoken in Suonikylä and the village of Petsamo. This area was ceded to Russia in the Second World War, and the Skolts were evacuated to the villages of Inari, Sevettijärvi and Nellim in the Inari municipality. On the Russian (then Soviet) side the dialect was spoken in the now defunct Sámi settlements of Motovsky, Songelsky, Notozero (hence its Russian name – the Notozersky dialect). Some speakers still may live in the villages of Tuloma and Lovozero. On Norwegian territory Skolt Sámi was spoken in the Sør-Varanger area with a cultural centre in Neiden. The language is not spoken as mother tongue any more in Norway. Status[edit] A quadrilingual street sign in Inari in (from top to bottom) Finnish, Northern Saami, Inari Saami, and Skolt Saami. Inari is the only municipality in Finland with 4 official languages. The village workshop in Sevettijärvi Finland[edit] In Finland, Skolt Sámi is spoken by approximately 400 people. According to Finland's Sámi Language Act (1086/2003), Skolt Sámi is one of the three Sámi languages that the Sámi can use when conducting official business in Lapland. It is an official language in the municipality of Inari, and elementary schools there offer courses in the language, both for native speakers and for students learning it as a foreign language. Only a small number of youths learn the language and continue to use it actively.[citation needed] Skolt Sámi is thus a seriously endangered language, even more seriously than Inari Sámi, which has a nearly equal number of speakers and is even spoken in the same municipality. In addition, there are a lot of Skolts living outside of this area, particularly in the capital region. Use[edit] Media[edit] From 1978 to 1986, the Skolts had a quarterly called Sääʹmođđâz published in their own language.[6] Since 2013, a new magazine called Tuõddri peeʹrel has been published once a year.[7] The Finnish news program Yle Ođđasat featured a Skolt Sámi speaking newsreader for the first time on August 26, 2016. Otherwise Yle Ođđasat presents individual news stories in Skolt Sámi every now and then.[8] In addition, there have been various TV programs in Skolt Sámi on YLE such as the children's TV series Binnabánnaš. Religion[edit] The first book published in Skolt Sámi was an Eastern Orthodox prayer book (Risttoummi moʹlidvaǩeʹrjj, Prayerbook for the Orthodox) in 1983. Translation of the Gospel of John was published (Evvan evaŋǧeʹlium) in 1988 and Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom (Pââʹss Eʹččen Evvan Krysostomoozz Liturgia, Liturgy of our Holy Father John Chrysostom) was published in 2002 [9] Skolt Sámi is used together with Finnish in worship of the Lappi Orthodox Parish (Lappi ortodookslaž sieʹbrrkåʹdd) at churches of Ivalo, Sevettijärvi and Nellim.[10] Music[edit] Like Inari Sámi, Skolt Sámi has recently borne witness to a new phenomenon, namely it is being used in rock songs sung by Tiina Sanila-Aikio, who has published two full-length CDs in Skolt Sámi to date. Education[edit] In 1993, language nest programs for children younger than 7 were created. For quite some time these programs received intermittent funding, resulting in some children being taught Skolt Sámi, while others were not. In spite of all the issues these programs faced, they were crucial in creating the youngest generations of Skolt Sámi speakers. In recent years, these programs have been reinstated. In addition, 2005 was the first time that it was possible to use Skolt Sámi in a Finnish matriculation exam, albeit as a foreign language. In 2012, Ville-Riiko Fofonoff (Skolt Sami: Läärvan-Oʹlssi-Peâtt-Rijggu-Vääʹsǩ-Rijggu-Ville-Reeiǥaž) was the first person to use Skolt Sámi for the mother tongue portion of the exam; for this, he won the Skolt of the Year Award the same year.[11] Writing system[edit] In 1973, an official, standardized orthography for Skolt Sámi was introduced based on the Suõʹnnʼjel dialect. Since then, it has been widely accepted with a few small modifications.[12] The Skolt Sámi orthography uses the ISO basic Latin alphabet with the addition of a few special characters: Letter Phoneme(s) Letter Phoneme(s) Letter Phoneme(s) A a /ɑ/ Ǧ ǧ /ɟ͡ʝ/ Õ õ /ɘ/ Â â /ɐ/ Ǥ ǥ /ɣ/ P p /p/ B b /b/ H h /x/ R r /r/ C c /t͡s/ I i /i/, /j/ S s /s/ Č č /t͡ʃ/ J j /ʝ/ Š š /ʃ/ Ʒ ʒ /d͡z/ K k /k/ T t /t/ Ǯ ǯ /d͡ʒ/ Ǩ ǩ /c͡ç/ U u /u/, /w/ D d /d/ L l /l/ V v /v/ Đ đ /ð/ M m /m/ Z z /z/ E e /e/, /ɛ/ N n /n/ Ž ž /ʒ/ F f /f/ Ŋ ŋ /ŋ/ Å å /ɔ/ G g /ɡ/ O o /o/ Ä ä /a/ Notes: The letters Q/q, W/w, X/x, Y/y and Ö/ö are also used, although only in foreign words or loans. As in Finnish and Swedish Ü/ü is alphabetized as y, not u. No difference is made in the standard orthography between /e/ and /ɛ/. In dictionaries, grammars and other reference works, the letter ⟨ẹ⟩ is used to indicate /ɛ/. The diagraphs ⟨lj⟩ and ⟨nj⟩ indicate the consonants /ʎ/ and /ɲ/ respectively. Additional marks are used in writing Skolt Sámi words: A prime symbol ʹ (U+02B9 MODIFIER LETTER PRIME) is added after the vowel of a syllable to indicate suprasegmental palatalization. Occasionally a standalone acute accent ´ or ˊ (U+00B4 ACUTE ACCENT or U+02CA MODIFIER LETTER ACUTE ACCENT) is used, but this is not correct. An apostrophe ʼ (U+02BC MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE) is used in the combinations ⟨lʼj⟩ and ⟨nʼj⟩ to indicate that these are two separate sounds, not a single sound. It is also placed between identical consonants to indicate that they belong to separate prosodic feet, and should not be combined into a geminate. It distinguishes e.g. lueʹštted "to set free" from its causative lueʹštʼted "to cause to set free". A hyphen – is used in compound words when there are two identical consonants at the juncture between the parts of the compound, e.g. ǩiõtt-tel "mobile phone". A vertical line ˈ (U+02C8 MODIFIER LETTER VERTICAL LINE), typewriter apostrophe or other similar mark indicates that a geminate consonant is long, and the preceding diphthong is short. It is placed between a pair of identical consonants which are always preceded by a diphthong. This mark is not used in normal Skolt Sámi writing, but it appears in dictionaries, grammars and other reference works. Phonology[edit] Special features of this Sámi language include a highly complex vowel system and a suprasegmental contrast of palatalized vs. non-palatalized stress groups; palatalized stress groups are indicated by a "softener mark", represented by the modifier letter prime (ʹ). Vowels[edit] The system of vowel phonemes is as follows: front central back close i u close-mid e ɘ o open-mid ɛ ɐ ɔ open a ɑ Skolt Sámi has vowel length, but it co-occurs with contrasts in length of the following consonant(s). Before a long consonant, vowels are short, while before a short consonant vowels are long (written with a doubled letter). For example, leʹtt ‘vessel’ vs. leeʹtt ‘vessels’. The vowels can combine to form twelve opening diphthongs: front front to central back to front back to central back close to close-mid ie iɘ ue uɘ close to open-mid iɛ iɐ uɛ uɐ uɔ close to open ua close-mid to open-mid eɐ close-mid to open ea Like the monophthongs, all diphthongs can be short or long, but this is not indicated in spelling. Short diphthongs are distinguished from long ones by both length and stress placement: short diphthongs have a stressed second component, whereas long diphthongs have s contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 49 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Skolt_S%C3%A1mi responseCode 3 200
