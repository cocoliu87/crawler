NBG introduces the notion of class, which is a collection of sets defined by a formula whose quantifiers range only over sets. NBG can define classes that are larger than sets, such as the class of all sets and the class of all ordinals. Morse–Kelley set theory (MK) allows classes to be defined by formulas whose quantifiers range over classes. NBG is finitely axiomatizable, while ZFC and MK are not. A key theorem of NBG is the class existence theorem, which states that for every formula whose quantifiers range only over sets, there is a class consisting of the sets satisfying the formula. This class is built by mirroring the step-by-step construction of the formula with classes. Since all set-theoretic formulas are constructed from two kinds of atomic formulas (membership and equality) and finitely many logical symbols, only finitely many axioms are needed to build the classes satisfying them. This is why NBG is finitely axiomatizable. Classes are also used for other constructions, for handling the set-theoretic paradoxes, and for stating the axiom of global choice, which is stronger than ZFC's axiom of choice. John von Neumann introduced classes into set theory in 1925. The primitive notions of his theory were function and argument. Using these notions, he defined class and set.[1] Paul Bernays reformulated von Neumann's theory by taking class and set as primitive notions.[2] Kurt Gödel simplified Bernays' theory for his relative consistency proof of the axiom of choice and the generalized continuum hypothesis.[3] Classes in set theory[edit] The uses of classes[edit] Classes have several uses in NBG: They produce a finite axiomatization of set theory.[4] They are used to state a "very strong form of the axiom of choice"[5]—namely, the axiom of global choice: There exists a global choice function G {\displaystyle G} defined on the class of all nonempty sets such that G ( x ) ∈ x {\displaystyle G(x)\in x} for every nonempty set x . {\displaystyle x.} This is stronger than ZFC's axiom of choice: For every set s {\displaystyle s} of nonempty sets, there exists a choice function f {\displaystyle f} defined on s {\displaystyle s} such that f ( x ) ∈ x {\displaystyle f(x)\in x} for all x ∈ s . {\displaystyle x\in s.} [a] The set-theoretic paradoxes are handled by recognizing that some classes cannot be sets. For example, assume that the class O r d {\displaystyle Ord} of all ordinals is a set. Then O r d {\displaystyle Ord} is a transitive set well-ordered by ∈ {\displaystyle \in } . So, by definition, O r d {\displaystyle Ord} is an ordinal. Hence, O r d ∈ O r d {\displaystyle Ord\in Ord} , which contradicts ∈ {\displaystyle \in } being a well-ordering of O r d . {\displaystyle Ord.} Therefore, O r d {\displaystyle Ord} is not a set. A class that is not a set is called a proper class, O r d {\displaystyle Ord} is a proper class.[6] Proper classes are useful in constructions. In his proof of the relative consistency of the axiom of global choice and the generalized continuum hypothesis, Gödel used proper classes to build the constructible universe. He constructed a function on the class of all ordinals that, for each ordinal, builds a constructible set by applying a set-building operation to previously constructed sets. The constructible universe is the image of this function.[7] Axiom schema versus class existence theorem[edit] Once classes are added to the language of ZFC, it is easy to transform ZFC into a set theory with classes. First, the axiom schema of class comprehension is added. This axiom schema states: For every formula ϕ ( x 1 , … , x n ) {\displaystyle \phi (x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})} that quantifies only over sets, there exists a class A {\displaystyle A} consisting of the n {\displaystyle n} -tuples satisfying the formula—that is, ∀ x 1 ⋯ ∀ x n [ ( x 1 , … , x n ) ∈ A ⟺ ϕ ( x 1 , … , x n ) ] . {\displaystyle \forall x_{1}\cdots \,\forall x_{n}[(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})\in A\iff \phi (x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})].} Then the axiom schema of replacement is replaced by a single axiom that uses a class. Finally, ZFC's axiom of extensionality is modified to handle classes: If two classes have the same elements, then they are identical. The other axioms of ZFC are not modified.[8] This theory is not finitely axiomatized. ZFC's replacement schema has been replaced by a single axiom, but the axiom schema of class comprehension has been introduced. To produce a theory with finitely many axioms, the axiom schema of class comprehension is first replaced with finitely many class existence axioms. Then these axioms are used to prove the class existence theorem, which implies every instance of the axiom schema.[8] The proof of this theorem requires only seven class existence axioms, which are used to convert the construction of a formula into the construction of a class satisfying the formula. Axiomatization of NBG[edit] Classes and sets[edit] NBG has two types of objects: classes and sets. Intuitively, every set is also a class. There are two ways to axiomatize this. Bernays used many-sorted logic with two sorts: classes and sets.[2] Gödel avoided sorts by introducing primitive predicates: C l s ( A ) {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {Cls}}(A)} for " A {\displaystyle A} is a class" and M ( A ) {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {M}}(A)} for " A {\displaystyle A} is a set" (in German, "set" is Menge). He also introduced axioms stating that every set is a class and that if class A {\displaystyle A} is a member of a class, then A {\displaystyle A} is a set.[9] Using predicates is the standard way to eliminate sorts. Elliott Mendelson modified Gödel's approach by having everything be a class and defining the set predicate M ( A ) {\displaystyle M(A)} as ∃ C ( A ∈ C ) . {\displaystyle \exists C(A\in C).} [10] This modification eliminates Gödel's class predicate and his two axioms. Bernays' two-sorted approach may appear more natural at first, but it creates a more complex theory.[b] In Bernays' theory, every set has two representations: one as a set and the other as a class. Also, there are two membership relations: the first, denoted by "∈", is between two sets; the second, denoted by "η", is between a set and a class.[2] This redundancy is required by many-sorted logic because variables of different sorts range over disjoint subdomains of the domain of discourse. The differences between these two approaches do not affect what can be proved, but they do affect how statements are written. In Gödel's approach, A ∈ C {\displaystyle A\in C} where A {\displaystyle A} and C {\displaystyle C} are classes is a valid statement. In Bernays' approach this statement has no meaning. However, if A {\displaystyle A} is a set, there is an equivalent statement: Define "set a {\displaystyle a} represents class A {\displaystyle A} " if they have the same sets as members—that is, ∀ x ( x ∈ a ⟺ x η A ) . {\displaystyle \forall x(x\in a\iff x\;\eta \;A).} The statement a η C {\displaystyle a\;\eta \;C} where set a {\displaystyle a} represents class A {\displaystyle A} is equivalent to Gödel's A ∈ C . {\displaystyle A\in C.} [2] The approach adopted in this article is that of Gödel with Mendelson's modification. This means that NBG is an axiomatic system in first-order predicate logic with equality, and its only primitive notions are class and the membership relation. Definitions and axioms of extensionality and pairing[edit] A set is a class that belongs to at least one class: A {\displaystyle A} is a set if and only if ∃ C ( A ∈ C ) {\displaystyle \exists C(A\in C)} . A class that is not a set is called a proper class: A {\displaystyle A} is a proper class if and only if ∀ C ( A ∉ C ) {\displaystyle \forall C(A\notin C)} .[12] Therefore, every class is either a set or a proper class, and no class is both. Gödel introduced the convention that uppercase variables range over classes, while lowercase variables range over sets.[9] Gödel also used names that begin with an uppercase letter to denote particular classes, including functions and relations defined on the class of all sets. Gödel's convention is used in this article. It allows us to write: ∃ x ϕ ( x ) {\displaystyle \exists x\,\phi (x)} instead of ∃ x ( ∃ C ( x ∈ C ) ∧ ϕ ( x ) ) {\displaystyle \exists x{\bigl (}\exists C(x\in C)\land \phi (x){\bigr )}} ∀ x ϕ ( x ) {\displaystyle \forall x\,\phi (x)} instead of ∀ x ( ∃ C ( x ∈ C ) ⟹ ϕ ( x ) ) {\displaystyle \forall x{\bigl (}\exists C(x\in C)\implies \phi (x){\bigr )}} The following axioms and definitions are needed for the proof of the class existence theorem. Axiom of extensionality.  If two classes have the same elements, then they are identical. ∀ A ∀ B [ ∀ x ( x ∈ A ⟺ x ∈ B ) ⟹ A = B ] {\displaystyle \forall A\,\forall B\,[\forall x(x\in A\iff x\in B)\implies A=B]}  [13] This axiom generalizes ZFC's axiom of extensionality to classes. Axiom of pairing.  If x {\displaystyle x} and y {\displaystyle y} are sets, then there exists a set p {\displaystyle p} whose only members are x {\displaystyle x} and y {\displaystyle y} . ∀ x ∀ y ∃ p ∀ z [ z ∈ p ⟺ ( z = x ∨ z = y ) ] {\displaystyle \forall x\,\forall y\,\exists p\,\forall z\,[z\in p\iff (z=x\,\lor \,z=y)]}  [14] As in ZFC, the axiom of extensionality implies the uniqueness of the set p {\displaystyle p} , which allows us to introduce the notation { x , y } . {\displaystyle \{x,y\}.} Ordered pairs are defined by: ( x , y ) = { { x } , { x , y } } {\displaystyle (x,y)=\{\{x\},\{x,y\}\}} Tuples are defined inductively using ordered pairs: ( x 1 ) = x 1 , {\displaystyle (x_{1})=x_{1},} For n > 1 : ( x 1 , … , x n − 1 , x n ) = ( ( x 1 , … , x n − 1 ) , x n ) . {\displaystyle {\text{For }}n>1\!:(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n-1},x_{n})=((x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n-1}),x_{n}).} [c] Class existence axioms and axiom of regula contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 91 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Bernays%E2%80%93G%C3%B6del_set_theory responseCode 3 200
