This group of states is officially known as the euro area or, commonly, the eurozone, and includes about 344 million citizens as of 2023[update]. The euro is divided into 100 euro cents.[5][6] The currency is also used officially by the institutions of the European Union, by four European microstates that are not EU members,[6] the British Overseas Territory of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, as well as unilaterally by Montenegro and Kosovo. Outside Europe, a number of special territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency. Additionally, over 200 million people worldwide use currencies pegged to the euro. The euro is the second-largest reserve currency as well as the second-most traded currency in the world after the United States dollar.[7][8][9][10][11] As of December 2019,[update] with more than €1.3 trillion in circulation, the euro has one of the highest combined values of banknotes and coins in circulation in the world.[12][13] The name euro was officially adopted on 16 December 1995 in Madrid.[14] The euro was introduced to world financial markets as an accounting currency on 1 January 1999, replacing the former European Currency Unit (ECU) at a ratio of 1:1 (US$1.1743 at the time). Physical euro coins and banknotes entered into circulation on 1 January 2002, making it the day-to-day operating currency of its original members, and by March 2002 it had completely replaced the former currencies.[15] Between December 1999 and December 2002, the euro traded below the US dollar, but has since traded near parity with or above the US dollar, peaking at US$1.60 on 18 July 2008 and since then returning near to its original issue rate. On 13 July 2022, the two currencies hit parity for the first time in nearly two decades due in part to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[16] Characteristics[edit] Administration[edit] The European Central Bank seat in Frankfurt am Main Main articles: European Central Bank, Maastricht Treaty, and Eurogroup The euro is managed and administered by the European Central Bank (ECB, Frankfurt am Main) and the Eurosystem, composed of the central banks of the eurozone countries. As an independent central bank, the ECB has sole authority to set monetary policy. The Eurosystem participates in the printing, minting and distribution of notes and coins in all member states, and the operation of the eurozone payment systems. The 1992 Maastricht Treaty obliges most EU member states to adopt the euro upon meeting certain monetary and budgetary convergence criteria, although not all participating states have done so. Denmark has negotiated exemptions,[17] while Sweden (which joined the EU in 1995, after the Maastricht Treaty was signed) turned down the euro in a non-binding referendum in 2003, and has circumvented the obligation to adopt the euro by not meeting the monetary and budgetary requirements. All nations that have joined the EU since 1993 have pledged to adopt the euro in due course. The Maastricht Treaty was later amended by the Treaty of Nice,[18] which closed the gaps and loopholes in the Maastricht and Rome Treaties. Eurozone members[edit] Main article: Eurozone The 20 participating members are Austria Belgium Croatia Cyprus[note 2] Estonia Finland France[note 3] Germany Greece Ireland Italy Latvia Lithuania Luxembourg Malta Netherlands[note 4] Portugal Slovakia Slovenia Spain EU members not using the euro[edit] The EU member states not in the Eurozone are Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Sweden. Future eurozone members[edit] Main article: Enlargement of the eurozone The government of Bulgaria aims to replace the Bulgarian lev by the euro on 1 January 2025.[19][20][21] The government of Romania aims for the Romanian leu to be replaced by the euro on 1 January 2026.[22] EU members Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Sweden are legally obligated to adopt the euro eventually, though they have no required date for adoption, and their governments do not currently have any plans for switching. Denmark negotiated for the right to retain its currency.

In Community legislative acts the plural forms of euro and cent are spelled without the s, notwithstanding normal English usage.[31][32] Otherwise, normal English plurals are used,[33] with many local variations such as centime in France. All circulating coins have a common side showing the denomination or value, and a map in the background. Due to the linguistic plurality in the European Union, the Latin alphabet version of euro is used (as opposed to the less common Greek or Cyrillic) and Arabic numerals (other text is used on national sides in national languages, but other text on the common side is avoided). For the denominations except the 1-, 2- and 5-cent coins, the map only showed the 15 member states which were members when the euro was introduced. Beginning in 2007 or 2008 (depending on the country), the old map was replaced by a map of Europe also showing countries outside the EU.[citation needed] The 1-, 2- and 5-cent coins, however, keep their old design, showing a geographical map of Europe with the 15 member states of 2002 raised somewhat above the rest of the map. All common sides were designed by Luc Luycx. The coins also have a national side showing an image specifically chosen by the country that issued the coin. Euro coins from any member state may be freely used in any nation that has adopted the euro. The coins are issued in denominations of €2, €1, 50c, 20c, 10c, 5c, 2c, and 1c. To avoid the use of the two smallest coins, some cash transactions are rounded to the nearest five cents in the Netherlands and Ireland[34][35] (by voluntary agreement) and in Finland and Italy (by law).[36] This practice is discouraged by the commission, as is the practice of certain shops of refusing to accept high-value euro notes.[37] Commemorative coins with €2 face value have been issued with changes to the design of the national side of the coin. These include both commonly issued coins, such as the €2 commemorative coin for the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, and nationally issued coins, such as the coin to commemorate the 2004 Summer Olympics issued by Greece. These coins are legal tender throughout the eurozone. Collector coins with various other denominations have been issued as well, but these are not intended for general circulation, and they are legal tender only in the member state that issued them.[38] Coin minting[edit] A number of institutions are authorised to mint euro coins: Bayerisches Hauptmünzamt, Munich (Mint mark: D) Currency Centre Fábrica Nacional de Moneda y Timbre Hamburgische Münze (J) Imprensa Nacional Casa da Moeda SA Istituto Poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato Koninklijke Nederlandse Munt Koninklijke Munt van België/Monnaie Royale de Belgique Mincovňa Kremnica Monnaie de Paris Münze Österreich Rahapaja Oy/Myntverket i F contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 38 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Euro responseCode 3 200
