It is the only family in the Moniliformida order and contains three genera: Australiformis containing a single species, Moniliformis containing eighteen species and Promoniliformis containing a single species. Genetic analysis have determined that the clade is monophyletic despite being distributed globally. These worms primarily parasitize mammals, including humans in the case of Moniliformis moniliformis, and occasionally birds by attaching themselves into the intestinal wall using their hook-covered proboscis. The intermediate hosts are mostly cockroaches. The distinguishing features of this order among archiacanthocephalans is the presence of a cylindrical proboscis with long rows of hooks with posteriorly directed roots and proboscis retractor muscles that pierce both the posterior and ventral end or just posterior end of the receptacle. Infestation with Monoliformida species can cause moniliformiasis, an intestinal condition characterized as causing lesions, intestinal distension, perforated ulcers, enteritis, gastritis, crypt hypertrophy, goblet cell hyperplasia, and blockages. Taxonomy and description[edit] Species of the family Moniliformidae are usually pseudosegmented and have a cylindrical proboscis with longitudinal rows of hooks that have posteriorly directed roots. Moniliformidae are further characterized by the presence of a simple, double-walled proboscis receptacle with the outer wall having spirally aligned muscle fibers (with the exception of Australiformis), brain at posterior end of receptacle, and dorsal and ventral lacunar canals.[2][3] The proboscis retractor muscles pierce both the posterior and ventral end or just posterior end of the receptacle.[4] The cerebral ganglion is in the mid to posterior region, and the lemnisci are long and flat and not bound to the body wall. These worms also lack protonephridia and males have eight cement glands, each with a giant nucleus, which are used to temporarily close the posterior end of the female after copulation.[2][3][5] Genetic analysis has been conducted on four species: Moniliformis moniliformis, M. saudi, M. cryptosaudi and M. kalahariensis.[6][7] Based on these results, Moniliformidae has been determined to be monophyletic.[6][7] Archiacanthocephala Archiacanthocephala Oligacanthorhynchidae Macracanthorhynchus ingens Oncicola venezuelensis Oligacanthorhynchus tortuosa Nephridiacanthus major Moniliformidae Moniliformis moniliformis Gigantorhynchida Mediorhynchus sp. Gigantorhynchus echinodiscus Phylogenetic reconstruction for select species in the class Archiacanthocephala[8][9] Species[edit] There are three genera and twenty living species in the order Moniliformida.[6][10][11][a] Australiformis[edit] Main article: Australiformis Australiformis is a monotypic genus that infest marsupials in Australia and New Guinea. Its body consists of a proboscis armed with hooks which it uses to pierce and hold the gut wall of its host, and a long trunk. It contains a single species, Australiformis semoni. This genus resembles species in the genus Moniliformis but is characterized by a lack of spiral muscles in the outer wall of the proboscis receptacle. The proboscis is armed with 12 rows of 13 to 15 hooks which are used to attach themselves to the small or large intestines of the host. The female worms range from 95 to 197 millimetres, long virtually all of which is the trunk, and 1.75 to 3.5 millimetres wide. There is pronounced sexual dimorphism in this species as females are around twice the size of the males whose trunks range from 46 to 80 millimetres long and 2 millimetres wide.[2] Infestation of marsupials by A. semoni may cause debilitating inflammation of the stomach (gastritis) with granulomatous ulcers.[12] Moniliformis[edit] Main article: Moniliformis The genus Moniliformis Travassos, 1915 contains eighteen species. Description of the genus is the same as the family Moniliformidae with the exception of possessing spiral muscles in the outer wall of the proboscis receptacle[2] and a single distinct kind of proboscis hooks.[13] Moniliformis acomysi Ward and Nelson, 1967[13] Moniliformis aegyptiacus Meyer, 1932[14] Moniliformis amini Martins, del Rosario Robles, and Navone 2017[15] Moniliformis cestodiformis (Linstow, 1904)[b] Moniliformis clarki (Ward, 1917)[c] Moniliformis convolutus Meyer, 1932 Moniliformis cryptosaudi Amin, Heckmann, Sharifdini, and Albayati, 2019[7] Moniliformis echinosorexi Deveaux, Schmidt and Krishnasamy, 1988[17] Moniliformis gracilis (Rudolphi, 1819)[d] Moniliformis ibunami[18] Moniliformis kalahariensis Meyer, 1931 Moniliformis moniliformis (Bremser, 1811)[e] Main article: Moniliformis moniliformis Moniliformis monoechinus (Linstow, 1902)[f] Moniliformis necromysi Gomes, Costa, Gentile, Vilela and Maldonado, 2020[19] Moniliformis saudi Amin, Heckmann, Mohammed, & Evans, 2016[6] The proboscis of Moniliformis saudi[6] Moniliformis siciliensis Meyer, 1932[g] Moniliformis spiralis Subrahmanian, 1927 Moniliformis tarsii Deveaux, Schmidt and Krishnasamy, 1988[17] Moniliformis travassosi Meyer, 1932 Promoniliformis[edit] The genus Promoniliformis Dollfus and Golvan, 1963[20] is characterized by possessing two distinct kinds of proboscis hooks.[13] There is only one species in this genus. Promoniliformis ovocristatus (Linstow, 1897)[h] P. ovocristatus has been found parasitizing tenrecs in Madagascar[21] including the tailless tenrec (Tenrec ecaudatus) and the lesser hedgehog tenrec (Echinops telfairi). The largest female was 222 mm long and 1.1 to 1.5 mm wide whereas the largest male was much smaller at 65 mm long and 0.85 to 1 mm wide. There is no pseudosegmentation as seen in Moniliformis species. The proboscis is 0.550 mm long and 0.250 to 0.300 mm wide at the widest point. The proboscis contains 20 to 24 longitudinal rows of 8 to 10 hooks each with the 4 or 5 superior hooks being large and possessing well-developed roots whereas the 4 or 5 inferior hooks are small and have reduced roots. The receptacle measures 0.550 to 0.650 mm long with a maximum width of 0.125 mm. It is the type species.[20] Hosts[edit] Moniliformidae species are found in the intestines parasitizing mammals and occasionally birds.[4] Intermediate hosts are mostly cockroaches but also other insect groups.[6] Infestation can cause moniliformiasis, which is characterized as lesions in the intestines, intestinal distension, perforated ulcers, enteritis, crypt hypertrophy, goblet cell hyperplasia, and occlusions of the intestinal tract in the gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis).[22] Hosts for Moniliformidae species The Southern brown bandicoot is a host for Australiformis semoni The Cairo spiny mouse is a host of Moniliformis acomysi The four-toed jerboa is a host of Moniliformis aegyptiacus The North African hedgehog is a host of Moniliformis aegyptiacus The cotton-top tamarins is a host of Moniliformis clarki The large flying fox is a host of Moniliformis convolutus The long-eared hedgehog is a host of Moniliformis cryptosaudi The moonrat is a host of Moniliformis echinosorexi The giant anteater is a host of Moniliformis monoechinus The desert hedgehog is a host of Moniliformis saudi The brown rat is a host of M. siciliensis and Moniliformis travassosi The garden dormouse is a host of M. siciliensis The black rat is a host of Moniliformis spiralis The Horsfield's tarsier is a host of Moniliformis tarsii Promoniliformis ovocristatus is a parasite of the tailless tenrec Promoniliformis ovocristatus is a parasite of the lesser hedgehog tenrec Notes[edit] ^ A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than the present genus. ^ M. cestodiformis originally named Echinorhynchus cestodiformis by von Linstow in 1904[16] but was renamed by Travassos in 1917.
