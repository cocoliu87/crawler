Spanning over 2,383 km (1,481 mi) the temples are simultaneously located on Longitudinal line 79°E, that pass over Kedarnath in the North to Rameshwaram in the South India. The temples are constructed on a line to align with Kedarnath temple located near the Mandakini river, in the state of Uttarakhand. Seven of these eight temples are situated in the South Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, and five of these temples represent the Pancha Bhuta Sthalam—each representing a manifestation of the five prime elements of nature: earth, water, fire, air, and space.[1][2] Though not an ancient temple, the Ramappa Temple constructed in the year 1213 CE, is also a Shiva temple in Warangal, Telangana, it was also constructed on the same Longitude 79E, and in the year 2021, Ramappa Temple was declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[3][4] These temples are spread over 2,383 km (1,481 mi) apart from each other with a distance of hundreds of kilometers. The temples are: Kedarnath Temple; Uttarakhand, Kaleshwara Mukteswara Swamy Temple; Telangana, Srikalahasteeswara Temple; Andhra Pradesh, Ekambareswarar Temple, Jambukeswara Temple, Annamalaiyar Temple, Nataraja Temple and Ramanathaswamy Temple; Tamil Nadu.[5][6] Legends[edit] The location of temples are separated by hundreds of kilometers with each other and it is still mysterious about the purpose of constructing the temples with the geographical alignment. As per scholars there are no relevant records to prove the motivation behind the construction in similar fashion and it could be a coincidence or esoteric.[7][5] Though according to the Puranic Hinduism perspective, these temple are built at a very place where some divine events occurred, according to a popular legend the Kedarnath temple was constructed by the Pandavas—the five legendary brothers who ware central characters of the Mahabharata. Another legend suggest that the temple is believed to be built on the spot where Shiva disappeared. The prevailing Kedarnath temple was restructured by Adi Shankara—a 8th Century Hindu scholar and teacher, his samadhi is constructed behind the Kedarnath temple, and according to G.C Pande (2011); Adi Shankara died in Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu a city which houses one of the Shiva temple (the Shiva Shakti Aksha Rekha).[8][9] According to Outlook India as published on 16 June 2023; Historians and archaeologists had initiated a research program to explore the mysterious construction of theses temples in the single geographical alignment.[1] List of famous temples[edit] Temple Photo Location Details Kedarnath Temple Kedarnath 30°44′6.7″N 79°4′0.9″E﻿ / ﻿30.735194°N 79.066917°E﻿ / 30.735194; 79.066917 It is one of the twelve jyotirlinga of Shiva.
