Over sixty people were killed in airstrikes on 31 October, and much of the market was destroyed.[3] Forty-five people were killed in an airstrike on the next day, and part of a residential complex was destroyed. According to Israel the camp is a stronghold for Hamas and other militant groups.[4][5][6] Background The Jabalia refugee camp market is considered one of the most lively areas in the Gaza Strip. It is located in the northeast of Gaza City. There is a residential area in the market, the Al-Ternis area, which is considered part of the market, the largest commercial market in Gaza.[7] UNRWA registered 116,011 Palestinian refugees in the camp.[8] Strikes 9 October Following Israeli airstrikes on other areas of Gaza, internally displaced Gazans fled to the Jabaliya camp.[3] At the time of the attack, the market was completely full, with customers and vendors stocking up on goods.[3] The airstrike hit the al-Trans area of the Jabalia market, one of the most populated areas of Jabaliya.[9][10][11] Survivors of the attack, speaking to France 24, stated that the airstrike "hit in the heart of the market", and in the immediate aftermath, there were many dead. Many of the bodies were unable to be recovered in the days following the airstrike, due to a lack of equipment.[12] A rescue worker speaking to the New York Times stated that the death toll was over sixty people killed, and the entire market and surrounding buildings were destroyed.[3] Gaza's health ministry declined to give a full estimate, but reported "dozens" of dead and wounded.[13] Gaza's interior ministry also claimed that the airstrike initially targeted a residential building belonging to the Abu Eshkayyah family.[14] The Israeli government claimed that the Jabalia airstrike targeted elements of Hamas located in a mosque in the Jabalia camp.[15] 12 October On 12 October, a second airstrike on the Jabalia camp hit a residential building was hit, destroying several apartments, and killing people from two families.[16] Gaza's Interior Ministry reported 45 people were killed, and at least four others injured.[17] Some were sheltering there after being displaced from Beit Hanoun.[18][19] 19 October On 19 October, the camp was hit by a third airstrike, killing 18 refugees. [20] 22 October The camp was bombed for a fourth time during a particularly intense bombardment of Gaza. Multiple homes were bombed and at least 30 bodies have been recovered from the rubble.[21] 31 October Main article: 31 October 2023 Jabalia refugee camp airstrike On 31 October, the camp was bombed again by Israeli fighter jets.[22] The IDF said the attack was meant to target a key leader of the 7 October attacks Ibrahim Biari, as well as a "vast underground tunnel complex" beneath the camp that according to the IDF Biari was commanding operations from.[23] Hamas denied the presence of any commander and said Israel was using these claims as an excuse for the attack.[24] An eyewitness interviewed by CNN spoke of "apocalyptic scenes": "Children were carrying other injured children and running, with grey dust filling the air. Bodies were hanging on the rubble, many of them unrecognized. Some were bleeding and others were burnt. ... I saw women screaming and confused. They didn't know whether to cry for losing their children or run and look for them, especially since many children were playing in the neighborhood."[25] Atef Abu Seif, Minister of Culture of the Palestinian Authority of President Mahmoud Abbas and a well-known critic of Hamas, likewise spoke of "apocalyptic" scenes to Der Spiegel, saying more than 50 houses were "smashed, crushed. In each house there were dozens of people, families and relatives who had fled here from outside because their areas were bombed ... They bombed the center, the heart of the refugee camp. No place in all of Palestine is probably as densely populated as this. Now we can't even make out where which building began and ended."[26] Al Jazeera reporter Anas Al Shareef was on the scene, stating, "It's a massive massacre. It is hard to count the number of buildings that have been destroyed here."[27] Nebal Farsakh, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent, described the scene as "absolutely horrific."[28] More than a hundred people were reported missing beneath the rubble.[29] The Gaza Interior Ministry stated the camp had been "completely destroyed," with preliminary estimates of about 400 wounded or dead.[30] The director of the Indonesia Hospital reported more than 50 dead.[31] IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari confirmed that Israeli fighter jets attacked the refugee camp.[32] IDF spokesman Richard Hecht described civilian deaths as a tragic consequence of war and accused Hamas of using the local population as human shields, noting that civilians had been warned to move south.[25] 1 November Less than a day after the 31 October airstrike which killed at least 50 people, Jabalia was bombed again.[33] The Civil Defense in Gaza described the airstrike as a "second massacre" which destroyed several buildings surrounding the camp and killed at least 80 people and wounded hundreds more.[34] The IDF said the strike killed "the head of [Hamas's] anti-tank missile unit, Muhammad A'sar".[35] 2 November On 2 November, another airstrike in the Jabalia refugee camp hit the UNRWA-sponsored Abu Hussein school, home to many displaced Gazans.[36] 4 November Further information: Al-Fakhoora school airstrike External videos Gazan child speaks of having to carry decapitated body after Israeli strike on Jabalia on 4 November (via The Irish Times) On 4 November, a UNRWA spokeswoman confirmed reports that Israel had conducted another airstrike against a UN-run school in the Jabalia refugee camp.[37] According to the Gaza health ministry, the attack on the Al-Fakhoura school killed fifteen and wounded dozens more.[37] Reuters reported having obtained a video of a boy crying in despair: "I was standing here when three bombings happened, I carried a body and another decapitated body with my own hands. God will take my vengeance."[37] According to UNRWA, at least one strike hit the schoolyard, where displaced families had set up their tents.[37] In response to the strike, Al Jazeera remarked Israel was "trying to eliminate all sources of survival for the civilian population to force the evacuation to the southern part of Gaza."[38] 13 November Israel bombed the camp, destroying twelve houses and killing more than 30 people.[39] The civil defence team reported being unable to rescue injured people from the rubble due to a lack of equipment.[39] 14 November Israeli airstrikes killed two volleyball players Hassan Zuaiter and Ibrahim Qusaya at the refugee camp.[40] 17 November Israel hit several residential buildings, killing and wounding an unknown number.[41] Residents and rescue workers reportedly used axes, hammers, and their bare hands to try to find survivors.[42] Reactions Norwegian doctor and pro-Palestinian activist Mads Gilbert stated, "There is absolutely no doubt that this is a mass murder."[43] Melanie Ward, the chief executive of the UK-nonprofit Medical Aid for Palestinians, stated, "This attack marks a new low and should serve as a wake-up call to world leaders and politicians everywhere. Their meek requests for compliance with international law are being ignored entirely; Israel has instead increased the ferocity of its indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks."[44] Doctors Without Borders condemned the airstrike, stating "Enough is enough!"[45] The attack was immediately condemned by the Egyptian, Saudi, Jordanian, and Qatari foreign ministries.[46] Bolivia severed diplomatic relations with Israel, and Colombia and Chile recalled their ambassadors.[47] UN Special Rapporteurs stated the attacks were a "brazen violation of international law – and a war crime."[48] See also Al-Shati refugee camp airstrike Outline of the 2023 Israel–Hamas war References ^ Abdulrahim, Raja; Haro contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 65 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Jabalia_refugee_camp_airstrikes responseCode 3 200
