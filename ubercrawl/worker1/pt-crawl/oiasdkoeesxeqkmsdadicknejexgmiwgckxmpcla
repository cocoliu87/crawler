Among its alumnae have been Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Dorothy Hodgkin, Iris Murdoch, Vera Brittain and Dorothy L. Sayers. It began admitting men in 1994.[4] Its library is one of Oxford's largest college libraries. The college's liberal tone[5] derives from its founding by social liberals, as Oxford's first non-denominational college for women, unlike the Anglican Lady Margaret Hall, the other to open that year.[6] In 1964, it was among the first to cease locking up at night to stop students staying out late.[7][8] No gowns are worn at formal halls. In 2021 it was recognised as a sanctuary campus by City of Sanctuary UK.[9] It is one of three colleges to offer undergraduates on-site lodging throughout their course.[10] It stands near the Science Area, University Parks, Oxford University Press, Jericho, and Green Templeton, St Anne's, Keble and St Benet's. Over a third of its 650 students are not from the UK.[11] Over half the UK admissions are from state schools – close to the university average.[12] Its total net assets in 2021 were £238 million,[2] the seventh highest of an Oxford undergraduate college. Its sister college at Cambridge is Girton. History[edit] Founding[edit] In June 1878, the Association for the Higher Education of Women was formed, aiming for the eventual creation of a college for women in Oxford. Some of the more prominent members of the association were George Granville Bradley, Master of University College, T. H. Green, a prominent liberal philosopher and Fellow of Balliol College, and Edward Stuart Talbot, Warden of Keble College. Talbot insisted on a specifically Anglican institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot's group (the "Christ Church camp") founded Lady Margaret Hall, which opened its doors for students in 1879, the same year as Somerville did.[13] Thus, in 1879, a second committee was formed to create a college "in which no distinction will be made between students on the ground of their belonging to different religious denominations."[14] This committee was called the "Balliol camp" and had close ties to the Liberal Party.[15][16] This second committee included A. H. D. Acland, Thomas Hill Green, George William Kitchin, James Legge, Henry Nettleship, Walter Pater, Henry Francis Pelham, its chairman John Percival, Grace Prestwich, Eleanor Smith, A. G. Vernon Harcourt, and Mary Ward.[16] Other people who assisted in the founding were Anna Swanwick, Bertha Johnson, Charlotte Byron Green, and Owen Roberts.[17] The mathematician and scientist Mary Somerville, 1780–1872, after whom the college is named This new effort resulted in the founding of Somerville Hall, named after the then recently deceased Scottish mathematician and renowned scientific writer Mary Somerville.[13] It was felt that the name would reflect the virtues of liberalism and academic success which the college wished to embody.[18] She was admired by the founders of the college as a scholar, as well as for her religious and political views, including her conviction that women should have equality in terms of suffrage and access to education.[19] Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre was chosen as the first principal because, though not a well-known academic at the time, her background was felt to reflect the college's political stance.[20] Because of its status as both women's college and non-denominational institution, Somerville was widely regarded within Oxford as "an eccentric and somewhat alarming institution."[21] Women's college[edit] When it opened, Somerville Hall had twelve students, ranging in age between 17 and 36.[22] The first 21 students from Somerville and Lady Margaret Hall attended lectures in rooms above a baker's shop on Little Clarendon Street.[23] Just two of the original 12 students admitted in 1879 remained in Oxford for three years, the period of residence required for male students to complete a bachelor's degree.[24] Increasingly, however, as the college admitted more students, it became more formalized. Somerville appointed Lilla Haigh as its first in-house tutor in 1882,[25] and by the end of the 1890s female students were permitted to attend lectures in almost all colleges.[26] In 1891 it became the first women's hall to introduce entrance exams and in 1894 the first of the five women's halls of residence to adopt the title of college (changing its name to Somerville College),[27] the first of them to appoint its own teaching staff, and the first to build a library.[28] In Oxford legend it soon became known as the "bluestocking college", its excellent examination results refuting the widespread belief that women were incapable of high academic achievement.[28] In the 1910s, Somerville became known for its support for the women's suffrage campaign.[29] In 1920, Oxford University allowed women to matriculate and therefore gain degrees.[30] From the college's inception, all female students had to be chaperoned when in the presence of male students. The practice was abolished in 1925, although male visitors to the college were still subject to a curfew.[31] In the same year the college was granted its charter.[32] Somerville College Library with hyacinths The Mutual Admiration Society[edit] The Mutual Admiration Society (MAS) was a literary society (or literary circle) of women who became friends at Somerville College.[33][34] Its members included Dorothy L. Sayers,[35][36] Muriel St Clare Byrne, Charis Frankenburg, Dorothy Rowe, and Amphilis Throckmorton Middlemore, among others.[37][34] The society of the title was a real club. The members composed poetry and prose for each other's pleasure. Apart from Sayers, none of them was a household name, though all were notable. Mo Moulton argued in their Agatha Award-winning book, The Mutual Admiration Society: How Dorothy L. Sayers and Her Oxford Circle Remade the World For Women,[38] that each one lived a life worthy of attention.[39][40][41][42] Years later, the writer Vera Brittain — a Somerville contemporary of the group, but not one of its members — recalled that the MAS “took themselves very seriously”.[43][44] First World War[edit] During the First World War, Somerville College together with the Examination Schools and other Oxford buildings were requisitioned by the War Office to create the Third Southern General Hospital, a facility for the Royal Army Medical Corps to treat military casualties.[45][46] For the duration of the war, Somerville students relocated to Oriel College.[29] Because many male students had left Oxford to enlist in the military, Somerville was able to rent St Mary Hall Quad which they bricked off from the rest of the college to segregate it from Oriel's remaining male students.[47] Many students and tutors were involved in work in World War I and some of them went to the Western Front in France.[48] Notable patients who stayed in Somerville include the war poets Robert Graves, Siegfried Sassoon and R. E. Vernède. Sassoon arrived on 2 August 1916. Graves and Sassoon were both to reminisce of their time at Somerville Hospital: How unlike you to crib my idea of going to the Ladies' College at Oxford, Sassoon wrote to Graves in 1917, and called it very much like Paradise.[49] At Somerville College, Graves met his first love, a nurse and professional pianist called Marjorie. About his time at Somerville, he wrote: I enjoyed my stay at Somerville. The sun shone, and the discipline was easy.[50] Alfred Mills was received in the hospital in 1916 and officer Llewelyn Davies died at the college.[51] Once the war ended, the return to normality between Oriel and Somerville was delayed, sparking both frustration and an incident in spring 1919 known as the "Oriel raid," in which male students made a hole in the wall dividing the sexes.[52] In July 1919 the principal (Emily Penrose) and fellows returned to Somerville.[53] Alumna Vera Brittain wrote about the impact of the war in Oxford and paid tribute to the work of the principal, Miss Penrose, in her memoir Testament of Youth. Admission of men[edit] Starting in the 1970s, the traditionally all-male colleges in Oxford began to admit female students.[54] Since it was assumed that recruiting from a wider demographic would guarantee better students, there was pressure on single-sex colleges to change their policy to avoid falling down the rankings.[55] All-female colleges, like Somerville, found it increasingly difficult to attract good applicants and fell to the bottom of the intercollegiate academic rankings during the period.[56] During the 1980s, there was much debate as to whether women's colleges should become mixed. Somerville remained a women's college until 1992, when its statutes were amended to permit male students and fellows; the first male fellows were appointed in 1993, and the first male students admitted in 1994.[57] Somerville became the second-to-last college (aft contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 60 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Somerville_College,_Oxford responseCode 3 200
