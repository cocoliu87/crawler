It says "© AP" on the lower left corner of the photo. -- 199.71.174.100 30 June 2005 01:23 (UTC) Huh, so it does. Whoops. Sorry. --Golbez June 30, 2005 06:31 (UTC) No, and this is very embarrassing that we used the photo.

(...) project participants said in a joint declaration after their meeting here (at the Moscow conference) Tuesday. [1] - background: [2]. This agreement seems quite significant to me, both on the scientific and international fronts. --Edcolins June 28, 2005 09:46 (UTC) May I offer an alternative arrangement: Cadarache, in southern France, has been chosen as the site for the €10-billion ITER experimental nuclear fusion reactor. --Kitch 28 June 2005 11:52 (UTC) Adding a dot at the end of the sentence would be better. Too bad I can't do it myself. Cheers. --Edcolins June 28, 2005 12:41 (UTC) Also the image is labelled as "Flag of Bulgaria"! --Edcolins June 28, 2005 12:44 (UTC) Eh? Whoa!

Is there a basketball league in the world with a higher profile and an international following than the NBA ? The NBA Finals were definitely in the headlines in many newspapers around the world. -- 64.229.224.205 12:34, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC) The Detroit Pistons winning the NBA Finals was posted on ITN last year, why not this year ? -- 199.71.174.100 17:45, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC) Which news story should I remove to fit this one?

There is so much room on the right side on the Front Page, perhaps we don't need to remove anything. -- 64.229.207.200 23:32, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC) Only if you have a large monitor, which not everyone has. - Ta bu shi da yu 02:50, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC) The blank space on the right side of the Front Page disappeared yesterday because the Featured Article was very short. The blank space is now back. -- 64.229.225.42 28 June 2005 03:37 (UTC) The blank space has disappeared once again, this time due to a very, very long DYK. ...sigh... -- 64.229.221.245 28 June 2005 12:21 (UTC) The blank space is back. -- 199.71.174.100 29 June 2005 20:08 (UTC) Gone again with another short Featured Article. :-) Never mind. -- 199.71.174.100 30 June 2005 01:18 (UTC) In Iran, Mayor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Tehran wins the 2005 presidential election, and will succeed President Mohammad Khatami on August 2. -- 64.229.224.205 13:02, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC) The United States Supreme Court, in Kelo v. New London, rules that, under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, local governments may condemn private houses in order to use the land for uses that are primary commercial, so long as such use serves a demonstrated "public use." It's a bit long and should probably link to the article on the case Kelo v. New London. I'd fix it up myself but it's almost 1:30 now and I'd proably make 10 gramatical errorrs. I need some sleep.

We already have Killen on there, I'm surprised they didn't raise holy hell about that one. --Golbez 06:38, Jun 24, 2005 (UTC) To avoid such complaints I removed killin when adding this one.

Voting doesn't count; only the result of the vote matters. Others may disagree. However, once we have a victor, then this will certainly be ITN-worthy. --Golbez 03:18, Jun 18, 2005 (UTC) I see your point, but there is precedent for this: the UK General Election in May, and the Dutch and French EU referenda votes all were reported in progress (and I'm sure there are older examples). I think that the attention the Iranian vote has received makes this as significant an event as those. But in any case I supppose we should wait now until we get official word on who'll be in the run-off.
