Israel retaliated by launching drone strikes and artillery shells at Hezbollah positions near Lebanon's boundary with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The outbreak of the clashes had followed Hezbollah's declaration of support and praise for the Hamas attack on Israel, which took place on 7 October.[17][18] It is currently the largest escalation of the Hezbollah–Israel conflict to have occurred since the 2006 Lebanon War. Events October 8 October IDF footage of strike on Hezbollah infrastructure in the Shebaa Farms In the morning, Hezbollah fired rockets and shells at the Shebaa Farms region; in response, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) fired artillery shells and a drone into southern Lebanon.[19][20][21] Two Lebanese children were reportedly injured by broken glass.[22] 9 October Israel exchanged a series of airstrikes on Southern Lebanon near the towns of Marwahin, Ayta ash Shab[23] and Dhayra in the Bint Jbeil district.[24] This was after numerous Palestinian militants infiltrated the Israeli border.[25] The IDF killed at least two perpetrators (likely Palestinians),[24] while a third returned to Lebanon.[26] A Hezbollah media source announced that one of their members died in the IDF retaliation. Hezbollah denied involvement in the incident, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militia claimed responsibility for the armed infiltration.[2] Hezbollah later announced the death of two other militants at night.[27] Hezbollah fired rockets and artillery in retaliation.[28] During the clashes, two Israeli soldiers and Lt. Col Alim Abdallah Deputy Commander of Israel's 300th Brigade, died of wounds inflicted by enemy fire on the border and another three were wounded.[2][29] 10 October Hezbollah and the IDF exchanged fire, with Hezbollah firing a salvo of rockets into Israel and an attack on the security forces brought out by the Palestinian factions.[30] Hezbollah fired an anti-tank guided missile at an Israeli military vehicle in the Avivim area, prompting a retaliatory Israeli helicopter strike.[31] 11 October Hezbollah fired anti-tank missiles at an Israeli military position and claimed to have produced casualties. In response, the IDF shelled the area where the attack was launched.[32] The Lebanese-Italian hospital in Tyre admitted three injured civilians.[33] The IDF ordered residents of northern Israel to seek shelter following reports of drones being launched from southern Lebanon.[34] A Patriot missile was launched to intercept a suspicious projectile, after which the IDF found that the object in question was not a drone.[35] Warning sirens were activated across northern Israel after reports emerged that up to 20 infiltrators on paragliders had entered Israeli territory from Lebanon, before the IDF dismissed the report as a false alarm.[36] 12 October The Israeli Defence Ministry announced that one soldier was killed and another injured by an anti-tank missile fired by Hezbollah.[37] 13 October Hezbollah deputy chief Sheikh Naim Qassem said that 'when time comes for any action, we will carry it out' stating that Hezbollah was ready and 'would "contribute" to confrontations against Israel according to its own plan'.[38] The IDF fired artillery into southern Lebanon following an explosion that caused minor damage to a section of the Israel–Lebanon border wall near the kibbutz of Hanita.[39] Lebanese Reuters video journalist, Issam Abdallah, was killed, while at least six other journalists from Reuters, AFP and Al Jazeera were injured.[40] The Lebanese Army said that two others were injured during the strike.[41] 14 October The IDF released footage of a drone attack which, according to them, killed three infiltrators from Lebanon near Margaliot who were members of Hamas.[42] One of them was acknowledged by Hezbollah as one of their members. In the afternoon, Hezbollah fired 50 mortar shells and six anti-tank missiles towards five Israeli outposts in the Shebaa Farms.[41] Further IDF shelling killed two civilians in a Shebaa village; video and photographic evidence showed usage of phosphorus bombs.[43] 15 October Hezbollah launched five anti-tank missiles towards northern Israel killing one civilian and injuring three others in Shtula.[44][45] UNIFIL said that their headquarters in Naqoura in southern Lebanon was hit by rocket fire with no casualties reported.[46] Lieutenant Amitai Granot, commander of the 75th Battalion of the IDF's Golan Brigade and son of Rabbi Tamir Granot, was killed in a missile attack on an IDF post bordering Lebanon.[47][48] 16 October The IDF announced the evacuation of residents of settlements two kilometers away from the Lebanese border.[49] In the afternoon, shots were fired towards IDF positions near the border which Hezbollah claimed responsibility for.[50] The IDF responded with artillery fire. Hezbollah said that it had started destroying surveillance cameras on several Israeli Army posts.[51] In the evening, anti-tank missiles were fired at an IDF tank and gunshots were aimed towards multiple army positions. The IDF attacked the sources of the fire with artillery. There were no reported casualties in either exchanges on that day.[52] Amnesty International reported that the IDF fired white phosphorus shells into Dhayra, hospitalizing nine civilians and setting fire to civilian objects.[53] Aya Majzoub, the Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International, described the attack as a violation of international law that needed to be investigated as a war crime, and that it "seriously endangered the lives of civilians, many of whom were hospitalized and displaced, and whose homes and cars caught fire".[54] 17 October Lebanese state media reported that Dhayra and other areas along the western section of the border came under "continuous" bombardment overnight.[55] In the early morning it was reported that multiple people were suffering from symptoms of suffocation after the IDF allegedly fired whit contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 76 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/2023_Israel%E2%80%93Lebanon_border_clashes responseCode 3 200
