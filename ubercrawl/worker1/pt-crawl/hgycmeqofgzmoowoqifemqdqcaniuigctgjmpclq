matches.[7][8][9][10] Initially, the Test match at the Adelaide Oval was planned to be a day/night fixture, but the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) declined the offer from Cricket Australia to play the match under lights.[11] In April 2018, the Western Australian Cricket Association confirmed that the Perth Stadium would host its first ever Test match.[12] During the second Test, it became the tenth venue in Australia to host a Test match.[13] India's regular wicket-keeper for limited overs matches, MS Dhoni, was not named in the side's squad for the T20I fixtures for this series and the ones against the West Indies.[14] Instead, India's Test wicket-keeper, Rishabh Pant, was selected in Dhoni's place.[15] The T20I series was drawn 1–1, after the second match finished in a no result.[16] India won the Test series 2–1, after the fourth match of the series finished as a draw.[17] India became the first Asian team to win a Test series in Australia.[18][19] In the ODI series that followed, Australia won the first match by 34 runs, recording their 1,000th win in international cricket.[20] However, India went on to win the next two games, and consequently the series 2–1;[21] in the process recording their first bilateral ODI series victory in Australia.[22][23] Squads[edit] Tests ODIs T20Is Australia[24] India[25] Australia[26] India[27] Australia[28]
