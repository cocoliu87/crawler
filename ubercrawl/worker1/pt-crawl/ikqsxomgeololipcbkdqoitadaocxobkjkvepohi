Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi (Urdu: عمران احمد خان نیازی; born 5 October 1952) is a Pakistani politician and former cricketer who served as the 22nd prime minister of Pakistan from August 2018 until April 2022. He is the founder and chairman of the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). Born to a Niazi Pashtun family in Lahore, Khan graduated from Keble College, Oxford. He began his international cricket career in a 1971 Test series against England. Khan played until 1992, served as the team's captain intermittently between 1982 and 1992, and won the 1992 Cricket World Cup, Pakistan's only victory in the competition. Considered one of cricket's greatest all-rounders, Khan was later inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. Founding the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in 1996, Khan won a seat in the National Assembly in the 2002 general election, serving as an opposition member from Mianwali until 2007. PTI boycotted the 2008 general election and became the second-largest party by popular vote in the 2013 general election. In the 2018 general election, running on a populist platform, PTI became the largest party in the National Assembly, and formed a coalition government with independents with Khan as prime minister. As prime minister, Khan addressed a balance of payments crisis with bailouts from the IMF. He presided over a shrinking current account deficit, and limited defence spending to curtail the fiscal deficit, leading to some general economic growth. He enacted policies that increased tax collection and investment. His government committed to a renewable energy transition, launched the Ehsaas Programme and the Plant for Pakistan initiative, and expanded the protected areas of Pakistan. He presided over the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused economic turmoil and rising inflation in the country, threatening his political position. Amid a constitutional crisis, Khan became the first prime minister to be removed from office through a no-confidence motion in April 2022. In August, he was charged under anti-terror laws after accusing the police and judiciary of detaining and torturing an aide. In October, Khan was disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan from taking office for the current term of the National Assembly of Pakistan, regarding the Toshakhana reference case. In November, he survived an assassination attempt during a political rally in Wazirabad, Punjab. On 9 May 2023, Khan was arrested on corruption charges at the Islamabad High Court by paramilitary troops who smashed their way into the courthouse. Protests broke out throughout Pakistan resulting in the arrest of several thousands of Khan's supporters along with military installations being ransacked. After his release, he blamed the Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir for his arrest. The army responded by terming 9 May as "Black Day", with Minister of MoPD Ahsan Iqbal terming it as Pakistan's 9/11. He was sentenced to a three-year jail term on 5 August 2023 and was subsequently arrested for the second time.[2] Early life and family Further information: Family of Imran Khan Khan was born in Lahore on 5 October 1952.[3] Earlier, some reports suggest he was born on 25 November 1952.[4][5][6][7] It was reported that 5 October was wrongly mentioned by Pakistan Cricket Board officials on his passport.[8] He is the only son of Ikramullah Khan Niazi, a civil engineer, and his wife Shaukat Khanum, and has four sisters.[9] Long settled in Mianwali in northwestern Punjab, his paternal family are of Pashtun ethnicity and belong to the Niazi tribe,[10][11] and one of his ancestors, Haibat Khan Niazi, in the 16th century, "was one of Sher Shah Suri's leading generals, as well as being the governor of Punjab."[12] Like his father, Khan's mother was an ethnic Pashtun, who belonged to the Burki tribe and whose ancestors had been settled in the Jalandhar district of Punjab for centuries. Following the creation of Pakistan, she migrated to Lahore with the rest of Khan's maternal relatives.[13] Khan's maternal family has produced a number of cricketers, including those who have represented Pakistan,[9] such as his cousins Javed Burki and Majid Khan.[10] Maternally, Khan is also a descendant of the Sufi warrior-poet and inventor of the Pashto alphabet, Pir Roshan, who hailed from his maternal family's ancestral Kaniguram town located in South Waziristan in the tribal areas of northwest Pakistan.[14] His maternal family was based in Basti Danishmanda, Jalandhar, India for about 600 years.[15][16] A quiet and shy boy in his youth, Khan grew up with his sisters in relatively affluent, upper middle-class circumstances[17] and received a privileged education. He was educated at the Aitchison College and Cathedral School in Lahore,[18][19] and then the Royal Grammar School Worcester in England, where he excelled at cricket. In 1972, he enrolled in Keble College, Oxford where he studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics, graduating in 1975.[20] An enthusiast for college cricket at Keble, Paul Hayes, was instrumental in securing the admission of Khan, after he had been turned down by Cambridge.[21] Personal life He had numerous relationships during his bachelor life.[22] He was then known as a hedonistic bachelor and a playboy who was active on the London nightclub circuit.[22][23][24] Many girlfriends are unknown and were called "mysterious blondes" by British newspaper The Times.[25] Some of the women he has been associated with include Zeenat Aman,[26] Emma Sergeant, Susie Murray-Philipson, Sita White, Sarah Crawley,[25] Stephanie Beacham, Goldie Hawn, Kristiane Backer, Susannah Constantine, Marie Helvin, Caroline Kellett,[27] Liza Campbell,[10] Anastasia Cooke, Hannah Mary Rothschild,[28] and Lulu Blacker.[29][30] His first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, an artist and the daughter of British investor Sir Patrick Sergeant, introduced him to socialites.[25] They first met in 1982 and subsequently visited Pakistan.[28] She accompanied him on various Pakistani cricket team tours including in Peshawar and Australian tour.[28] After long separations, his relationship with Sergeant was broken in 1986.[25] He then had a short relationship with Susie Murray-Philipson whom he invited to Pakistan and had dinner with in 1982.[25] She also made various artistic portraits of Khan during their relationship.[31][32] In a book published in 2009, Christopher Sandford claimed that former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Imran Khan had a close relationship when both were students in Oxford.[33] He wrote that Bhutto at the age of 21 first became close to Khan in 1975. They remained in a relationship for about two months.[33] His mother also tried to have an arranged marriage between them.[33] He further claimed that they had a "romantic relationship", which was refuted by Khan who said they were only friends.[33] Khan had a notable relationship with the heiress Sita White, daughter of the British industrialist Gordon White.[22][34] They remained in the relationship for about six years having met in 1987–88.[35] White claimed that Khan agreed to have a child with h contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 44 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Imran_Khan responseCode 3 200
