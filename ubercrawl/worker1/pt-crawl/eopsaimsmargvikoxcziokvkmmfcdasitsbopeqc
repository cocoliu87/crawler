I haven't been so active in recent months, but when I come back from time to tine I see all your great work on historical football topics.

Cbl62 (talk) 17:08, 9 July 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Thank you very much, Cbl62 - this means a lot coming from you! And wow, I'm surprised my creations have received that many views - when I joined back in November 2020 (initially only to write two things), I would never have guessed I would go on to create things read by millions! BeanieFan11 (talk) 17:19, 9 July 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Page views are an indication that people care for the subjects about which you are writing. You garnered 3.7 million views in just two-and-a-half years. That total will continue to grow in the years (and decades) ahead. Keep it up!
