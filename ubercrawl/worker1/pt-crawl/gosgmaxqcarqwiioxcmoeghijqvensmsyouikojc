Anglo-America is distinct from Latin America, a region of the Americas where Romance languages (e.g., Spanish, Portuguese, and French) are prevalent.[2] The adjective is commonly used, for instance, in the phrase "Anglo-American law", a concept roughly coterminous with Common Law.[3][4] Geographic region[edit] While Canada is one of the two principal Anglo-American countries, the province of Quebec and the region of Inuit Nunangat both have non-English speaking majorities, for this reason they are excluded from Anglo-America. Sint Eustatius, Sint Maarten, and Saba are also not typically included in Anglo-America, despite their English-speaking majorities, because they are constituent countries or public bodies that form part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
