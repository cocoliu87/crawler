The captives are likely being held in different locations in the Gaza Strip.[17] Hamas's demands included a prisoner exchange, fuel and other supplies, the opening of the Rafah Border Crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip, and a suspension of Israeli airstrikes and shelling.[18] Several countries have been involved in negotiations, with Qatar taking the lead.[18] Hamas has offered releasing all hostages in exchange for Israel releasing all Palestinian prisoners,[19] a position supported by some Israeli families.[20] Background See also: Palestinian prisoners in Israel and List of Arab–Israeli prisoner exchanges The issue of hostages and prisoners is considered emotional for both Israelis and Palestinians; since 1967, 750,000 to 1 million Palestinians have been arrested by Israel.[21][22][23] As of November 2023, there are over 10,000 Palestinians (including at least 170 children[22]) in Israeli jails and prisons.[24][25] Some have been convicted of terrorism by Israeli authorities; the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories describes many convictions as resulting from "a litany of violations of international law, including due process violations, that taint the legitimacy of the administration of justice by the occupying power."[4][26] 1,200 Palestinians are held without any charges or trial; Israel justifies the practice citing security reasons.[27][28] Israel has engaged in prisoner exchanges with armed groups on several occasions.[29] In 2006, Hamas captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Israel secured his release in 2011, in exchange for the release of 1,000 Palestinians from Israeli custody, including some it had convicted of terrorism.[4][21] On 31 August 2023, Israel warned its citizens that Hamas was trying to kidnap them.[30] At the time of its attack, Hamas was already holding two Israelis hostage: Ethiopian Israeli Avera Mengistu (since 2014) and Bedouin Israeli Hisham al-Sayed (since 2015). Hamas has also sought to ransom the remains of Israeli soldiers Oron Shaul and Hadar Goldin, which they seized during the 2014 Gaza War.[31] Events of October 7 Main article: 2023 Hamas attack on Israel On the morning of 7 October 2023, around 6:30 a.m. IST, Hamas launched an attack into Israel from multiple sites on its border with the Gaza Strip. The attack included ground and motorized infiltration into Israeli territory, attacks on Israel Defense Forces bases and exchanges of fire with security forces, massacres and shooting of Israeli civilians, and takeovers of communities and military facilities. The ground incursion was combined with and backed by a sustained barrage of thousands of rockets.[32] At around 7:00 am, Hamas militants raided many communities and kibbutzim (intentional communities) in the Gaza periphery area of Israel. They carried out massacres in more than 10 kibbutzim, as well as a massacre at a music festival near Re'im resulting in at least 260 deaths.[33][34][35] The Economist described the combined attacks as "the biggest terror attack in [Israel's] history".[35] As part of Israel's counteroffensive, Israel implemented a "total blockade" of the Gaza strip until the hostages have been released.[36] Amnesty International describes this measure as having been "taken to punish civilians in Gaza for the actions of Palestinian armed groups," amounting to collective punishment.[37] In the initial wave of attacks, militants kidnapped civilians and brought them back to Gaza as captives.[4][5][38] According to statements by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, around 200 soldiers and civilians were captured or abducted during the raid on the Gaza periphery communities.[39][40] Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, an IDF spokesperson, reported on 7 October that military officers were among those captured.[41] Israel confirmed the identity of 203 captives, among them 30 children,[42] while Gaza spokespeople reported holding roughly 200, estimating that another 50 were held by other factions.[43] The IDF says it captured "handbooks" made by Hamas to instruct its militants; these handbooks instructed to "kill the difficult" captives, and use the rest as human shields.[44] Blindfolded teddy bears covered with red blood stains, at Tel Aviv Dizengoff Square, representing the 30 children who were kidnapped by Hamas Civilians believed to be held captive in Gaza include families, children, festival-goers, peace activists, caregivers, and older adults.[45] 75-year-old historian Alex Danzig who has written books on Poland's Jewish community and the Holocaust, was taken from Nir Oz.[5][46] Also at Nir Oz, members of the Silberman-Bibas family were taken from their home, including an infant and 3-year-old.[47][48] Images taken by the Associated Press also showed an unidentified elderly woman being kidnapped.[38] Some of the hostages are from France, Germany, Russia, United Kingdom, and the United States.[18][49] At least seventeen Thai citizens working in greenhouses in the Gaza periphery were also kidnapped.[18][49][50] Nepal confirmed seven of its citizens who are university students were kidnapped in Herzliya and ten more Nepalis in Alumim were abducted.[51] At least one Filipino was abducted.[52] Videos There is a video depicting at least 64 of the abductees.[53] Video analysis from The Washington Post shows that some of the captives were executed after their capture.[54] Israeli student Noa Argamani, who was at the trance party near Re'im, was kidnapped while with her partner Avinathan Or.[5][55][56][57] They were filmed being taken by the militants to Gaza, after WhatsApp messages they sent asking for help from their hiding place from 8:10 a.m. were exposed.[55] The footage showed Argamani being taken on a motorcycle while reaching out for Or, who was led away by his captors on foot.[55] On 19 November 2023, the Israeli military released reported CCTV footage that they claim shows hostages being lead into Al - Shifa hospital on October 7. This was in the wake of Israel being put under pressure to substantiate claims that Hamas was operating an expansive command center under the hospital leading to its siege. However, shortly after the release BBC News indicated that they were unable to independently corroborate the claims and is not the evidence that Israel claimed to have.[58] Treatment of captives Billboard in Tel Aviv calling for the return of Israeli hostages in Gaza On 13 October, Hamas released a video purporting to demonstrate its compassion towards abducted children. The video shows armed Hamas soldiers patting children on the back, rocking children in a stroller, and giving a child water.[59] On 16 October, Hamas released a video of a 21-year-old French Israeli woman pleading to be returned to her family, while someone bandages her injured arm and a scar is visible.[60] Many hostages require medical treatment due to their medical conditions (such as Parkinson's, cardiovascular diseases, heart failure, diabetes mellitus and cancer), according to a report sent to ICRC on October 15 by Dr. Hagai Levine of The Hostages and Missing Families Forum.[61] On 24 October, one of the released hostages, Yocheved Lifshitz, described her experience. She said initially, upon capture, she was beaten on the motorcycle ride back to Gaza, but was later treated well: "They treated us gently, and provided all our needs”, according to Lifshitz.[62][63] She described being taken to a network of tunnels, and kept in groups of five people, with each group assigned a guard.[64] Their captors reportedly told them they believe in the Qur'an and would not hurt them. Lifshitz said she received medical care, one meal a day, and clean conditions.[64] A former IDF mental health officer said returning hostages who have experienced continual psychological trauma will be very cautious about saying anything that endangers other captives. contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 78 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/2023_Israel%E2%80%93Hamas_war_hostage_crisis responseCode 3 200
