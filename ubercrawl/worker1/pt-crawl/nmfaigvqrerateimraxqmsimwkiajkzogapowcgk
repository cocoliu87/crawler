History[edit] Angle brackets or chevrons ⟨ ⟩ were the earliest type of bracket to appear in written English. Erasmus coined the term lunula to refer to the round brackets or parentheses ( ) recalling the shape of the crescent moon (Latin: luna).[1] Most typewriters only had the left and right parentheses. Square brackets appeared with some teleprinters. Braces (curly brackets) first became part of a character set with the 8-bit code of the IBM 7030 Stretch.[2] In 1961, ASCII contained parenthesis, square, and curly brackets, and also less-than and greater-than signs that could be used as angle brackets. Typography[edit] In English, typographers mostly prefer not to set brackets in italics, even when the enclosed text is italic.[3] However, in other languages like German, if brackets enclose text in italics, they are usually also set in italics.[4] Parentheses or (round) brackets[edit] Several terms redirect here.

( and ) are called parentheses /pəˈrɛnθɪsiːz/ (singular parenthesis /pəˈrɛnθɪsɪs/) in American English, and "brackets" informally in British English; they are also known as "round brackets", "parens" /pəˈrɛnz/, "circle brackets", or "smooth brackets".[5] In careful or formal writing, "parentheses" is also used in British English. Uses of ( )[edit] Parentheses contain adjunctive material that serves to clarify (in the manner of a gloss) or is aside from the main point.[6] A comma before or after the material can also be used, though if the sentence contains commas for other purposes, visual confusion may result. A dash before and after the material is also sometimes used. Parentheses may be used in formal writing to add supplementary information, such as "Senator John McCain (R - Arizona) spoke at length". They can also indicate shorthand for "either singular or plural" for nouns, e.g. "the claim(s)". It can also be used for gender-neutral language, especially in languages with grammatical gender, e.g. "(s)he agreed with his/her physician" (the slash in the second instance, as one alternative is replacing the other, not adding to it). Parenthetical phrases have been used extensively in informal writing and stream of consciousness literature. Examples include the southern American author William Faulkner (see Absalom, Absalom! and the Quentin section of The Sound and the Fury) as well as poet E. E. Cummings. Parentheses have historically been used where the dash is currently used in alternatives, such as "parenthesis)(parentheses". Examples of this usage can be seen in editions of Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage. Parentheses may be nested (generally with one set (such as this) inside another set). This is not commonly used in formal writing (though sometimes other brackets [especially square brackets] will be used for one or more inner set of parentheses [in other words, secondary {or even tertiary} phrases can be found within the main parenthetical sentence]). Language[edit] A parenthesis in rhetoric and linguistics refers to the entire bracketed text, not just to the enclosing marks used (so all the text in this set of round brackets may be described as "a parenthesis").[7] Taking as an example the sentence "Mrs Pennyfarthing (What? Yes, that was her name!) was my landlady.", the explanatory phrase between the parentheses is itself called a parenthesis. Again, the parenthesis implies that the meaning and flow of the bracketed phrase is supplemental to the rest of the text and the whole would be unchanged were the parenthesized sentences removed. The term refers to the syntax rather than the enclosure method: the same clause in the form "Mrs Pennyfarthing – What? Yes, that was her name! – was my landlady" is also a parenthesis.[8] (In non-specialist usage, the term "parenthetical phrase" is more widely understood.[9]) In phonetics, parentheses are used for indistinguishable[10] or unidentified utterances. They are also seen for silent articulation (mouthing),[11] where the expected phonetic transcription is derived from lip-reading, and with periods to indicate silent pauses, for example (…) or (2 sec). Enumerations[edit] An unpaired right parenthesis is often used as part of a label in an ordered list, such as this one: a) educational testing, b) technical writing and diagrams, c) market research, and d) elections. Accounting[edit] Traditionally in accounting, contra amounts are placed in parentheses. A debit balance account in a series of credit balances will have parenthesis and vice versa. Parentheses in mathematics[edit] Main articles: Glossary of mathematical symbols § Parentheses, and Bracket (mathematics) Parentheses are used in mathematical notation to indicate grouping, often inducing a different order of operations. For example: in the usual order of algebraic operations, 4 × 3 + 2 equals 14, since the multiplication is done before the addition. However, 4 × (3 + 2) equals 20, because the parentheses override normal precedence, causing the addition to be done first. Some authors follow the convention in mathematical equations that, when parentheses have one level of nesting, the inner pair are parentheses and the outer pair are square brackets. Example: [ 4 × ( 3 + 2 ) ] 2 = 400. {\displaystyle [4\times (3+2)]^{2}=400.} Parentheses in programming languages[edit] Parentheses are included in the syntaxes of many programming languages. Typically needed to denote an argument; to tell the compiler what data type the Method/Function needs to look for first in order to initialise. In some cases, such as in LISP, parentheses are a fundamental construct of the language. They are also often used for scoping functions and operators and for arrays. In syntax diagrams they are used for grouping, such as in extended Backus–Naur form. In Mathematica and the Wolfram language, parentheses are used to indicate grouping – for example, with pure anonymous functions. Taxonomy[edit] If it is desired to include the subgenus when giving the scientific name of an animal species or subspecies, the subgenus's name is provided in parentheses between the genus name and the specific epithet.[12] For instance, Polyphylla (Xerasiobia) alba is a way to cite the species Polyphylla alba while also mentioning that it is in the subgenus Xerasiobia.[13] There is also a convention of citing a subgenus by enclosing it in parentheses after its genus, e.g., Polyphylla (Xerasiobia) is a way to refer to the subgenus Xerasiobia within the genus Polyphylla.[14] Parentheses are similarly used to cite a subgenus with the name of a prokaryotic species, although the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP) requires the use of the abbreviation "subgen." as well, e.g., Acetobacter (subgen. Gluconoacetobacter) liquefaciens.[15] Chemistry[edit] Parentheses are used in chemistry to denote a repeated substructure within a molecule, e.g. HC(CH3)3 (isobutane) or, similarly, to indicate the stoichiometry of ionic compounds with such substructures: e.g. Ca(NO3)2 (calcium nitrate). In chemical nomenclature, parentheses are used to distinguish structural features and multipliers for clarity, for example in the polymer poly(methyl methacrylate).[16] Square brackets[edit] Square brackets [ ] Look up square bracket, Unsupported titles/Square brackets, Unsupported titles/Right square bracket, Unsupported titles/Left square bracket, or crotchet in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. Sometimes called simply "brackets" in American English. An older name for brackets is "crotchets".[17] Uses of [ ][edit] Square brackets are often used to insert explanatory material or to mark where a [word or] passage was omitted from an original material by someone other than the original author, or to mark modifications in quotations.[18] In transcribed interviews, sounds, responses and reactions that are not words but that can be described are set off in square brackets — "... [laughs] ...". When quoted material is in any way altered, the alterations are enclosed in square brackets within the quotation to show that the quotation is not exactly as given, or to add an annotation.[19] For example: The Plaintiff asserted his cause is just, stating, [m]y causes is [sic] just. In the original quoted sentence, the word "my" was capitalized: it has been modified in the quotation given and the change signalled with brackets. Similarly, where the quotation contained a grammatical error (is/are), the quoting author signalled that the error was in the original with "[sic]" (Latin for 'thus'). A bracketed ellipsis, [...], is often used to indicate omitted material: "I'd like to thank [several unimportant people] for their tolerance [...]"[20] Bracketed comments inserted into a quote indicate where the original has been modified for clarity: "I appre contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 47 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Quine_corners responseCode 3 200
