It was initially scheduled for five days, but time lost during the game to rain interruptions meant that the planned reserve day was used.[1] New Zealand won the match by eight wickets to be crowned as the winners of the inaugural ICC World Test Championship.[2][3] New Zealand won the ICC Test Championship mace for the first time,[4][5] and were also awarded the cash prize of US$1.6 million, while India won US$800,000.[6] It was New Zealand's second major ICC trophy win after emerging victorious at the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy,[7] and Kane Williamson became the second New Zealand captain after Stephen Fleming to win an ICC event.[8] On winning the final, Williamson said it was a "very special occasion and a fantastic feeling".[9] India's captain, Virat Kohli, acknowledged that New Zealand were the better team, but also called for a best-of-three series to decide future World Test Championships.[10] New Zealand's Kyle Jamieson was named as the man of the match, after taking seven wickets, including a five-wicket haul in the first innings.[11] Background[edit] Panorama of the Rose Bowl, Southampton, the venue for the final match India and New Zealand qualified for the final as the top two teams in the league stage of the 2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and multiple series being postponed, the league standings were determined by percentage of points earned.[12][13] On 2 February 2021, Australia postponed their away series against South Africa, resulting in a guaranteed berth in the final for New Zealand.[14][15] On 6 March 2021, India also confirmed their berth for the final, after beating England by 3–1 in a home Test series.[16] The final was initially due to be held at Lord's, but on 10 March 2021 the International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed that the game had been moved to the Rose Bowl as the ground's on-site hotels made the venue suitable to establish a bubble environment, made necessary by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.[17][18] England had used the ground for some of their international fixtures in 2020.[19] On 8 June 2021, the ICC appointed the match officials for the final, with Michael Gough and Richard Illingworth named as the on-field umpires.[20] Prior to the final, the Indian team played a four-day intra-squad practice match between Captain Virat Kohli XI and Captain KL Rahul XI at the Rose Bowl.[21] Indian cricketers had not played in any matches since the suspension of the 2021 Indian Premier League on 4 May 2021.[22] In contrast, the New Zealand team had played a two match Test series against England in the first two weeks of June.[23] If the match was either a draw or ended in a tie, both teams would have been declared as joint winners, sharing the trophy.[24] On 14 June 2021, the ICC confirmed the prize money for the final:[25] the winning team would receive US$1.6 million along with ICC Test Championship Mace, the losing team US$800,000, and the two teams would share US$2.4 million in the event of a draw.[26] Road to the final[edit] Main article: 2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship § League stage Route to the final[edit] India[27] Round New Zealand[28] Opponent Result League stage Opponent Result West Indies (A) India 2 – 0 West Indies Series 1 Sri Lanka (A) New Zealand 1 – 1 Sri Lanka South Africa (H) India 3 – 0 South Africa Series 2 Australia (A) New Zealand 0 – 3 Australia Bangladesh (H) India 2 – 0 Bangladesh Series 3 India (H) New Zealand 2 – 0 India New Zealand (A) India 0 – 2 New Zealand Series 4 West Indies (H) New Zealand 2 – 0 West Indies Australia (A) India 2 – 1 Australia Series 5 Pakistan (H) New Zealand 2 – 0 Pakistan England (H) India 3 – 1 England Series 6 League stage 1st Place Pos Team P W L D PC Pts PCT 1 India 6 5 1 0 720 520 72.20 In reference to number of series played Final League standings League stage 2nd Place Pos Team P W L D PC Pts PCT 2 New Zealand 5 3 1 1 600 420 70.00 In reference to number of series played 2021 ICC World Test Championship Final Squads[edit] India[29] New Zealand[30] Virat Kohli (c) Ajinkya Rahane (vc) Ravichandran Ashwin Jasprit Bumrah Shubman Gill Ravindra Jadeja Rishabh Pant (wk) Cheteshwar Pujara Wriddhiman Saha (wk) Mohammed Shami Ishant Sharma Rohit Sharma Mohammed Siraj Hanuma Vihari Umesh Yadav Kane Williamson (c) Tom Latham (vc) Tom Blundell (wk) Trent Boult Devon Conway Colin de Grandhomme Matt Henry Kyle Jamieson Henry Nicholls Ajaz Patel Tim Southee Ross Taylor Neil Wagner BJ Watling (wk) Will Young On 15 June 2021, New Zealand confirmed their squad of 15 players for the match.[31] Doug Bracewell, Jacob Duffy, Daryl Mitchell, Rachin Ravindra and Mitchell Santner, who were all part of New Zealand's initial squad for the match,[32] were not included in the final 15.[33] On the same day India named their squad of 15 players for the match.[34] Mayank Agarwal, K.

No play was possible on days 1 and 4 due to rain. 33.2 overs were lost on day 2 due to bad light. The planned reserve day was used to make up time lost earlier in the match. Match officials[edit] On-field umpires: Michael Gough and Richard Illingworth Third umpire: Richard Kettleborough Reserve umpire: Alex Wharf Match referee: Chris Broad Summary[edit] Day 1[edit] The first day of play was scheduled to take place on Friday 18 June 2021. As had been forecast, there was heavy rain throughout the day which prevented any play from taking place. The rain stopped in the afternoon, but it had caused the outfield to become waterlogged and the umpires decided to cancel the day's play at 3pm BST. The loss of six hours ensured that the game would continue to the sixth and reserve day on Wednesday 23 June.[38] Day 2[edit] Players and match officials gathering in the field ahead of the start of Day 2 of the inaugural WTC Final The weather was dry at the start of the second day, and with no rain forecast, play began on time at 10:30am.[39] New Zealand won the toss and elected to field first, putting India in to bat. Captain Kane Williamson said that his decision was due to the cool weather, although he said that he expected a consistent wicket throughout the game.[40] India's opening batsmen, Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill, began the match strongly by recording an opening partnership of 62 runs. Despite favourable conditions New Zealand's fast bowlers Tim Southee and Trent Boult were unable to bowl consistently.[41] Kyle Jamieson started bowling before lunch and took the first wicket of the match, Rohit Sharma edging a ball to third slip where it was caught by Southee.[42] Gill then fell too, caught off the bowling of Neil Wagner, to leave India at 69 for two at lunch, with Cheteshwar Pujara and Indian captain Virat Kohli the two batsmen.[43] Kyle Jamieson bowling to Cheteshwar Pujara in the inaugural WTC Final Pujara and Kohli batted cautiously early in their partnership, both before and after lunch, with Pujara taking 50 minutes and 35 balls to score his first run. He then scored successive fours but was dismissed after 16 more runless balls, leg before wicket (lbw) to Boult.[42][44] The score at that point was 88 for three, with Ajinkya Rahane joining Kohli at the crease. There were several interruptions for bad light during the afternoon session, first forcing an early tea, and then eventually ending the day's play after only 64.4 overs with India on 146.[45][44] Kohli and Rahane remained as the not out batsmen overnight, on 44 and 29 runs respectively.[46] Day 3[edit] Fans enjoying the WTC Final on Day 3 morning The third day was another day of rain showers, and play was delayed slightly, beginning at 11am. Kohli fell in the third over of the day, lbw to Jamieson without adding to his overnight score of 44. Rishabh Pant was dismissed a few overs later, caught by Tom Latham at slip off Jamieson's bowling on only 4 runs. Rahane and new batsman Ravindra Jadeja withstood the New Zealand bowling for a while after this, with Rahane advancing his score to 49.[47] He was then dismissed by Wagner, playing a hook shot which was caught at mid wicket. Former Indian player V. V. S. Laxman attributed the wicket to Williamson's captaincy, noting that the captain had set the field differently in successive balls and given Wagner advice regarding Rahane's reputation for being a "compulsive pull shot or hook shot player".[48] Ravichandran Ashwin came to the crease and scored quickly, recording 22 runs from 27 balls and taking India past 200.[49] He lost his wicket shortly afterwards, edging a catch to slip off the bowling of Southee. India were 211 for seven at lunch.[50] In the third over after lunch, Jamieson took two wickets in two balls, dismissing Ishant Sharma with a ball which was caugh contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 72 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/2021_ICC_World_Test_Championship_final responseCode 3 200
