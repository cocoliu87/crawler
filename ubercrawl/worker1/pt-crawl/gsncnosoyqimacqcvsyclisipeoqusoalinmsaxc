Christ the King Cathedral in Ende History[edit] The archdiocese was established on 16 September 1913 as Apostolic Prefecture of Lesser Sunda Islands, on territory split from what was then Apostolic Vicariate of Batavia (now Archdiocese of Jakarta, then covering the Dutch East Indies). On 12 March 1922 the prefecture was promoted to Apostolic Vicariate of Lesser Sunda Islands (curiate Italian: Isole della Piccola Sonda), hence entitled to a titular bishop. On 25 February 1936 the vicariate was split to establish the Apostolic Vicariate of Dutch Timor. On 10 July 1950 the vicariate was split to establish the Apostolic Prefecture of Denpasar. On 8 March 1951 it was named Apostolic Vicariate of Endeh, after its see, having lost territories to establish the Apostolic Vicariate of Larantuka and the Apostolic Vicariate of Ruteng. On 20 October 1959 another split established the Apostolic Prefecture of Weetebula. On 3 January 1961 it became Metropolitan Archdiocese of Endeh. On 14 May 1974 it was renamed Metropolitan Archdiocese of Ende. On 14 December 2005 the archdiocese was again split to establish the diocese of Maumere.
