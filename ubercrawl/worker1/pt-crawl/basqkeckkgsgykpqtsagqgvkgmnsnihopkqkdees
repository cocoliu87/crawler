It is the county town and contains the headquarters of Durham County Council, the unitary authority which governs the district of County Durham.[3][4] It had a population of 48,069 at the 2011 Census. The city was built on a meander of the River Wear, which surrounds the centre on three sides and creates a narrow neck on the fourth. The surrounding land is hilly, except along the Wear's floodplain to the north and southeast. Durham was founded in 995 by Anglo-Saxon monks seeking a place safe from Viking raids to house the relics of St Cuthbert. The church the monks built lasted only a century, as it was replaced by the present Durham Cathedral after the Norman Conquest; together with Durham Castle it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. From the 1070s until 1836 the city was part of the County Palatine of Durham, a semi-independent jurisdiction ruled by the bishops of Durham which acted as a buffer between the kingdoms of England and Scotland. In 1346 the Battle of Neville's Cross was fought immediately outside the city, resulting in an English victory, and in 1650 the cathedral was used to house Scottish prisoners after the Battle of Dunbar. During the Industrial Revolution the Durham coalfield was heavily exploited, and there were several collieries close to the city; although the pits have closed, the annual Durham Miners' Gala continues. Historically, Durham was also known for the manufacture of hoisery, carpets, and mustard.[5] The city is the home of Durham University, which was founded in 1832 and therefore has a claim to be the third-oldest university in England. The university is a significant employer, alongside the local and national government and the University Hospital of North Durham, and the city has a significant tourism sector.[6] HM Prison Durham is also located close to the city centre. Toponymy[edit] The name "Durham" comes from the Brythonic element dun, signifying a hill fort and related to -ton, and the Old Norse holme, which translates to island.[7] The Lord Bishop of Durham takes a Latin variation of the city's name in his official signature, which is signed "N. Dunelm".[7] Some attribute the city's name to the legend of the Dun Cow and the milkmaid who in legend guided the monks of Lindisfarne carrying the body of Saint Cuthbert to the site of the present city in 995 AD.[8] Dun Cow Lane is said to be one of the first streets in Durham, being directly to the east of Durham Cathedral and taking its name from a depiction of the city's founding etched in masonry on the south side of the cathedral.[8] The city has been known by a number of names throughout history. The original Nordic Dun Holm was changed to Duresme by the Normans and was known in Latin as Dunelm. The modern form Durham came into use later in the city's history. The north-eastern historian Robert Surtees chronicled the name changes in his History and Antiquities of the County Palatine of Durham but states that it is an "impossibility" to tell when the city's modern name came into being.[7] Durham is likely to be Gaer Weir in Armes Prydein, derived from Brittonic cajr meaning "an enclosed, defensible site" (cf. Carlisle; Welsh caer) and the river-name Wear.[9] History[edit] Early history[edit] Archeological evidence suggests a history of settlement in the area since roughly 2000 BC.[7] The present city can clearly be traced back to AD 995, when a group of monks from Lindisfarne chose the strategic high peninsula as a place to settle with the body of Saint Cuthbert, that had previously lain in Chester-le-Street, founding a church there.[8] City origins, the Dun Cow story[edit] Legend of the founding of Durham (from a carving on the north side of the cathedral) Local legend states that the city was founded in A.D. 995 by divine intervention. The 12th-century chronicler Symeon of Durham recounts that after wandering in the north, Saint Cuthbert's bier miraculously came to a halt at the hill of Warden Law and, despite the effort of the congregation, would not move.[10] Aldhun, Bishop of Chester-le-Street and leader of the order, decreed a holy fast of three days, accompanied by prayers to the saint.[11] During the fast, Saint Cuthbert appeared to a certain monk named Eadmer, with instructions that the coffin should be taken to Dun Holm.[11] After Eadmer's revelation, Aldhun found that he was able to move the bier, but did not know where Dun Holm was.[11] The legend of the Dun Cow, which is first documented in The Rites of Durham, an anonymous account about Durham Cathedral, published in 1593, builds on Symeon's account.[12] According to this legend, by chance later that day, the monks came across a milkmaid at Mount Joy (southeast of present-day Durham). She stated that she was seeking her lost dun cow, which she had last seen at Dun Holm. The monks, realising that this was a sign from the saint, followed her.[11] They settled at a wooded "hill-island" – a high wooded rock surrounded on three sides by the River Wear.[11] There they erected a shelter for the relics, on the spot where Durham Cathedral would later stand.[11] Symeon states that a modest wooden building erected there shortly thereafter was the first building in the city.[10] Bishop Aldhun subsequently had a stone church built, which was dedicated in September 998.[13] This no longer remains, having been supplanted by the Norman structure. The legend is interpreted by a Victorian relief stone carving on the north face of the cathedral and, more recently, by the bronze sculpture 'Durham Cow' (1997, Andrew Burton), which reclines by the River Wear in view of the cathedral. Medieval era[edit] A map of the city from 1610 During the medieval period the city gained spiritual prominence as the final resting place of Saint Cuthbert and Saint Bede the Venerable. The shrine of Saint Cuthbert, situated behind the High Altar of Durham Cathedral, was the most important religious site in England until the martyrdom of St Thomas Becket at Canterbury in 1170.[8] Saint Cuthbert became famous for two reasons. Firstly, the miraculous healing powers he had displayed in life continued after his death, with many stories of those visiting the saint's shrine being cured of all manner of diseases. This led to him being known as the "wonder worker of England".[8] Secondly, after the first translation of his relics in 698 AD, his body was found to be incorruptible.[14] Apart from a brief translation back to Holy Island during the Norman Invasion[15] the saint's relics have remained enshrined to the present day.[16] Saint Bede's bones are also entombed in the cathedral, and these also drew medieval pilgrims to the city.[8] Durham's geographical position has always given it an important place in the defence of England against the Scots.[17] The city played an important part in the defence of the north, and Durham Castle is the only Norman castle keep never to have suffered a breach.[18] In 1314, the Bishopric of Durham paid the Scots a 'large sum of money' not to burn Durham.[19] The Battle of Neville's Cross took place near the city on 17 October 1346 between the English and Scots and was a disastrous loss for the Scots.[20] The city suffered from plague outbreaks in 1544, 1589 and 1598.[21] Bishops of Durham[edit] See also: Bishop of Durham and County Palatine of Durham Owing to the divine providence evidenced in the city's legendary founding, the Bishop of Durham has always enjoyed the title "Bishop by Divine Providence"[22] as opposed to other bishops, who are "Bishop by Divine Permission".[7] However, as the north-east of England lay so far from Westminster, the bishops of Durham enjoyed extraordinary powers such as the ability to hold their own parliament,[7] raise their own armies,[8] appoint their own sheriffs and Justices, administer their own laws, levy taxes and customs duties, create fairs and markets, issue charters,[10] salvage shipwrecks, collect revenue from mines, administer the forests and mint their own coins.[7] So far-reaching were the bishop's powers that the steward of Bishop Antony Bek commented in 1299 AD: "There are two kings in England, namely the Lord King of England, wearing a crown in sign of his regality and the Lord Bishop of Durham wearing a mitre in place of a crown, in sign of his regality in the diocese of Durham".[23] All this activity was administered from the castle and buildings surrounding the Palace Green.[8] Many of the original buildings associated with these functions of the county palatine survive on the peninsula that constitutes the ancient city.[17] The entrance to Durham Castle, the bishops' palace until 1832 whe contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 49 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Durham,_England responseCode 3 200
