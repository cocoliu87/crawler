The series is named after distinguished former captains, Australia's Allan Border and India's Sunil Gavaskar. It is played via the International Cricket Council's future tours. As of March 2023[update], India retained the trophy after defeating Australia 2–1 in the 2023 series. If a series is drawn, the country holding the trophy retains it. In competition for the trophy since 1996, Indian Sachin Tendulkar has been the most successful batsman, scoring 3262 runs from 65 innings.[1] Australian Nathan Lyon is the most successful bowler, taking 116 wickets over 26 matches at an average of 32.40.[2] Background[edit] Unofficial Test series[edit] The first ever cricket encounter between India and Australia was Australia's 1935-36 tour of India to play a series of four unofficial Tests. It was followed by the Australian Services cricket team which toured India in 1945-46.

The tours were irregularly scheduled with long gaps between them. Australia and India faced each other in the 2023 World Test Championship final, the first Test since 1991–92 between the two teams where the Border-Gavaskar Trophy was not contested.

The importance of the series is also fuelled by Australia's desire to beat India in a Test match series in India, which, until their victory in the 2004–05 series, they had not done so since 1969–70. India has developed a reputation of being particularly difficult to beat at home, having lost only two Test series since 1986–87. Conversely, India had never managed to win a Test series in Australia until 2018–19 series, after which they continued their winning streak in the 2020-21 series, thereby retaining the trophy for two editions outside home. The competitiveness of the series played between the two sides is also reflected in the fact that in both 2000–01 and 2007–08, it was India who ended Australia's runs of 16 consecutive Test wins. Matches in India are commonly described with labels like final frontier or iconic event. The Test series held in India in 2000–01 was labelled the final frontier by Steve Waugh and it lived up to its reputation; it had the closest result in decades with India overpowering the mighty Australians in the final session of the final Test at Chennai. The series also gave the cricketing world three champion cricketers in Hayden, Harbhajan and Laxman[5] who were relatively unknown or under-performing till then. They were the cornerstones of the series and the duels between Laxman & Australian bowlers on the one hand; and Harbhajan & Hayden on the other are often termed the most engrossing player rivalries in a Test series of cricket. The series was played in the backdrop of the death of legendary Sir Donald Bradman who was quoted as saying that he was very much looking forward to the series and had high expectations of both the teams. The competitiveness of series played under the trophy is illustrated by the approximately equal number of Test wins each side has achieved.

This was also Sachin Tendulkar's first series as captain. The series consisted of just one match, played at the Feroz Shah Kotla Ground in Delhi. 10–14 October 1996 Scorecard Australia v India 182 (73 overs) Michael Slater 44 (96) Anil Kumble 4/63 (24 overs) 361 (131.4 overs) Nayan Mongia 152 (366) Paul Reiffel 3/35 (17 overs) 234 (108.3 overs) Steve Waugh 67* (221) Anil Kumble 5/67 (41 overs) 58/3 (13.2 overs) Mohammed Azharuddin 21* (12) Paul Reiffel 2/24 (6 overs) India won by 7 wickets Feroz Shah Kotla Ground, Delhi Umpires: S. Venkataraghavan (India) and Peter Willey (England) Player of the match: Nayan Mongia (India) Australia won the toss and elected to bat. The match, played from 10 to 14 October 1996, lasted just over four days, as India defeated Australia by seven wickets. Australia won the toss and elected to bat. But the Indian spinners, led by Anil Kumble, bowled them out for 182. Michael Slater top scored with 44 runs. In reply India scored 361, riding on Nayan Mongia's career best 152. In Australia's second innings, Steve Waugh scored 67 to get his team to 234. This left India with 56 to get in the fourth innings, which they did for the loss of three wickets. 1997–98 series[edit] Main article: Australian cricket team in India in 1997–98 Sachin Tendulkar, top-scorer in the series. The Australian cricket team headed over to India in February–March 1998 looking to get their first win in India since the 1969–70 tour.[6] The first Test in Chennai saw Sachin Tendulkar scoring 155 from 191 balls to give India the win by 179 runs with Australia crumbling under the spin trio of Anil Kumble, Venkatapathy Raju and Rajesh Chauhan as they got out on 168.[7] The second Test at Kolkata saw another dominating performance from one of the Indian batsman with Mohammad Azharuddin 163 runs in India's only innings as India won the Test match by an innings and keeping the Border–Gavaskar Trophy in India.[8] The final Test at Bangalore saw Sachin Tendulkar get his second hundred of the series. In response, Mark Waugh got the Australians first century of the series with 153*. Australia with the help of Mark Taylor century would chase down the 194 runs that India set for them as they got the consolation win from the series to end the series at 2–1 in favour of India.[9] At the end of the tour, Shane Warne famously said that he would be having nightmares of Tendulkar hitting him for sixes and that only Bradman was in his class.[10] 1999–2000 series[edit] Main article: Indian cr contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 56 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Border-Gavaskar_Trophy responseCode 3 200
