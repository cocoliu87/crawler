Criteria[edit] Conflict deaths in the 17 deadliest conflicts 2015–2020 This list of ongoing armed conflicts identifies present-day conflicts and the death toll associated with each conflict. The criteria of inclusion are the following: Armed conflicts consist in the use of armed force between two or more organized armed groups, governmental or non-governmental.[1] Interstate, intrastate and non-state armed conflicts are listed. This is not a list of countries by intentional homicide rate, and criminal gang violence is generally not included unless there is also significant military or paramilitary involvement. Fatality figures include battle-related deaths (military and civilian) as well as civilians intentionally targeted by the parties to an armed conflict. Only direct deaths resulting from violence are included for the current and past year; excess deaths indirectly resulting from famine, disease, or disruption of services are included along with violent deaths in the cumulative fatalities count when available. Listed conflicts have at least 100 cumulative deaths in total and at least 1 death in current or in the past calendar year. Fatality totals may be inaccurate or unavailable due to a lack of information. A figure with a plus symbol, indicates that at least that many people have died (e.g. 455+ indicates that at least 455 people have died). Location refers to the states where the main violence takes place, not to the warring parties. Italics indicate disputed territories and unrecognized states. A territorial dispute or a protest movement which has not experienced deliberate and systematic deaths due to state or paramilitary violence is not considered to be an armed conflict. Major wars (10,000 or more combat-related deaths in current or past year)[edit] The 7 conflicts in the following list have caused at least 10,000 direct, violent deaths per year in battles between identified groups, in a current or past calendar year.[2] Start of conflict Conflict Continent Location Cumulative fatalities 2022 fatalities 2023 fatalities 1948 Internal conflict in Myanmar Kachin conflict Karen conflict Rohingya conflict Karen–Mon conflict Conflict in Rakhine State Myanmar civil war (2021–present) 2021 Kalay clashes Clashes in Chin State Operation 1027 Operation 1107 Operation 1111 Asia Myanmar 180,000–210,000[3][4] 2,750[5]–20,206[6][7] 12,936[6][8][9][10] 1948 Israeli–Palestinian conflict Gaza–Israel conflict 2023 Israel–Hamas war Asia Israel Palestine Egypt Lebanon Syria Iraq 40,000+[11] 194[5]–255[6][12] 14,945–15,945[5][6][a][b][c][21] 2002 Insurgency in the Maghreb Insurgency in the Sahel Jihadist insurgency in Niger Jihadist insurgency in Burkina Faso Mali War Internal conflict in Azawad Islamic State insurgency in Tunisia Africa Burkina Faso Mali Niger Benin Togo Algeria Tunisia Chad Ivory Coast Mauritania Ghana Nigeria Cameroon Morocco Libya 54,000+ 9,000[6][22][23] 12,261[6][24] 2006 Mexican drug war Infighting in the Gulf Cartel Infighting in Los Zetas North America Mexico 350,000-400,000[25][d] 7,821[6][27]–14,254[5] 6,358[6] 2014 Russo-Ukrainian War Russian invasion of Ukraine Europe Russia Ukraine 180,000–220,000+[28][29] 82,637[5]–100,000+[30] 27,352[6]–95,088+[31] 2018 Ethiopian civil conflict Afar–Somali clashes Oromo conflict OLA insurgency Eritrean intervention War in Amhara Africa Ethiopia 177,000–600,000+[32][33][34] 10,341[e][6][35][36]–109,600+[5][6][35][36][37] 3,075[6][38][39][40] 2023 War in Sudan Africa Sudan 12,014[6][41][42] 0[5] 12,014[6][41][42][43] Wars (1,000–9,999 combat-related deaths in current or past year)[edit] The 14 conflicts in the following list have caused at least 1,000 and fewer than 10,000 direct, violent deaths in a current or past calendar year.[2] Conflicts causing at least 1,000 deaths in one calendar year are considered wars by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program.[44] Start of conflict Conflict Continent Location Cumulative fatalities 2022 fatalities 2023 fatalities 1964 Colombian conflict Catatumbo campaign 2021 Apure clashes Ecuadorian security crisis Pemon conflict South America Colombia Venezuela Ecuador 453,000+[45] 282[5]–3,087[6] 2,244[6] 1978 Afghan conflict Afghanistan–Pakistan border skirmishes Islamic State–Taliban conflict Republican insurgency in Afghanistan Asia Afghanistan Pakistan 1,453,000–2,584,468+[46] 1,545[5]–3,930[6][47] 906[6] 1991 Somali Civil War Current phase Africa Somalia Kenya 350,000–500,000+[48][49] 3,115[5]–7,038[6][50] 8,509[6] 1996 Allied Democratic Forces insurgency Africa DR Congo Uganda 9,000+[51][52][53][54] 2,902[6] 1,279[6] 1998 Communal conflicts in Nigeria Religious violence in Nigeria Herder–farmer conflicts Nigerian bandit conflict Africa Nigeria 33,000+[51][55][56][57] 1,900[6]–2,877[5] 2,829[6][58] 1999 Ituri conflict Africa DR Congo 65,000+[59] 1,660[6] 740[6] 2003 Iraqi conflict Islamic State insurgency in Iraq Asia Iraq 332,000–1,215,000+[60][61][f] 855[5]–4,491[6][62] 1,151[6] 2004 Insurgency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Asia Pakistan 46,000–61,549+[63] 893[6][64] 1,070[6] 2004 Kivu conflict M23 offensive Democratic Republic of the Congo–Rwanda tensions (2022–present) Africa DR Congo Rwanda Burundi 25,000+[65] 2,438[6]–5,912[66] 2,067[6] 2008 Sudanese nomadic conflicts Ethnic violence in South Sudan Africa Sudan South Sudan 387,000–400,000+[67] 2,000[5][6][68] 1,168[6][69] 2009 Boko Haram insurgency Religious violence in Nigeria Africa Nigeria Cameroon Niger Chad 368,000[70] 6,800[6] 4,420[6][71] 2011 Syrian civil war Desert campaign Inter-rebel conflict Rojava conflict Russian intervention Syrian–Turkish border clashes Turkish intervention Israeli–Syrian ceasefire line incidents Iran–Israel conflict during the Syrian civil war U.S.-led intervention Iranian intervention Hezbollah intervention Northwestern Syria clashes Asia Syria 505,000–613,000+[72] 1,638[5]–5,639[6][73] 5,380[6][74] 2014 Yemeni civil war Al-Qaeda insurgency South Yemen insurgency Houthi–Saudi Arabian conflict Saudi Arabian-led intervention Asia Yemen Saudi Arabia United Arab Emirates 377,000[75] 3,223[5]–6,828[6][76] 3,145[6] 2020 Gang war in Haiti North America Haiti 3,700+[77][78][79] 89[80]–236[5] 1,665[6][77] Minor conflicts (100–999 combat-related deaths in current or past year)[edit] The 22 conflicts in the following list have caused at least 100, and fewer than 1,000, direct, violent deaths in a current or past calendar year.
