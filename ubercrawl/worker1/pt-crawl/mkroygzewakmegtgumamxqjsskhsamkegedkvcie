Shortcuts WP:URFA WP:FAWCP Updated 2020 list at Wikipedia:Unreviewed featured articles/2020 The following is a list of Featured articles from the first half of 2006 and prior that have not been processed at the Featured article review (FAR). The list is in two parts: The original few or no citations list. These are articles which, as of June 2006, had few or no inline citations. Generated in that month, it originally comprised 523 featured articles that had less than ten inline citations; while partly arbitrary, this was compiled under the general assumption that such articles would not meet the evolving referencing standards of the Featured article process. The initial list was created by The Disco King and was maintained by SandyGeorgia until September 2010. Other unreviewed featured articles to June 30, 2006. These articles, totalling 315 313,[1] had 10 or more citations at the time the original list was generated and thus were not included. FAR and the old Featured article removal candidates were merged in June 2006; thus this section widens the original pool of unreviewed FAs to include every article promoted prior to the "modern" review process. It was compiled by Dr pda and SandyGeorgia in September 2008, and has been maintained by DrKay and Maralia since 2010. As FAs lose status through the Featured article review process, they are to be struck through (example) on this list. See the statistics below for the total number with problems at the initial drafting of the two sections and subsequently. This list is not canonical, a policy, a "punishment" for articles, or a proxy for the regular Featured article review; it is meant to aid people in tracking featured articles that have not been reviewed, and not more than that.

Date promoted Article Notes 2005-09-24 Flag of Belarus Seems fine other than a few missing citations, which I tagged. Probably no need for an extensive review. -- Beland (talk) 01:07, 1 February 2020 (UTC)Reply[reply] 2005-12-14 Dinosaur Note August 2011 Doubled in size since FAC, mixed citation style.
