Based in Philadelphia, the AACR focuses on all aspects of cancer research, including basic, clinical, and translational research into the etiology, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. Founded in 1907 by 11 physicians and scientists, the organization now has more than 52,000 members in 130 countries and territories. The mission of the AACR is to prevent and cure cancer through research, education, communication, collaboration, science policy and advocacy, and funding for cancer research. History[edit] The AACR was founded on May 7, 1907, in Washington, D.C., as the "Association for Cancer Research" by a group of scientists consisting of four surgeons, five pathologists, and two biochemists. The founding members were Silas P. Beebe, George H. A. Clowes, William Coley, James Ewing, Harvey R. Gaylord, Robert B. Greenough, J. Collins Warren, George W. Crile, Leo Loeb, Frank Burr Mallory, and Ernest E. Tyzzer. They organized annual meetings to coincide with the meetings for the much larger meetings of the American Association of Pathologists and Bacteriologists. At the first meeting in New York City in November 1907, nine papers were presented. For the first 30 years, the group functioned as a select group of scientists, but with the expansion of cancer research in the 1930s, membership and interest grew. The society was officially incorporated in 1940.[1] Meetings and workshops[edit] Vice President Joe Biden speaking at the 2016 AACR annual meeting about the Cancer Moonshot project. Annual meeting[edit] AACR's annual meeting attracts more than 21,000 participants from around the world and has been described as the "main forum to present and discuss cancer-related research."[2] Attendees gather to discuss over 6,000 abstracts and to hear more than 250 invited presentations on significant discoveries in basic, clinical, and translational cancer research. Scientific award lectures, grant writing workshops, networking events, and educational sessions round out this comprehensive program. Conferences and educational workshops[edit] In addition to the annual meeting, the AACR organizes approximately 30 other conferences and workshops each year,[3] including: Smaller, more focused Special Conferences that are designed to share the latest advances in rapidly developing areas of cancer research; Larger International Conferences that recur on a regular basis, including collaborative programs such as the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics Conference, the International Cancer Immunotherapy Conference, and the Biennial Meeting on Advances in Malignant Lymphoma; Educational Workshops that train early-career investigators in clinical trial design, molecular biology, integrative molecular epidemiology, translational research, and related fields. Publications[edit] "CR (magazine)" redirects here. For other publications abbreviated 'CR', see CR (disambiguation). The AACR publishes ten peer-reviewed scientific journals: Blood Cancer Discovery, Cancer Discovery, Cancer Research, Clinical Cancer Research, Cancer Immunology Research, Molecular Cancer Therapeutics, Molecular Cancer Research, Cancer Prevention Research, Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention and Cancer Research Communications. The AACR also publishes Cancer Today, a magazine for cancer patients, survivors, and their families and friends, as well as an Annual Report Archived 2019-04-06 at the Wayback Machine, and CR Archived 2019-05-10 at the Wayback Machine which aims to foster collaboration between cancer survivors, patient advocates, physicians and scientists. Cancer Research[edit] Cancer Research is the second most-frequently cited cancer journal in the world.[4] Papers are peer-reviewed, and only those that meet high standards of scientific merit are accepted for publication. The journal publishes significant, original studies, reviews, and perspectives on all areas of basic, clinical, translational, epidemiological, and prevention research in cancer and the cancer-related biomedical sciences. Some of the topics include biochemistry; chemical, physical, and viral carcinogenesis and mutagenesis; clinical research including clinical trials; endocrinology; epidemiology and prevention; experimental therapeutics, molecular targets, and chemical biology; immunology and immunotherapy including biological therapy; molecular biology, pathobiology, and genetics; radiobiology and radiation oncology; cell and tumor biology; tumor microenvironment; systems biology and other emerging technologies. Cancer Discovery[edit] The AACR launched Cancer Discovery in 2011 as a selective journal for basic, translational, and clinical cancer research.[5] Cancer Discovery has become a premier journal in the field of cancer research, with a 2020 impact factor of 39.397 that is the highest among the AACR journals.[6][7] Research published in the journal includes identification of actionable genomic alterations in cancer, mechanisms of therapy resistance, clinical trials on targeted therapy, and cancer immunotherapy research including immune checkpoint blockade and Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy.[8] The AACR Foundation for the Prevention and Cure of Cancer[edit] The AACR Foundation for the Prevention and Cure of Cancer is a 501(c)(3) public charity that provides financial support for scientific research, education, and communication. The foundation funds programs deemed by the AACR to be of the highest priority and impact in promoting research, supporting scientists, and raising awareness. Eighty-eight cents of every dollar raised by the AACR Foundation directly supports cancer research. Cancer Evolution Working Group (CEWG)[edit] Following the Cancer & Evolution Symposium in October 2020, organized by Frank H. Laukien, James A. Shapiro, Denis Noble, Henry Heng and Perry Marshall, this Working Group was integrated into the AACR to facilitate an interdisciplinary approach to the study of cancer. The group now presents the monthly Cancer Evolution Seminar Series.[9][10] Presidents[edit] The names of the presidents from 1907 to 1960 were reported by Triolo in 1961.[1][11] Year Name Institution 2023 Philip Greenberg Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center 2022 Lisa Coussens Oregon Health & Science University 2021 David Tuveson Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory 2020 Antoni Ribas David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA 2019 Elaine R.
