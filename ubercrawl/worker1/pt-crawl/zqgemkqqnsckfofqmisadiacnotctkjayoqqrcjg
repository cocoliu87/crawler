The Third Front, known as Tamazuj, is a rebel group based in the Darfur and Kordofan regions of Sudan. History[edit] The word Tamazuj has been translated from a South Sudanese Arabic word meaning "blend".[1][2] Tamazuj was one of the signatories to the Juba Peace Agreement signed in October 2020.[3] In 2021, they won two seats in the legislative council, including the head of a parliamentary committee and a commission.[4] On August 17, 2023, Tamazuj declared its formal alliance with the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the ongoing conflict against the Sudanese Armed Forces.[5] Recently, on March 12, 2023, Tamazuj stormed a police station in Khartoum, believing the security forces there assaulted one of their leaders. According to Tamazuj, a group of police officers severely beat the general and broke his leg. In retaliation, the group surrounded the station using one armed and eight small vehicles while firing air guns. According to the Sudan Tribune, Tamazuj has more than agreed troops in Khartoum. The incident is part of a wave of similar occurrences in the capital.[6] References[edit] ^ "Radio Tamazuj". SoundCloud. Archived from the original on 2021-05-05.
