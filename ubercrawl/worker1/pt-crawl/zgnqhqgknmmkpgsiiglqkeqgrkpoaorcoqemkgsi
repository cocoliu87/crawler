November was the ninth month of the calendar of Romulus c. 750 BC. November retained its name (from the Latin novem meaning "nine") when January and February were added to the Roman calendar. November is a month of late spring in the Southern Hemisphere and late autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, November in the Southern Hemisphere is the seasonal equivalent of May in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa. In Ancient Rome, Ludi Plebeii was held from November 4–17, Epulum Jovis was held on November 13 and Brumalia celebrations began on November 24. These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar. November was referred to as Blōtmōnaþ by the Anglo-Saxons. Brumaire and Frimaire were the months on which November fell in the French Republican calendar.

The Orionids, which occurs in late October, sometimes lasts into November. Astrology[edit] The Western zodiac signs for November are Scorpio (October 23 – November 21) and Sagittarius (November 22 – December 21).[1][2] Symbols[edit] Chrysanthemum Topaz crystal Citrine gemstone November's birthstone is the topaz (particularly, yellow) which symbolizes friendship and the citrine.
