July 30 STS-114: NASA announces that the mission will be extended for one day, so that Discovery's crew can assist the Expedition 11 crew in maintenance tasks on-board the International Space Station. --Kitch 23:07, 30 July 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Maybe we should hold off on another Shuttle story till it lands. The announcement that the mission will be extended one day is not really unusual at all.--Pharos 23:49, 30 July 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] I agree. There is enough going on on planet earth without a day by day account of the trials and tribulations of an American space shuttle. FearÉIREANN\(caint) 00:55, 31 July 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] I just wanted to note... shouldn't we mention that the 21 July 2005 London bombings suspects were captured in Rome? --Kitch 20:25, 30 July 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Well, one was captured in Birmingham, two in London, and one in Rome. It would be a mouthful to put all that on ITN.--Pharos 23:47, 30 July 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] July 29 Map showing Maharashtra (purple) in India.

Depending on albedo, 2003 EL61 potentially has twice the radius of Pluto. Thue | talk 15:41, 29 July 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Added, see if you can find a graphic (the one the BBC has might work). --Dante Alighieri | Talk 18:08, July 29, 2005 (UTC) July 28 Let's use for the blurb about Northern Ireland on ITN right now, shall we ? The current image doesn't go with the top news item. -- 199.71.174.100 01:21, 29 July 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Possibly one of these murals from Commons would be better. In particular a central crop from Image:Derry_mural_9.jpg. These are of course politically loaded, so care needs to be taken. -- Solipsist 10:04, 29 July 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] The detail from the wide wall of murals doesn't work, but this one might.

There have been several other spaceflights since then (e.g. Soyuz TMA-5 in October 2004). Ben Arnold 16:36, 26 July 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] I've found a whole bunch of other spaceflights since Columbia: 26 April 2003 Soyuz TMA-2 15 October 2003 Shenzhou 5 18 October 2003 Soyuz TMA-3 19 April 2004 Soyuz TMA-4 14 October 2004 Soyuz TMA-5 15 April 2005 Soyuz TMA-6 It's frustrating that false information has been put in the News section and the page is protected. Ben Arnold 16:51, 26 July 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Can we have "... the first U.S. spaceflight since ..." changed to "... the first NASA spaceflight since ...", please ? -- 64.229.206.3 18:00, 26 July 2005 (UTC) And I don't think we need a hyphen in "lifts-off". -- 64.229.32.127 18:52, 26 July 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] July 25 Prime Minister Helen Clark of New Zealand calls a general election for September 17. -- 199.71.174.100 01:19, 26 July 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] The setting of a date for the election is not of sufficient importance for ITN. Maybe it would be if it was a snap election, but this is one of the most expected dates. We should certainly have the election itself here on September 17, and the results on September 18.-gadfium 03:18, 26 July 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] I agree that it's not a surprise, but we haven't had much from that part of the world lately. Let's not leave them out. This was apparently the top news item there yesterday, as it is now on the ITN at Wikipedia:Wikiportal/New Zealand. Also, I would suggest an update of ITN with something for the sake of an update. I'd rather have the earthquake, or the Philippine electoral crisis, 2005, but we need well updated articles. An alternative would be the Guinea-Bissau presidential election, 2005, but I'd wait for the pending results in a few days. This suggestion was made in response to a complaint at Talk:Main Page#Update the news section regularly. Please re-consider. Thanks. -- 199.71.174.100 04:56, 26 July 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Yeah, it's updated with something! -- 199.71.174.100 21:45, 26 July 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] July 24 Lance Armstrong, 2004 2005 Tour de France: Lance Armstrong of the Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team wins his 7th consecutive Tour de France and plans to retire from bicycle racing. -- 199.71.174.100 18:41, 24 July 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Thanks, Solipsist, for posting. -- 199.71.174.100 20:30, 24 July 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] The bicycle racing wiki should be bicycle racing (actually referencing road bicycle racing), since plain bicycle racing is a disambiguation page of sorts, and in the context of Lance Armstrong, road bicycle racing is the meaning intended. --Serge 17:46, 26 July 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Is Lance moving on to other (non-road) bicycle racing ? -- 64.229.32.127 18:55, 26 July 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] July 22 A plane crashed close to the German parliament (Bundestag) and Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's office. See http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/sns-ap-germany-plane-crash,1,7523308.story?coll=chi-news-hed&ctrack=1&cset=true The current In the News says "following yesterday's abortive bombing attempts..." Didn't the bombs actually go off? (ie they were not attempts, nor abortive). The section should read "following yesterday's bombings on the London Underground..." Kaisershatner 18:18, 22 July 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Only the detonators, not the devices themselves, exploded with the bombers then fleeing the scene. I think that qualifies as an abortive attempt.

Sorry. I've fixed the articles, but I need a sysop to fix the MainPage, please. -- 64.229.206.159 13:13, 18 July 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Done. Morwen - Talk 13:19, 18 July 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] The English language edition of the Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is released first at midnight local time across the UK, Ireland and North America. International releases follow later on the same day. pamri 04:41, July 16, 2005 (UTC) July 14 Time to do a Karl Rove story. The latest news [1] is that an undisclosed New York times source claims that Rove admitted to investigators to have talked to columnist Robert Novak, shortly before Novak publicized the name of Valerie Plame. In the past weeks, it was revealed that Rove told Times reporter Matthew Cooper that "Wilson's wife" was a CIA agent, but until today it was not clear if Rove had ever talked directly to Novak. The report, if confirmed will substantiate both the claims of Rove's misconduct, accidental or deliberate, and further implicate the White House and perhaps even its appointed investigator. -SV|t 01:28, 16 July 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] This is a U.S. story with somewhat limited international interest, so we probably wouldn't want to put it up more than once. I think it might be best to wait a few days on this one, as events are movingly rapidly and it seems likely there will be at least some sort of a "confession" (if not resignation) on Rove's part soon.--Pharos 02:02, 16 July 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] July 13 The National Hockey League labor dispute, the longest work stoppage in North American professional sports, ends after 301 days. We have too much room on the right side of the Main Page, how about sticking this in somewhere on ITN ? -- 199.71.174.100 06:50, 15 July 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] Thanks for posting so quickly, Golbez. -- 199.71.174.100 07:42, 15 July 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] While I do enjoy hockey, and this is important, what with everything it affects, they still have not officialy ended the lockout. After its ratified would be a better time to announce it, which should happen sometime next week.
