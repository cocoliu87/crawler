Domestic cricket[edit] The 1900–01 season was notable for Clem Hill's career-high 365* which enabled South Australia to defeat New South Wales by an innings. Hill went on to be the season's leading runscorer with 620 @ 103.33. The leading wicket-takers with 20 apiece were Jack Saunders @ 17.13 (BB 6/70) and Joe Travers @ 20.75 (BB 9/30). When South Africa toured in 1910–11, Australia relied on the outstanding bowling of Bill Whitty who was the season's leading wicket-taker with 70 wickets @ 20.27 (BB 6/17). The top runscorer was Aubrey Faulkner of South Africa with 1534 runs @ 59.00 (HS 204); the leading home batsman was Victor Trumper with 1246 @ 69.22 (HS 214*). The 1914–15 season was the last to be played before the First World War ended first-class cricket in Australia until December 1918. Jack Ryder, whose best years were after the war, was the leading runscorer in 1914–15 with 445 runs @ 74.16 (HS 151). The leading bowler was Bert Ironmonger with 36 wickets @ 17.52 (BB 7/69).
