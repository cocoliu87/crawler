The club is based in the neighbourhood of Laranjeiras since its foundation, in 1902. Fluminense is the oldest football club in Rio de Janeiro. The club was founded on 21 July 1902 and Oscar Cox was its first elected president.[2] Fluminense have since been crowned national champions four times, most recently in the 2012 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A; the team have also won the 2007 Copa do Brasil and the 1952 Intercontinental Cup. In 1949, Fluminense became the first football club in the world to receive the Olympic Cup, awarded annually by the International Olympic Committee to an institution or association with a record of merit and integrity in actively developing the Olympic Movement. Its best international performances are finishing champions of the 2023 Copa Libertadores. Fluminense is a demonym for people indigenous to the state of Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil. Fluminense's traditional home kit consists of an iconic combination of three colors: garnet, white and green, disposal in vertical stripes, since its adoption, in 1904. Along with white shorts and white socks, an outfit which has been in use since 1920, that's the typical home kit for the Tricolor. The club holds several long-standing rivalries with other clubs, most notably with Flamengo (Clássico Fla-Flu), as well as with Botafogo (Clássico Vovô) and Vasco da Gama (Clássico dos Gigantes). The Clássico Fla-Flu is widely considered the greatest football derby of Brazil, and host several attendance records, as the two highest attended matches in any football club tier, with almost 200.000 supporters in Maracanã. The club is the birthplace of the Brazil national football team, which played its first game midst the celebrations of the 12th anniversary of the club. In Fluminense's ground, the Stadium of Laranjeiras, the Canarinhos held their first ever match, scored their first ever goal and lifted their first ever trophy. Until today, the club has contributed the fifth-most players to the national team among all Brazilian clubs.[3] History[edit] Fluminense Football Club was founded on 21 July 1902 in the neighbourhood of Laranjeiras in the city of Rio de Janeiro by a group of young football enthusiasts led by Oscar Cox, a Brazilian of English descent who had come into contact with the sport whilst studying in Europe.[4] Oscar Cox, founder of Fluminense The first official match was played against now defunct Rio Football Club, and Fluminense won 8–0.[5] The club's first title came in 1906, when Fluminense won the Campeonato Carioca.[5] In 1911, disagreement between Fluminense players led to the formation of Flamengo's football team.[5] The so-called Fla-Flu derby is considered one of the biggest in the history of Brazilian football.[6] Three years later, in Fluminense's stadium, the Brazil national football team debuted, against touring English club Exeter City.[5] It was also there that they won their debut title, in 1919.[7] By 1922, Fluminense had 4,000 members, a stadium for 25,000 people, and facilities that impressed clubs in Europe.[8] The team that won its first Campeonato Carioca, in 1906 Preguinho, a notable Fluminense player The following years saw an expansion of the club's hegemony in Rio. Fluminense would remain unsurpassed in terms of state championships until 2009.[9] International acclaim came in 1949 with the awarding of the Olympic Cup, and was further fostered in 1952 with Fluminense's World-wide honour, the Copa Rio. The club established itself regionally with victory in two Torneio Rio-São Paulo cups in 1957 and 1960.[5] National honors followed in 1970, 1984, 2010 and 2012 with Taça de Prata and Série A cups, respectively,[5] also taking the Cup in Brazil in 2007 and the Brasileirão Série C in 1999. From the 1950s, with the creation of the Rio-São Paulo Tournament, the forerunner of what eventually would become the national championship, Fluminense established itself regionally by winning the tournament title in the years of 1957 and 1960. The Fluminense team in 1960 From the 1960s, the first national championships began to be played in Brazil. Fluminense's first national title came in 1970; at that time, Brazil had the best players in world football, and all of them played in Brazilian clubs. Although its squad was not counted among the main contenders of the season in Brazil, Fluminense won the Brazilian championship and surpassed the great strengths of the time in Santos, Palmeiras and Cruzeiro. Stained glass windows in Fluminense's headquarters In the 1970s, Fluminense signed several famous players like Rivellino. This time, called "Maquina Tricolor", they won the state championship in the years of 1975 and 1976. In the national championship, Fluminense lost in the semifinal matches to Internacional in 1975 and Corinthians in 1976. Fluminense again became Brazilian champions in 1984. This time, they won the State Championship in the years of 1983, 1984, and 1985 with players like Romerito, Ricardo Gomes, Deley, and the "Casal Vinte": Assis and Washington. At the end of the 1980s, Copa do Brasil was created, inspired by the Cup tournaments played in European countries. Fluminense reached the final of the Copa do Brasil for the first time in 1992, but lost to Internacional de Porto Alegre. A disastrous campaign led to Fluminense's relegation from Brasileirão Série A in 1996. However, a set of off-field political manoeuvres not performed by the club allowed them to remain in Brazil's top domestic league,[10] only to be relegated the next year.[11] Completely out of control, the club was relegated from Série B to Série C in 1998.[12] In 1999, Fluminense won the Série C championship and were to be promoted to Série B when they were invited to take part in Copa João Havelange,[13] a championship that replaced the traditional Série A in 2000. In 2001, it was decided that all clubs which took part in Copa João Havelange's so-called Blue Group should be kept in Série A.[14] In 2002, 2005 and 2012, Fluminense won the Campeonato Carioca again. In 2005, Fluminense reached the final of the Copa do Brasil again, but lost to Paulista Futebol Clube. In 2007, Fluminense won the Copa do Brasil after beating Figueirense in the final, and was admitted to the Copa Libertadores again after 23 years.[5][15] The club's campaign saw them reach the final and included remarkable matches against Arsenal de Sarandí, São Paulo and the Boca Juniors.[16][17][18] Fluminense lost the final to LDU Quito in a penalty shootout.[19] After signing 27 players and going through 5 different managers in 2009, Fluminense found themselves struggling to avoid another relegation from Série A.[20] With less than one-third of the championship left, the mathematical probability of the club's relegation was 98%.[21] At this point, manager Cuca decided to dispense with some of the more experienced players and gave Fluminense's youngsters a chance.[22] That, along with Fred's recovery from a serious injury and substantial support from the fans, allowed not only a sensational escape from relegation, but also placed Fluminense in the final of the Copa Sudamericana.[23][24] For the second year in a row, the club contested a continental cup. In a repeat of the previous year's Copa Libertadores, Fluminense lost the final to LDU Quito.[25] Washington Cerqueira before playing the 2008 Copa Libertadores final match In 2010, Fluminense won the Brazilian championship for the third time in their history, marking their third national championship after 1970 and 1984. It was also the fourth title for coach Muricy Ramalho in a decade: Ramalho had won the title three times in a row with São Paulo from 2006 to 2008. Darío Conca was named the Brazilian Championship's Player of the Season, while Fred and Washington were decisive players in Fluminense's winning campaign. On 23 May 2012, Fluminense lost the semifinal qualification match to Boca Juniors from Argentina, for the continental club football cup, Copa Libertadores.[26] Later that year, on 11 November, they won their fourth Brazilian championship after defeating the near-relegated Palmeiras 3–2.[27] Fluminense won the Série A for the fourth time on 11 November 2012.[28] In December 2013, a draw with Bahia in the last round of the 2013 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A had Fluminense mathematically relegated to Série B. However, rule-breaking lineups by Portuguesa and Fluminense's main rivals Flamengo in their matches against Grêmio and Cruzeiro respectively caused Portuguesa and Flamengo to lose 4 points after a trial in STJD (Brazil's governing football jury). The points lost by Flamengo and Portuguesa allowed Fluminense to stay in Série A, with Portuguesa being relegated and Flamengo ending the championship as the lowest-ranked non-relegated club.
