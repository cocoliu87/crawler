Ibrahim Abboud Coup Military Leader Ahmad Abd al-Wahab The 1958 Sudanese coup d'état was a bloodless military coup which took place in Sudan on 17 November 1958.[1] The coup was effectively a self-coup, orchestrated by Prime Minister Abdallah Khalil (in office since 1956), against the civilian government formed following the 1958 parliamentary election. The government was a coalition between Khalil's National Umma Party (NUP) and the People's Democratic Party (PDP).[2][3] Khalil simultaneously served as Minister of Defence in the government. The United States and the United Kingdom were aware of the plot.[4] The coup occurred on the day parliament was to convene. Khalil, himself a retired army general, planned the coup in conjunction with leading NUP members and the army's two senior generals, Ibrahim Abboud and Ahmad Abd al-Wahab, who became leaders of the new military regime. Khalil was not allowed to participate in the new government and was retired on a pension.[5] See also[edit] History of Sudan#Independent Sudan (1956 to present) References[edit] ^ Hailey, Foster (November 18, 1958).
