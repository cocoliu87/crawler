Eddings also suggested that Australia could host the event in October 2021, and India stage the tournament a year later in 2022. The ICC also considered moving the tournament to be played around the next Women's ODI World Cup, which was originally scheduled to take place in New Zealand for February 2021.[32] A month before the official postponement, Australian federal tourism minister Simon Birmingham announced that the Australian government expected that the country's borders would be closed to international travel until 2021.[33] The ICC also confirmed that either Australia or India, the hosts for the tournaments originally scheduled to take place in 2020 and 2021 respectively, would host this tournament.[34][35] In August 2020, the ICC confirmed that India are expected to host the 2021 tournament, with Australia expected to the 2022 tournament.[36] In the same month, the ICC confirmed that Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates were being considered as back-up venues for the tournament.[37] In April 2021, the ICC's CEO Geoff Allardice confirmed that back-up plans were still in place if India were unable to host the tournament due to the pandemic.[38] Later the same month, Dhiraj Malhotra of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) confirmed that the UAE would be used as a contingency,[39] if the pandemic in India continued to get worse.[40] The BCCI were also in talks with Oman as a potential co-host of the tournament.[41] On 1 June 2021, the ICC gave the BCCI the deadline of 28 June 2021 to make its decision on where the tournament would be played.[42] Regardless of the actual location of the tournament, the ICC also confirmed that the BCCI would remain as the hosts of the competition.[43] Later, the ICC confirmed that the tournament had been moved to the UAE and Oman.[5] It was the first time for both the UAE and Oman to be hosting a global ICC event, and also the first occasion that a cricket World Cup was being held entirely outside of the Test-playing nations.[44] Less than two weeks before the start of the tournament, Oman was impacted by Cyclone Shaheen which passed only a few miles north of the tournament venue in Al-Amerat. Pankaj Khimji, chairman of Oman Cricket, stated that "we were so close to being virtually wiped out [...] had this had happened over here in this area, I'd have said goodbye to the World Cup".[45] Teams and qualification[edit] Main article: 2019 ICC Men's T20 World Cup Qualifier As of 31 December 2018, the top nine ranked ICC Full Members, alongside hosts India, qualified directly for the 2021 tournament.[46][47] Of those ten teams, the top eight ranked sides qualified for the Super 12s stage of the tournament.[46] Sri Lanka and Bangladesh did not qualify for the Super 12s, instead being placed in the group stage of the competition.[46] They were joined by the six teams who had qualified for the tournament via the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier.[46] Of the teams in the ICC Men's T20I Team Rankings, the United Arab Emirates and Nepal could only qualify through regional competitions.[11] The top four teams from the group stage advanced to the Super 12s.[46] Papua New Guinea were the first team to secure their position via the Qualifier, after they won Group A of the tournament, finishing above the Netherlands on net run rate.[48] It was the first time that Papua New Guinea had qualified for a World Cup in any format.[49] Ireland became the second team to qualify via this route after they won Group B, also on net run rate.[50] In the first match in the playoffs, the Netherlands qualified for the T20 World Cup when they beat the United Arab Emirates by eight wickets, after the UAE only scored 80 runs in their innings.[51] The second qualifier match saw Namibia advance to their first T20 World Cup after beating Oman by 54 runs.[52] Scotland beat tournament hosts the United Arab Emirates in the third qualifier by 90 runs to secure their place in the T20 World Cup.[53] Oman became the final team to qualify for the T20 World Cup, when they beat Hong Kong by 12 runs in the last playoff match.[54] In August 2021, concerns and doubts were raised over the participation of Afghanistan cricket team in the tournament ever since Afghanistan was brought under the control of the Taliban.[55] Afghanistan's team media manager Hikmat Hassan confirmed that Afghanistan would play in the T20 World Cup, despite the political turmoil in the country.[56] On 6 October 2021, the Afghanistan team left Kabul, travelling to Doha, Qatar, for a training camp before the start of the tournament.[57] Means of qualification Date Venue Berths Qualified Host nation 7 August 2020 (originally awarded on 10 February 2015) 1 India[a] ICC Men's T20I Team Rankings (Top 9 teams in rankings who played in the last WT20, excluding the hosts)[46] 31 December 2018 Various 9 Pakistan Australia England South Africa New Zealand West Indies Afghanistan Sri Lanka Bangladesh 2019 ICC Men's T20 World Cup Qualifier 18 October–3 November 2019 UAE 6 Netherlands Papua New Guinea Ireland Namibia Scotland Oman[b] Total 16 Match officials[edit] On 7 October 2021, the ICC named the match referees and the on-field umpires for the tournament.[58][59] For the Super 12 match between India and New Zealand, umpire Michael Gough was replaced by Marais Erasmus after Gough was suspended for six days for breaching the tournament's bio-secure bubble.[60] On 3 November 2021, the ICC confirmed that Gough would not officiate in any further matches in the tournament.[61] On 9 November 2021, the match officials were confirmed for the semi-final matches,[62] with the officials for the final being confirmed on 12 November 2021.[63] Match referees David Boon Jeff Crowe Ranjan Madugalle Javagal Srinath Umpires Chris Brown Aleem Dar Kumar Dharmasena Marais Erasmus Chris Gaffaney Michael Gough Adrian Holdstock Richard Illingworth Richard Kettleborough Nitin Menon Ahsan Raza Paul Reiffel Langton Rusere Rod Tucker Joel Wilson Paul Wilson Squads[edit] Main article: 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup squads Each team selected a squad of 15 players before 10 October 2021.[64] Each team was also able to select up to seven additional players, if needed, with regards to COVID-19.[65] On 10 August 2021, New Zealand were the first team to announce their squad for the tournament.[66] All the teams announced their preliminary squads by 12 September 2021.[67] Schedule and broadcasting[edit] With a total of 45 matches, the T20 World Cup was composed of two rounds.
