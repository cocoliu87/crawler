October 30 At least 80 militants are killed by Pakistani forces in an air strike on a religious school.

Aecis Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984. 00:04, 31 October 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] I suspect 68.217.193.20 was only suggesting the use of the DRC flag. --65.95.105.59 14:16, 1 November 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] October 29 Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva We have a winner in the Brazilian election. Can we have Lula's picture (right) on ITN, please ? -- 199.71.174.100 01:32, 30 October 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Second.

Pretty notable, but we can't have redlinks on the main page.--HamedogTalk|@ 14:26, 29 October 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] I've created an article about the company, so no red-links now Snailwalker | talk 14:37, 29 October 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] There already is an article on the Aviation Development Company. So it should be: Flight 53 from Nigerian airline company Aviation Development Company crashes shortly after taking off from Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Nigeria killing more than 100 passengers on board.----TheTallOne 16:20, 29 October 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] This is the headline I added: "Aviation Development Company Flight 53 crashes shortly after taking off from Abuja Airport in Nigeria killing more than 100 passengers, including Mohammadu Maccido, the Sultan of Sokoto." Nishkid64 19:37, 29 October 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Fixed headline again: "ADC Flight 53 crashes shortly after taking off from Abuja International Airport in Nigeria, killing more than 100 passengers, including Mohammadu Maccido, the Sultan of Sokoto." Nishkid64 19:42, 29 October 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Another presidential run off today: incumbent Georgi Parvanov vs Volen Siderov in Bulgaria. (BBC) Exit poll results say around 80% vs 20%, but we should wait until more official results before proclaiming Parvanov the winner. For now only including a line about the run off itself would be sufficient. Todor→Bozhinov 16:57, 29 October 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] That would mean three runoffs on ITN. I think that's a bit too much. I suggest merging all three runoffs of today into one: "Runoffs for the presidential elections are held in Brazil (Lula versus Alckmin), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Kabila vs. Bemba) and Bulgaria (Parvanov vs. Siderov)." Aecis Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984. 17:21, 29 October 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Sounds reasonable. Not to mention the two already on the Main Page have the same wording. Now, we can already say Parvanov is the winner according to exit poll data: "According to exit poll data, Georgi Parvanov is decisively reelected President of Bulgaria in a run off caused by low turnout." (BBC) Todor→Bozhinov 18:05, 29 October 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Both Georgi Parvanov and Bulgarian presidential election, 2006 have been updated, so I'm just waiting for an admin to add it now. Todor→Bozhinov 19:41, 29 October 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Bulgarian presidential election, 2006#Second round still needs to be updated. Aecis Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984. 20:41, 29 October 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Of course, we can include exit poll or preliminary data in the table, but I was waiting for the 100% official and exact results to fill it up, as the closest we have at the moment are as of 73.17% of records processed. If we really need to have the table filled up, I'd add the data from Izbori2006.org, but I'm not sure this would be of use, as it's only temporary.

Bush signs into the law to build fence at US-Mexico border. -- Shyam (T/C) 17:36, 27 October 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Yes, I consider it to be notable and it has an adequete article on WikiNews but neither article on Wikipedia (United States-Mexico border or The Secure Fence Act of 2006) have in depth information on this subject. It requires work to appear on ITN. --TheTallOne 19:49, 27 October 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] The St. Louis Cardinals win their first MLB title since 1982, defeating Detroit 4 games to 1 in the 2006 World Series. --ChicosBailBonds 03:57, 28 October 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Already added.

I know that Wikipedia is not censored, but is it the most sensible thing to have one of the first links on the Front Page being to an article whose first words, bolded, are "Cunt: The Movie"? Batmanand | Talk 07:57, 25 October 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Definitely not notable enough. Bordering on tabloid journalism and no international significance. --AMorris (talk)●(contribs) 08:16, 25 October 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] The Supreme Court of New Jersey gives the state legislature six months to rewrite marriage laws that will either create same-sex civil unions or legalize homosexual marriage. http://apnews.myway.com/article/20061025/D8KVS3P00.html - Schrandit 07:42, 26 October 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Is there an updated story on the current events page about this verdict or about this case? If so, I endorse putting this up. Aecis Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984. 10:07, 26 October 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] I've found two relevant updated articles, Lewis v.

Real-Time counting of votes(Reuters) I think this is an important story given the role of the Panama Canal in world trade Radioheadhst 23:16, 22 October 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] I agree with putting this up, but only when the results are final. The wording would be something like: "Panama approves/disapproves of a plan to expand the Panama Canal. The cost of the expansion is estimated at over 5 billion US dollars."

Not only has the United States declared that it has rights in space, but, if necessary, it will deny its adversaries access to space. This is a dramatic change in US attitude to space from being primarily are research area, it is now becomeing part of the defence program. This is a matter of World importance, is it not? This, relatively unreported, change in US policy is a turning point, an historic moment, when the US laid claim to sovereignty over space and announced its intention to defend its space assets from possible threats from other countries and to to deny access to space by its adversaries. Certainly a moment to be recorded in an Enclycolpedia!
