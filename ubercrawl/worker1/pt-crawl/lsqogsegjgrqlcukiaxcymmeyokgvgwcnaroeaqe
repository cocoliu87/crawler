For the women's format, see Women's Twenty20 International. A Twenty20 International between England and Sri Lanka in June 2006 at The Rose Bowl (Southampton). A Twenty20 International (T20I) is a form of cricket, played between international members of the International Cricket Council (ICC), where each team faces a maximum of twenty overs. These matches hold top-class status and are the highest T20 standard. The game is played under the rules of Twenty20 cricket. Starting from the format's inception in 2005, T20I status only applied to Full Members and some Associate Member teams. However, in April 2018, the ICC announced that it would grant T20I status to all its 105 members from 1 January 2019. The shortened format was initially introduced to bolster crowds for the domestic game, and was not intended to be played internationally, but the first Twenty20 International took place on 17 February 2005 when Australia defeated New Zealand, and the first tournament was played two years later, with the introduction of the ICC T20 World Cup. In 2016, for the first time in a calendar year, more Twenty20 International matches (100) were played than ODI matches (99).[1] As of November 2021, 90 nations feature in ICC T20I team rankings.[2] Twenty20 International format also sees one mandatory powerplay taken in the first six overs. This shorter format of the game makes reaching the traditional milestones of scoring a century or taking five wickets in an innings more difficult, and few players have achieved these. The highest individual score in a Twenty20 International is 172, made by Australia's Aaron Finch against Zimbabwe in 2018, while Nigeria's Peter Aho has the best bowling figures of 6/5 against Sierra Leone in October 2021.

A set of laws were drawn up in 1744, and the game achieved a level of relative standardisation by the late nineteenth century.[3] One-day cricket was trialled in 1962, and the first domestic tournament played the following year,[4] and in 1971, England and Australia contested the first One Day International. The match consisted of one innings for each side, with 40 eight-ball overs.[5] In the 1990s, a number of countries were exploring the possibility of a shorter game still: in New Zealand, Martin Crowe developed Cricket Max, in which each team bats for 10 eight-ball overs,[6] while in Australia they considered an eight-a-side contest they dubbed "Super 8s". At the same time, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) conducted consumer research, and proposed the idea of a 20 overs-per-side contest, which would last for about three hours.[7] The first match was played in 2003 between Hampshire and Sussex.[citation needed] History[edit] The first Twenty20 International match between two men's sides was played on 17 February 2005, involving Australia and New Zealand. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack reported that "neither side took the game especially seriously",[8] and it was noted by ESPNcricinfo that but for a large score for Ricky Ponting, "the concept would have shuddered".[9] However, Ponting himself said "if it does become an international game then I'm sure the novelty won't be there all the time".[10] Two further matches were played that year; England beat Australia in June, and South Africa were defeated by New Zealand in October.[11] Early the following year, a contest between New Zealand and the West Indies finished as the first tied match, and a tiebreak was played for the first time in men's international cricket: the two sides took part in a bowl-out to determine a winner; New Zealand won 3–0.[12] The game had initially been developed to boost the interest in domestic cricket, and to aid this the international teams were only allowed to host three T20Is each year. The cricket manager for the ICC, David Richardson, also commented that "Part of the success of Twenty20 cricket is making sure it can coexist with Test cricket and one-dayers."[13] Despite this, the first international tournament was held in 2007 in South Africa; the 2007 ICC World Twenty20.[13] That tournament was won by India, who defeated their close rivals Pakistan in the final. Writing for The Guardian, Dilip Premachandran suggested that the competition's success meant that "the format is here to stay".[14] The next tournament was scheduled for 2009, and it was decided that they would take place biannually (more frequently than the 50 over Cricket World Cup, which occurs once every four years).[15] In the opening match of the 2007 World Twenty20, Chris Gayle scored the first century in a T20I, the achievement being reached in the twentieth match of the format.[16] The 500th T20I match was contested between Ireland and the United Arab Emirates at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium, Abu Dhabi on 16 February 2016.[17] ICC decided to use Umpire Decision Review System (DRS) in Twenty20 Internationals from the end of September 2017,[18][19] with its first use in the India-Australia T20I series in October 2017.[20] Current international rankings[edit] Current ICC members by membership status: Full members (12) Associate members with ODI status (8) Associate members (85) Former members (4) Non-members ICC Men's T20I Team Rankings v t e Rank Team Matches Points Rating 1 India 61 16,137 265 2 England 43 11,133 259 3 New Zealand 53 13,534 255 4 Australia 34 8,584 252 5 Pakistan 53 13,325 251 6 South Africa 35 8,679 248 7 West Indies 39 9,463 243 8 Sri Lanka 38 8,940 235 9 Bangladesh 44 9,943 226 10 Afghanistan 31 6,852 221 11 Zimbabwe 41 7,990 195 12 Namibia 22 4,261 194 13 Ireland 44 8,487 193 14 Scotland 18 3,412 190 15 Nepal 24 4,387 182 16 Netherlands 19 3,445 181 17 United Arab Emirates 33 5,721 173 18 Oman 21 3,054 145 19 Papua New Guinea 22 3,173 144 20 Canada 18 2,528 140 21 Hong Kong 27 3,167 134 22 United States 9 1,183 131 23 Uganda 54 7,043 130 24 Jersey 19 2,427 128 25 Malaysia 40 4,997 125 26 Kuwait 27 3,198 118 27 Bahrain 34 3,805 112 28 Qatar 18 1,964 109 29 Bermuda 14 1,494 107 30 Kenya 30 3,137 105 31 Italy 43 1,712 100 32 Tanzania 43 4,286 100 33 Saudi Arabia 20 1,992 100 34 Spain 18 1,649 92 35 Germany 33 3,022 92 36 Singapore 27 2,140 79 37 Guernsey 16 1,212 76 38 Nigeria 25 1,860 74 39 Portugal 16 1,167 73 40 Cayman Islands 11 790 72 41 Denmark 23 1,622 71 42 Belgium 18 1,237 69 43 Isle of Man 15 949 63 44 Austria 29 1,682 58 45 Norway 15 852 57 46 Vanuatu 15 846 56 47 Botswana 24 1,300 54 48 Finland 18 953 53 49 Switzerland 16 835 52 50 Japan 14 768 51 51 Malawi 14 682 49 52 Czech Republic 24 1,101 46 53 France 16 730 46 54 Sweden 18 759 42 55 Romania 28 1,149 41 56 Cook Islands 6 245 41 57 Argentina 11 424 39 58 Indonesia 10 372 37 59 Mozambique 21 759 36 60 Malta 44 1,535 35 61 Ghana 26 830 32 62 Rwanda 60 1,903 31 63 Fiji 10 304 30 64 Bhutan 11 325 30 65 Luxembourg 30 845 28 66 Cyprus 8 206 26 67 Philippines 8 281 26 68 Sierra Leone 11 545 25 69 Bahamas 10 241 24 70 Belize 3 66 22 71 Hungary 19 367 19 72 Panama 11 206 19 73 Thailand 14 205 15 74 Serbia 19 214 14 75 Gibraltar 30 385 13 76 Bulgaria 30 289 10 77 Lesotho 9 82 9 78 Gambia 7 50 7 79 Estonia 11 60 5 80 Turkey 7 26 4 81 Maldives 16 44 3 82 Croatia 10 0 0 83 Greece 6 0 0 84 Samoa 9 0 0 85 Seychelles 7 0 0 86 Eswatini 18 0 0 87 Cameroon 11 0 0 References: ICC T20I rankings, As of 3 November 2023 "Matches" is the number of matches played in the 12–24 months since the May before last, plus half the number in the 24 months before that. Teams with T20I status[edit] Permanent T20I status[edit] Prior to 2019, permanent T20I status was limited to the Test-playing nations (the full members of the ICC), which included 12 teams after the promotion of Afghanistan and Ireland to full member status in 2017. In April 2018, the ICC announced that it would grant T20I status to all of its 105 members from 1 January 2019.[21][22][23] Nations that have played T20I cricket are listed below, with the date of their first T20I after gaining permanent T20I status shown in brackets (some of these nations had previously played T20Is with temporary status): Australia (17 February 2005) New Zealand (17 February 2005) England (13 June 2005) South Africa (21 October 2005) West Indies (16 February 2006) Sri Lanka (15 June 2006) Pakistan (28 August 2006) Bangladesh (28 November 2006) Zimbabwe (28 November 2006) India (1 December 2006) Afghanistan (5 February 2018) Ireland (12 June 2018) Bahrain (20 January 2019) Kuwait (20 January 2019) Maldives (20 January 2019) Saudi Arabia (20 January 2019) Qatar (21 January 2019)  contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 56 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Twenty20_International responseCode 3 200
