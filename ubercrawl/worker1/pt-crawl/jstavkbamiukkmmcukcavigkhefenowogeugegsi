The name Synthese (from the Dutch for synthesis) finds its origin in the intentions of its founding editors: making explicit the supposed internal coherence between the different, highly specialised scientific disciplines.[4] Jaakko Hintikka was the editor-in-chief of Synthese from 1965 to 2002.[5] The current editors-in-chief are Otávio Bueno, Wiebe van der Hoek, and Kristie Miller.[6] Editorial decision controversies[edit] In 2011, Synthese became involved in a controversy over intelligent design. The printed version of the special issue Evolution and Its Rivals[7] of the journal, which appeared two years after the online version, was supplied with a disclaimer from the then editors of the journal that "appeared to undermine [the authors] and the guest editors".[8] Synthese engendered controversy again in 2016, when an article printed in it was called a "homophobic and sexist rant".[9] "Due to an unfortunate human error", one of the articles accepted to the special issue Logic and Relativity Theory[10] of the journal was not sent by the guest editor to the editors of the journal for approval as the then current policies had required. Upon the discovery of this discrepancy, the then editors of the journal imposed a moratorium on new special issues for approximately two-three months pending review of the policies.[11] See also[edit] List of scientific journals List of philosophy journals Notes[edit] ^ a b "Synthese | Home". springer.com.
