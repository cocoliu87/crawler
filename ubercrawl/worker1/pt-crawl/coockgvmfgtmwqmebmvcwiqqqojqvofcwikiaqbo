The city of Sievierodonetsk acted as the administrative center of unoccupied Luhansk Oblast prior to the invasion. By May 2022, Sievierodonetsk and the neighbouring city of Lysychansk were the only notable parts of the oblast that remained under Ukrainian control.[7] By 14 June 2022, Russian forces had gained control of most of the city and cut off most escape routes.[31][32] On 24 June 2022, Ukrainian units were ordered to retreat from the city[33] and the next day Russian and pro-Russian separatist forces fully captured Sievierodonetsk.[2] The Russian advance shifted towards neighbouring Lysychansk, resulting in the battle of Lysychansk.[34] The battle of Sievierodonetsk was marked by fierce urban combat[35][36][37] and has been described as one of the war's bloodiest.[38][39] Around 90% of the city's buildings were destroyed or damaged.[40][41] Background Aftermath of Russian shelling in Sievierodonetsk on 6 April 2022 The twin cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk were the site of a series of battles in 2014 between pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian military during the war in Donbas.[7] Soon after the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, on 28 February 2022, Russian forces began to shell Sievierodonetsk.[42] According to Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk Oblast, one person was killed and several were injured. Gas pipelines were also hit by the shelling.[43] On 2 March, fighting was reported in almost all the villages near Sievierodonetsk.[44] Russian forces continued to shell the city, including a school gym that was acting as a bomb shelter. No deaths were reported.[45] At 15:20 that day, Ukrainian officials said Russian forces tried to break through Ukrainian lines towards the city, but were repelled.[46] A month into its invasion, Russia claimed to control 93% of Luhansk Oblast,[47] leaving Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk as strategically important Ukrainian holdouts in the area.[7] Russian plans to capture Sievierodonetsk hinged upon its successes in the nearby cities of Rubizhne to the north and Popasna to the south.[48] By 6 April, Russian forces had reportedly captured 60% of Rubizhne,[49] and shells and rockets were landing in Sievierodonetsk on "regular, sustained intervals".[50] The next day, forces of the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade conducted an offensive which reportedly drove Russian forces 6–10 kilometers away from the other nearby town of Kreminna.[12] By 9 April, elements of the Russian 4th Guards Tank Division were reportedly concentrating near Sievierodonetsk.[9] Between 11 and 12 April, continued Russian attacks in the area gained no ground.[51][52] On 18 April, Russia renewed its offensive in eastern Ukraine, launching airstrikes on Sievierodonetsk.[53][54] By the end of April, most of Sievierodonetsk's civilian population had fled.[55] In late April, Russian forces launched an all-out offensive along a 500-mile (800 km) front to fully capture remaining unoccupied territory of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts.[7] Battle Encirclement attempts Buildings in Sievierodonetsk destroyed by artillery fire On 6 May, Russian and Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) forces made gains in the outskirts of Sievierodonetsk, attacking the village of Voevodivka just north of the city, while also capturing the village of Voronove to the southeast. Other villages were also attacked in an attempt to surround the city.[56] Subsequently, it was reported by the city's mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk, that Sievierodonetsk was "virtually surrounded".[57] Over the next days, Russian and separatist forces attacked Bilohorivka, Voevodivka, and Lysychansk, intending to cut off Sievierodonetsk from the south. They also captured Popasna.[58] On 9 May, LPR troops reportedly took control of Nyzhnie and began attacking Toshkivka, two settlements southeast of Sievierodonetsk. Heavy combat continued in Rubizhne, Voevodivka, and Bilohorivka, as Russian forces attempted to further encircle Sievierodonetsk from the western axis.[59] The next day, Ukrainian forces destroyed a Russian pontoon bridge across the Donets river in the vicinity of Bilohorivka, attempting to disrupt the Russian advance, and reportedly destroying almost an entire Russian battalion in the process.[60][61] According to Ukrainian regional police chief Oleh Hryhorov, Sievierodonetsk and its direct neighbor, Lysychansk, had become tactically encircled, as Russian artillery could freely strike the remaining open roads into the city. Power and water supply was disrupted in the cities, leaving tens of thousands of civilians without basic necessities.[7] By 12 May, Russian and LPR forces had defeated Ukrainian forces in the battle of Rubizhne and established full control of the city, furthering their attempts at encircling Sievierodonetsk.[62][63] For the most part, Russia subsequently ceased its ground attacks on the surroundings of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk and limited itself to artillery bombardments. Pro-Russian forces instead focused on completing the encirclement of the two cities. To this end, they attacked at the northern frontline around Izium and in the south toward Bakhmut. The northern attacks made little to no progress, but in the south, Russia made limited advances over  contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 66 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Battle_of_Sievierodonetsk_(2022) responseCode 3 200
