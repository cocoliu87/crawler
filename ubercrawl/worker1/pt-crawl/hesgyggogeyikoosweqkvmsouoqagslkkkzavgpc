The city has a population of 247,863 (2010 census [INDEC]). History[edit] During the 16th century, inhabitants of the city of Santa Fe settled at the other shore of the Paraná river. The first settlers called it “Baxada del Paraná”. Between 1854 and 1861 it was the capital city of the Argentine Confederation. Economy[edit] Paraná is not only the head of the provincial government, but also an important river port for the transshipment of cereals, cattle, fish, and lumber from the surrounding region. The principal industries installed are the manufacture of cement, furniture, and ceramics. Cityscape[edit] The centre of the city gathers colonial churches, European styles such as that of the 3 de Febrero Theatre or the Government House, the mixed styles of the city's Cathedral, and modern towers like those near the Parque Urquiza park. The city is connected to the city of Santa Fe on the other side of the Entre Ríos by the Hernandarias Subfluvial Tunnel inaugurated in 1969.

winds can push temperatures below 10 °C (50.0 °F).[1] Most of the precipitation occurs during the summer, receiving an average precipitation of 400 mm (16 in).[1] The city, along with the entire province is located in an area of high risk of tornadoes in the country, particularly during spring and summer.[5] Paraná receives 1,069.1 mm (42.09 in) of precipitation per year, most of it
