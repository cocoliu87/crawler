The country was a loose confederation made up of three states: North Peru and South Peru—states that arose from the division of the Peruvian Republic due to the civil wars of 1834 and 1835 to 1836—as well as the Bolivian State.[2] The geographical limits of the Confederation varied over time, with Bolivia occupying and incorporating the disputed territories in northern Argentina in 1838. It also possessed de facto autonomous indigenous territories, such as Iquicha, all under the supreme command of Marshal Andrés de Santa Cruz, who assumed the position of Supreme Protector in 1836, while he was president of Bolivia. Although its institutional creation arose on May 1, 1837, with the Pact of Tacna [es], its de facto establishment dated from October 28, 1836[2]—with the end of the war between Salaverry and Santa Cruz—until August 25, 1839, with its dissolution proclaimed by General Agustín Gamarra,[3] the Peruvian restorationist president who declared war against the Confederation, supported by the United Restoration Army headed by himself and Chilean Manuel Bulnes—formerly the Restoration Army of Peru—made up of Peruvian and Bolivian opponents of the Confederation, as well as the governments and armies of Chile and Argentina. Both Chile and Argentina opposed the Confederation as a potential military and economic threat, and for its support for dissidents in exile. Argentina and Bolivia reached an agreement after their war over Tarija, and the Confederate Army was ultimately defeated by the United Restoration Army in the 1839 Battle of Yungay, which put an end to the War of the Confederation. Historian Jorge Basadre frames the confederation as part of a period of "determination of the nationalities" in western South America.[4] History[edit] Background[edit] See also: Salaverry-Santa Cruz War At the beginning of the 19th century, Simón Bolívar postulated the idea of creating a great nation, coinciding with Andrés de Santa Cruz, who thought of uniting Peru and Bolivia in a single country, the latter colloquially known as Upper Peru. The idea of uniting both countries was the general idea of several influential political leaders in Peru—including Francisco Xavier de Luna Pizarro, José María Pando [es], Manuel Lorenzo de Vidaurre [es], Agustín Gamarra, among others—who sought to reintegrate the two Perus, disagreeing only in the form of the “union”: confederation or merger. An important factor in the desire to unite these two states were the historical ties between both regions, even after independence.[5] After political instability and a coup d'état in 1835, a civil war broke out between newly self-declared president Felipe Santiago Salaverry and constitutional president Luis José de Orbegoso, who allowed Bolivian president Andrés de Santa Cruz to send his troops through the Peruvian border.[6] After the latter's triumph in 1836, assemblies were soon established to make way for the creation of the Confederation. Prelude[edit] Two constituent congresses were established in each of the three founding states of the confederation, in the cities of Huaura (North Peru), Sicuani (South-Peru) and Tapacarí (Bolivia). Immediately, the representatives of the three states promised to celebrate the union pact of the Peru–Bolivian Confederation as soon as possible. The Sicuani Assembly was established on March 16, 1836, and closed on March 22. It featured representatives from Ayacucho, Arequipa, Cuzco, Puno and Tacna.[7] On April 10, Orbegoso recognized South Peru as an independent state through a decree, and a Supreme Court was installed in Cuzco on August 24. The assembly also created the country's flag and currency. Fines were put in place to prevent the (now North) Peruvian flag from being flown.[8] The Huaura Assembly lasted from August 3 to 24, 1836, and featured representatives from La Libertad, Lima, Huaylas [es], Maynas and Junín.[7] On August 11, North Peru was officially established through the promulgation of its constitution by the then President Orbegoso, naming Santa Cruz—who triumphantly entered Lima on August 15—as the Supreme Protector of the state. Orbegoso also presented his resignation, but it was not approved by the assembly, who named him provisional president. The assembly also established the new territorial divisions of the country.[9] Unlike its new southern neighbour, North Peru maintained the national symbols of its predecessor.[10] In the case of Bolivia, a special session of the Tapacarí Congress [es] had previously been held on June 21, 1836, which authorized Santa Cruz to complete the confederation project to which Bolivia had already adhered with the Law of July 22, 1835. Around that time, Santa Cruz received the diploma and insignia of Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour, with which the King of France honored him. He also received a communication from Pope Gregory XVI and a rosary with his medal, blessed by the Pope himself.[11] Establishment[edit] Provided, then, with all the legal elements granted by the assemblies of the three states, Santa Cruz decreed the establishment of the Peru–Bolivian Confederation, by decree given in Lima on October 28, 1836.[11][12] A congress known today as the Congress of Tacna (Spanish: Congreso de Tacna) was ordered to meet in Tacna to establish the foundations of the confederation. A customs office was also opened in Arica, which employed both South Peruvians and Bolivians.[13] During the meeting, Santa Cruz arranged for each state to send a priest, a soldier and a lawyer as delegates before, and consequently, three religious, three lawyers and three soldiers marched to Tacna. The nine delegates were as follows: Representing North Peru Tomás Diéguez de Florencia [es], bishop of Trujillo Manuel Tellería Vicuña [es], lawyer and member of the Supreme Court Francisco Quirós y Ampudia [es], colonel Representing South Peru José Sebastián de Goyeneche y Barreda [es], bishop of Arequipa Pedro José Flórez, lawyer and judge of Ayacucho Juan José Larrea, colonel Representing Bolivia José María Mendizábal, bishop of La Plata Pedro Buitrago, lawyer and member of the Supreme Court Miguel María de Aguirre, colonel Initially, January 24, 1837, was chosen as the congress' date, but it had to be postponed. Santa Cruz decided to accompany the plenipotentiaries of the North-Peruvian State, for which reason he left Lima and embarked on the frigate Flora on February 9, but instead of disembarking in Islay, he went to Arica, where he arrived on February 27. The congress was postponed to April 18; Meanwhile, Santa Cruz remained in Arica, but on March 2 he headed for Tacna, where he was received with much fanfare. From Tacna he went to Viacha on March 10, arriving in La Paz the following day. There, together with the Bolivian plenipotentiaries Aguirre and Buitrago, and Bolivian Vice President Mariano Enrique Calvo, he agreed on the project that should be discussed and approved in Tacna. Then, in the first days of April, he went down to Tacna again. On April 18, 1837, the Tacna Congress was inaugurated, with the presence of the nine delegates. The Pact of Tacna (Spanish: Pacto de Tacna) was signed without debate during the congress. It established the legal framework through which the state would operate, and also included the design of the flag.[14] Reactions to the pact were mixed event among its signatories, and disagreements led to the establishment of one constituent congress per member state.[15] The act was later promulgated in 1837. Political instability and wars[edit] Main articles: War of the Confederation and Tarija War Like Orbegoso, Santa Cruz also had many opponents and enemies born in the frequent caudillo clashes of the early years of Peru's republican history. Among those enemies were powerful characters such as Agustín Gamarra and Ramón Castilla, who at the time were exiled in Chile.[7][16] The rivalry that existed between the ports of Callao and Valparaíso worsened as a result of the establishment of the Confederation.[12] A tariff war soon began between both states,[17] and Orbegoso supported Ramón Freire's failed expedition against Diego Portales.[18][19] The Congress of Chile approved the declaration of war on December 26, 1836,[19] claiming that Santa Cruz's rule over Peru was illegitimate, and that his influence threatened the integrity of other South American nations, as seen by Orbegoso's support for the attempted invasion of Chile by Freire, specifically pointing out the attempt on Portales.[20] A territorial dispute between Argentina and Bolivia over the territory of Tarija escalated, as Bolivia occupied and annexed the territory[21] and Juan Manuel de Rosas then declared war on the Confederation on May 19, 1837, accusing Santa Cruz of harboring supporters of the Unitarian Party. The accusations ended up being true, as Santa Cruz had financially supported the émigrés.[22] Portales was assassinated in Valparaíso after a mutiny broke out in Quillota, leading to preparations for the invasion of South Peru.[19] Thus, the first "Restorative Expedition" left Valparaíso on contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 69 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Peru%E2%80%93Bolivian_Confederation responseCode 3 200
