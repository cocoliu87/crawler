Located at the confluence of the Svitava and Svratka rivers, Brno has about 390,000 inhabitants, making it the second-largest city in the Czech Republic after the capital, Prague, and one of the 100 largest cities of the EU. The Brno metropolitan area has almost 700,000 inhabitants.[2] Brno is the former capital city of Moravia and the political and cultural hub of the South Moravian Region. It is the centre of the Czech judiciary, with the seats of the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, the Supreme Administrative Court, and the Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office, and a number of state authorities, including the Ombudsman,[6] and the Office for the Protection of Competition.[7] Brno is also an important centre of higher education, with 33 faculties belonging to 13 institutes of higher education and about 62,000 students.[8] Brno Exhibition Centre is among the largest exhibition centres in Europe.[9] The complex opened in 1928 and established the tradition of large exhibitions and trade fairs held in Brno.[10] Brno hosts motorbike and other races on the Masaryk Circuit, a tradition established in 1930, of which the Road Racing World Championship Grand Prix is one of the most prestigious races.[11] Another cultural tradition is an international fireworks competition, Ignis Brunensis,[12] which attracts tens of thousands of visitors to each display.[13] The most visited sights of the city include the Špilberk Castle and fortress and the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul on Petrov hill, two medieval buildings that dominate the cityscape and are often depicted as its traditional symbols[citation needed]. The other large preserved castle near the city is Veveří Castle by Brno Reservoir.[14][15][16] Another architectural monument of Brno is the functionalist Villa Tugendhat, which was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in 2001.[17] One of the natural sights nearby is the Moravian Karst. The city is a member of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network and was designated a "City of Music" in 2017.[18] Administrative divisions[edit] Brno is divided into 29 self-governing districts, further sub-divided into 48 administrative parts.[19] The districts are:[20] Brno-Bohunice Brno-Bosonohy Brno-Bystrc Brno-Černovice Brno-Chrlice Brno-Ivanovice Brno-Jehnice Brno-jih Brno-Jundrov Brno-Kníničky Brno-Kohoutovice Brno-Komín Brno-Královo Pole Brno-Líšeň Brno-Maloměřice and Obřany Brno-Medlánky Brno-North Brno-Nový Lískovec Brno-Ořešín Brno-Řečkovice and Mokrá Hora Brno-Slatina Brno-střed Brno-Starý Lískovec Brno-Tuřany Brno-Útěchov Brno-Vinohrady Brno-Žabovřesky Brno-Žebětín Brno-Židenice Names[edit] The etymology of the name Brno is disputed. It might be derived from the Old Czech brnie 'muddy, swampy.'[21] Alternative derivations are a Slavic verb brniti (to armour or to fortify) or a Celtic language spoken in the area before it was inhabited by Germanic peoples and later Slavic peoples. The latter theory would make it cognate with other Celtic words for hill, such as the Welsh word bryn. Throughout its history, Brno's locals also referred to the town in other languages, including Brünn in German, ברין (Brin) in Yiddish, and Bruna in Latin. The city was also referred to as Brunn (/brʌn/)[22] in English, but that usage is not common today.[23] The asteroid 2889 Brno was named after the city, as was the Bren light machine gun (from Brno and Enfield), which was widely used in World War II. History[edit] The 10 CZK coin (1993 design) Main articles: History of Brno and Timeline of Brno The Brno basin has been inhabited since prehistoric times,[24] but the town's direct predecessor was a fortified settlement of the Great Moravian Empire known as Staré Zámky, which was inhabited from the Neolithic Age until the early 11th century.[25] In the early 11th century Brno was established as a castle of a non-ruling prince from the House of Přemyslid,[24] and Brno became one of the centres of Moravia along with Olomouc and Znojmo. Brno was first mentioned in Cosmas' Chronica Boëmorum dated to the year 1091, when Bohemian king Vratislav II besieged his brother Conrad at Brno castle.[26] Coat of arms of the margraviate In the mid 11th century, Moravia was divided into three separate territories; each had its own ruler, coming from the Přemyslids dynasty, but independent of the other two, and subordinate only to the Bohemian ruler in Prague. The seats of these rulers and thus the "capitals" of these territories were the castles and towns of Brno, Olomouc, and Znojmo. In the late 12th century, Moravia began to reunify, forming the Margraviate of Moravia. From then until the mid of the 17th century, it was not clear which town should be the capital of Moravia. Political power was divided between Brno and Olomouc, but Znojmo also played an important role. The Moravian Diet, the Moravian Land Tables, and the Moravian Land Court were all seated in both cities at once.[clarification needed] However, Brno was the official seat of the Moravian Margraves (rulers of Moravia),[27] and later its geographical position closer to Vienna also became important. Otherwise, until 1642 Olomouc had a larger population than Brno, and was the seat of the only Roman Catholic diocese in Moravia. Unsuccessful Swedish siege in 1645 In 1243 Brno was granted the large and small city privileges[clarification needed] by the King, and was thus recognized as a royal city. As throughout Eastern Central Europe, the granting of city privileges was connected with immigration from German-speaking lands. In 1324 Queen Elisabeth Richeza of Poland founded the Basilica of the Assumption of Our Lady, which now houses her grave.[28] In the 14th century, Brno became one of the centres for the Moravian regional assemblies, whose meetings alternated between Brno and Olomouc.[24] These assemblies made political, legal, and financial decisions. Brno and Olomouc were also the seats of the Land Court and the Moravian Land Tables, thus they were the two most important cities in Moravia. From the mid 14th century to the early 15th century, Špilberk Castle had served as the permanent seat of the Margraves of Moravia; one of them was elected the King of the Romans. Brno was besieged in 1428 and again in 1430 by the Hussites during the Hussite Wars. Both attempts to conquer the city failed. 17th century[edit] Coat of arms of the Margraviate of Moravia in Book of the state of lords with the picture of Brno (1670) In 1641, during the Thirty Years' War, the Holy Roman Emperor and Margrave of Moravia Ferdinand III ordered the permanent relocation of the diet, court, and the land tables from Olomouc to Brno, as Olomouc's Collegium Nordicum made it one of the primary targets of Swedish armies.[29] In 1642 Olomouc surrendered to the Swedish Army, which occupied it for eight years.[note 1] Meanwhile, Brno, as the only Moravian city which, under the leadership of Jean-Louis Raduit de Souches, succeeded in defending itself from the Swedes under General Lennart Torstenson, served as the sole capital of the Margraviate of Moravia. After the end of the Thirty Years' War in 1648, Brno retained its status as the sole capital. This was later confirmed by the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II in 1782, and again in 1849 by the Moravian constitution.[note 2] Today, the Moravian Land Tables are stored in the Moravian Regional Archive, and are included among the national cultural sights of the Czech Republic.[30] Brno c. 1700 During the 17th century Špilberk Castle was rebuilt as a huge baroque citadel.[27] Brno was besieged by the Prussian Army in 1742 under the leadership of Frederick the Great, but the siege was ultimately unsuccessful. In 1777 the bishopric of Brno was established by the Catholic Church; Mathias Franz Graf von Chorinsky Freiherr von Ledske was the first Bishop.[24][note 3] 19th century[edit] In December 1805 the Battle of Austerlitz was fought near the city; the battle is also known as the "Battle of the Three Emperors". Brno itself was not involved with the battle, but the French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte spent several nights here at that time, and again in 1809.[31][32] In 1839 the first train arrived in Brno from Vienna; this was the beginning of rail transport in what is now the Czech Republic.[33] In the years 1859–1864 the city fortifications were almost completely removed. In 1869 a horsecar service started to operate in Brno, the first tram service in what would later become the Czech Republic.[34] Gregor Mendel conducted his groundbreaking experiments in genetics while he was a monk at St. Thomas's Abbey in Brno in the 1850s. 20th century and Greater Brno[edit] Lands and their capitals (underlined) of the First Czechoslovak Republic Main railway station in 1901 Around 1900 Brno, which consisted in administrative terms only of the central city ar contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 44 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Br%C3%BCnn responseCode 3 200
