The result of the discussion was moved. A fact from Orchard MRT station appeared on Wikipedia's Main Page in the Did you know column on 20 November 2023 (check views). The text of the entry was as follows: Did you know... that Orchard MRT station had a dome over the station's circular concourse until it was removed in 2008?

Wikipedia Fair use rationale for Image:NS logo.jpg[edit] Image:NS logo.jpg is being used on this article. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in this Wikipedia article constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. If there is other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page. Note that any fair use images lacking such an explanation can be deleted one week after being tagged, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page. Thank you.

The four images in a row extend down past the start of the references, which squishes the references.
