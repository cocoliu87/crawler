yiposadknofibgmmgkrcvebqyoakcojseotsycao page 5423 This help page is a how-to guide. It details processes or procedures of some aspect(s) of Wikipedia's norms and practices. It is not one of Wikipedia's policies or guidelines, and may reflect varying levels of consensus and vetting. Shortcut WP:DOS "Dos and don'ts" pages are information pages that summarize Wikipedia policies, guidelines, and style in bullet points. They present the most important points in a quick list, for the benefit of editors who are not inclined to read the full, authoritative guidance. They are especially useful for highlighting guidance that is unique to Wikipedia. Keys to a good "dos and don'ts" page[edit] To apply a standard format, use the template {{dodont}}. Keep bullets short – for more information, users can always check the full guideline. Only include the most important and non-obvious points from the guideline. Try to keep the "dos" and "don'ts" lists the same length, with 5–8 bullets each. Bold and wikilink the key terms in each bullet. List the most important bullets at the top. Link to a relevant WikiProject, if one exists. Add the page to relevant Wikipedia namespace categories. Include the {{Help Project}} banner, and any other relevant WikiProject banners, on the talk page.
