The term "paraboloid" is derived from parabola, which refers to a conic section that has a similar property of symmetry. Every plane section of a paraboloid by a plane parallel to the axis of symmetry is a parabola. The paraboloid is hyperbolic if every other plane section is either a hyperbola, or two crossing lines (in the case of a section by a tangent plane). The paraboloid is elliptic if every other nonempty plane section is either an ellipse, or a single point (in the case of a section by a tangent plane). A paraboloid is either elliptic or hyperbolic. Equivalently, a paraboloid may be defined as a quadric surface that is not a cylinder, and has an implicit equation whose part of degree two may be factored over the complex numbers into two different linear factors. The paraboloid is hyperbolic if the factors are real; elliptic if the factors are complex conjugate. An elliptic paraboloid is shaped like an oval cup and has a maximum or minimum point when its axis is vertical. In a suitable coordinate system with three axes x, y, and z, it can be represented by the equation[1] z = x 2 a 2 + y 2 b 2 . {\displaystyle z={\frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}}+{\frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}}.} where a and b are constants that dictate the level of curvature in the xz and yz planes respectively. In this position, the elliptic paraboloid opens upward. Hyperbolic paraboloid A hyperbolic paraboloid (not to be confused with a hyperboloid) is a doubly ruled surface shaped like a saddle. In a suitable coordinate system, a hyperbolic paraboloid can be represented by the equation[2][3] z = y 2 b 2 − x 2 a 2 . {\displaystyle z={\frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}}-{\frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}}.} In this position, the hyperbolic paraboloid opens downward along the x-axis and upward along the y-axis (that is, the parabola in the plane x = 0 opens upward and the parabola in the plane y = 0 opens downward). Any paraboloid (elliptic or hyperbolic) is a translation surface, as it can be generated by a moving parabola directed by a second parabola. Properties and applications[edit] Elliptic paraboloid[edit] Polygon mesh of a circular paraboloid Circular paraboloid In a suitable Cartesian coordinate system, an elliptic paraboloid has the equation z = x 2 a 2 + y 2 b 2 . {\displaystyle z={\frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}}+{\frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}}.} If a = b, an elliptic paraboloid is a circular paraboloid or paraboloid of revolution. It is a surface of revolution obtained by revolving a parabola around its axis. A circular paraboloid contains circles. This is also true in the general case (see Circular section). From the point of view of projective geometry, an elliptic paraboloid is an ellipsoid that is tangent to the plane at infinity. Plane sections The plane sections of an elliptic paraboloid can be: a parabola, if the plane is parallel to the axis, a point, if the plane is a tangent plane. an ellipse or empty, otherwise. Parabolic reflector[edit] Main articles: Parabolic reflector and parabolic antenna On the axis of a circular paraboloid, there is a point called the focus (or focal point), such that, if the paraboloid is a mirror, light (or other waves) from a point source at the focus is reflected into a parallel beam, parallel to the axis of the paraboloid. This also works the other way around: a parallel beam of light that is parallel to the axis of the paraboloid is concentrated at the focal point. For a proof, see Parabola § Proof of the reflective property. Therefore, the shape of a circular paraboloid is widely used in astronomy for parabolic reflectors and parabolic antennas. The surface of a rotating liquid is also a circular paraboloid. This is used in liquid-mirror telescopes and in making solid telescope mirrors (see rotating furnace). Parallel rays coming into a circular paraboloidal mirror are reflected to the focal point, F, or vice versa Parabolic reflector Rotating water in a glass Hyperbolic paraboloid[edit] A hyperbolic paraboloid with lines contained in it Pringles fried snacks are in the shape of a hyperbolic paraboloid. The hyperbolic paraboloid is a doubly ruled surface: it contains two families of mutually skew lines. The lines in each family are parallel to a common plane, but not to each other. Hence the hyperbolic paraboloid is a conoid. These properties characterize hyperbolic paraboloids and are used in one of the oldest definitions of hyperbolic paraboloids: a hyperbolic paraboloid is a surface that may be generated by a moving line that is parallel to a fixed plane and crosses two fixed skew lines. This property makes it simple to manufacture a hyperbolic paraboloid from a variety of materials and for a variety of purposes, from concrete roofs to snack foods. In particular, Pringles fried snacks resemble a truncated hyperbolic paraboloid.[4] A hyperbolic paraboloid is a saddle surface, as its Gauss curvature is negative at every point. Therefore, although it is a ruled surface, it is not developable. From the point of view of projective geometry, a hyperbolic paraboloid is one-sheet hyperboloid that is tangent to the plane at infinity. A hyperbolic paraboloid of equation z = a x y {\displaystyle z=axy} or z = a 2 ( x 2 − y 2 ) {\displaystyle z={\tfrac {a}{2}}(x^{2}-y^{2})} (this is the same up to a rotation of axes) may be called a rectangular hyperbolic paraboloid, by analogy with rectangular hyperbolas. Plane sections A hyperbolic paraboloid with hyperbolas and parabolas A plane section of a hyperbolic paraboloid with equation z = x 2 a 2 − y 2 b 2 {\displaystyle z={\frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}}-{\frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}}} can be a line, if the plane is parallel to the z-axis, and has an equation of the form b x ± a y + b = 0 {\displaystyle bx\pm ay+b=0} , a parabola, if the plane is parallel to the z-axis, and the section is not a line, a pair of intersecting lines, if the plane is a tangent plane, a hyperbola, otherwise. STL hyperbolic paraboloid model Examples in architecture[edit] Saddle roofs are often hyperbolic paraboloids as they are easily constructed from straight sections of material.

The hyperbolic paraboloid,[2] when parametrized as σ → ( u , v ) = ( u , v , u 2 a 2 − v 2 b 2 ) {\displaystyle {\vec {\sigma }}(u,v)=\left(u,v,{\frac {u^{2}}{a^{2}}}-{\frac {v^{2}}{b^{2}}}\right)} has Gaussian curvature K ( u , v ) = − 4 a 2 b 2 ( 1 + 4 u 2 a 4 + 4 v 2 b 4 ) 2 {\displaystyle K(u,v)={\frac {-4}{a^{2}b^{2}\left(1+{\frac {4u^{2}}{a^{4}}}+{\frac {4v^{2}}{b^{4}}}\right)^{2}}}} and mean curvature H ( u , v ) = − a 2 + b 2 − 4 u 2 a 2 + 4 v 2 b 2 a 2 b 2 ( 1 + 4 u 2 a 4 + 4 v 2 b 4 ) 3 . {\displaystyle H(u,v)={\frac {-a^{2}+b^{2}-{\frac {4u^{2}}{a^{2}}}+{\frac {4v^{2}}{b^{2}}}}{a^{2}b^{2}{\sqrt {\left(1+{\frac {4u^{2}}{a^{4}}}+{\frac {4v^{2}}{b^{4}}}\right)^{3}}}}}.} Geometric representation of multiplication table[edit] If the hyperbolic paraboloid z = x 2 a 2 − y 2 b 2 {\displaystyle z={\frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}}-{\frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}}} is rotated by an angle of π/4 in the +z direction (according to the right hand rule), the result is the surface z = ( x 2 + y 2 2 ) ( 1 a 2 − 1 b 2 ) + x y ( 1 a 2 + 1 b 2 ) {\displaystyle z=\left({\frac {x^{2}+y^{2}}{2}}\right)\left({\frac {1}{a^{2}}}-{\frac {1}{b^{2}}}\right)+xy\left({\frac {1}{a^{2}}}+{\frac {1} contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 44 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Paraboloid responseCode 3 200
