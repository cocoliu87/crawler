Founded on 10 April 2009, the AA is the military wing of the United League of Arakan (ULA). It is currently led by commander in chief Major General Twan Mrat Naing and vice deputy commander Brigadier General Nyo Twan Awng.[1] The Arakan Army states that the objective of its armed revolution is to restore the sovereignty of the Arakan people.[13] In a December 2021 interview, Twan Mrat Naing claimed that the AA had grown to 30,000 troops.[6] In the early 2010s, the Arakan Army fought alongside the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) against the Tatmadaw (Myanmar Armed Forces) in the Kachin conflict. Following the 2016 outbreak of conflict in Rakhine state, AA became more heavily involved in the Arakan region.[14] In 2019, AA would launch attacks on state security forces and the Myanmar Army would respond heightening clashes.[15][16] The AA reached a ceasefire in late 2020 after eroding the central government's control in northern Rakhine. The power vacuum would be filled by the AA over the next 18 months with state-building efforts, like their COVID-19 vaccine rollouts.[17] During the 2021 Myanmar civil war, the ceasefire would break down and armed clashes resumed in July 2022 after a Tatmadaw airstrike against an AA base.[18] The two sides would agree to a temporary ceasefire in November 2022, reportedly for humanitarian reasons.[19] Origin[edit] The Arakan Army (AA) was founded on 10 April 2009 along with its political wing, the United League of Arakan (ULA), in what it describes as its "temporary headquarters" in Laiza, Kachin State.[20] Following training, the group planned to return to Arakan State and fight for self-determination; however, with the outbreak of fighting in Kachin State in June 2011, they were unable to. As a result, they took up arms against the Myanmar Army in support of the KIA. In 2014, the AA started a settlement in Rakhine State near the border with Bangladesh and another near the border of Thai-Myanmar with which it has become much stronger and its combat abilities have been positively impacted.[21] In February 2015, AA fought alongside the Myanmar Nationalities Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), an ethnic armed group, and its ally the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) in their conflict with the Myanmar Army.[22] Hundreds of Tatmadaw's soldiers were reportedly killed in this conflict. On 27 August 2015, there was a clash between the AA and Bangladesh border guard forces, with both sides opening fire near the Boro Modak area of Thanci in the Bandarban district, near the shared Burma-Bangladesh border.[23] On 20 August 2015, the Arakan Army clashed with a Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB), after ten of their horses had been confiscated by the BGB earlier that day.[24] Objectives[edit] The Arakan Army purportedly advocates for self-determination for the multi-ethnic Arakanese population, the safeguarding and promotion of the national identity and cultural heritage of the Arakan people, and the "national dignity" and best interests of the Arakan people. In an interview with the Arakha Media (AKK) conducted in August 2021, Commander-in-chief of the Arakan Army clearly stated that the political objective of the armed revolution is to restore the sovereignty of the Arakan, and there had been no bargaining in the attempt to regain the lost sovereignty and there would not be in the future either.[13][25] Deployment[edit] Most AA soldiers were originally trained at the KIA Military Academy. Since 2014, the AA has set up its own training camps in Rakhine State. According to the Myanmar Peace Monitor, the AA had more than 1,500 troops in 2014,[26] including personnel stationed in the Rakhine State near Myanmar's border with Bangladesh.[27][28][29] The Irrawaddy stated in September 2015 that the AA had more than 2,500 troops and 10,000 personnel in their civilian wing.[30] In June 2020, the AA chief claimed that the group has more than 20,000 soldiers.[31] In a December 2021 interview, Twan Mrat Naing claimed that the AA had grown to 30,000 troops.[6] Although the AA was initially trained by the KIA, it later aligned itself more with the United Wa State Army through the Federal Political Negotiation and Consultative Committee. All three groups are also part of the Northern Alliance.[32][33] In 2020, India accused China of assisting rebel groups, including the UWSA and AA, by supplying weapons and providing hideouts within Indian territory.[34] AA has received Chinese-made weapons, such as surface-to-surface missiles used during an attack on the Myanmar navy in 2019.[35] However, there is little evidence to directly confirm Chinese involvement as Chinese weapons may have been supplied by the UWSA, who has a closer relationship with China. The Arakan Army has targeted India's Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project but not China's projects in the region, leading some to accuse China of diplo-terrorism.[33][36] Armed conflict[edit] Early clashes[edit] Young Arakan Army soldiers in 2021 See also: Northern Rakhine State clashes In April 2015, the AA clashed with the Myanmar Army in Kyauktaw Township of Rakhine State and Paletwa Township of Chin State.[37] In December 2015, the Tatmadaw and the Arakan Army engaged in several days of fighting, around 60 kilometres (37 mi) north of Sittwe at the border between Kyauktaw and Mrauk U townships. An unknown number of military personnel were killed in the fighting.[38] Several Tatmadaw personnel, including one commanding officer, were killed in sniper attacks. Many others were injured.[39] Following clashes between Rohingya insurgents and Burmese security forces in northern Rakhine State in October 2016, the Arakan Army released a press statement, calling the perpetrators (the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army) "savage Bengali Muslim terrorists" and the violence a "rampage of the Bengali Islamic fundamentalist militants in northern Arakan."[8] In November 2017, Arakan Army was involved in heavy clashes with the Tatmadaw in Chin State, in which 11 Tatmadaw soldiers were killed.[40] According to the BBC, there was popular support for the Arakan Army in Mrauk U and a number of men from the town have recently joined the group.[41] 2018–2020 war with the Tatmadaw[edit] Northern Rakhine State cities On 21 December 2018, the Myanmar Army declared a four-month unilateral ceasefire in five conflict areas, saying it would hold talks with non-signatories of the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) during the ceasefire period. However, the Western Command (stationed in Chin State and Rakhine State) was notably excluded from the unilateral ceasefire announcement and an increase in clashes between the Tatmadaw and the Arakan Army was reported.[14][42] On 4 January 2019, around 300 members of the Arakan Army launched pre-dawn attacks on four border police outposts—Kyaung Taung, Nga Myin Taw, Ka Htee La and Kone Myint—in northern Buthidaung Township.[15] Thirteen members of the Border Guard Police (BGP) were killed and nine others were injured,[43][44][45] whilst 40 firearms and more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition were taken by the Arakan Army. The Arakan Army later stated that it had captured nine BGP personnel and five civilians, and that three of its fighters were also killed in the attacks.[46][47] Following the attacks, the Office of the President of Myanmar held a high-level meeting on national security in the capital Naypyidaw on 7 January 2019, and instructed the Defense Ministry to increase troop deployments in the areas that were attacked and to use aircraft if necessary.[48] Myanmar Army soldiers from the 22nd Light Infantry Division, elements of the 66th and 99th Light Infantry Divisions, and battalions from the Western Command of the Tatmadaw were reportedly involved in the subsequent military offensive against the Arakan Army. Clashes were reported in Maungdaw, Buthidaung, Kyauktaw, Rathedaung and Ponnagyun Townships, located in the northern and central parts of Rakhine State. The Rakhine State government issued a notice blocking non-governmental organisations and UN agencies, except for the International Committee of the Red Cross and the World Food Programme, from travelling to rural areas in these townships affected by the conflict. The fighting prompted 5,000 civilians to flee from their homes a contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 45 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Arakan_Army responseCode 3 200
