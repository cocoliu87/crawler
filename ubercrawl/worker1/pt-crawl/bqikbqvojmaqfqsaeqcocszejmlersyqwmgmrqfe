Same result on Chrome. Android Firefox and Android Chrome, Samsung Galaxy S22 5G. Pingnova (talk) 01:32, 23 September 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Hmm, I'm experiencing the same thing. Presumably there is some recent change that is causing this. Anyone able to pinpoint? {{u|Sdkb}} talk 03:08, 23 September 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] It seems like the Please explain what exact purpose this file will serve in the article. box was broken at some point. I don't see any recent edits to the js or css. The only recent edit is by Izno Jo-Jo Eumerus (talk) 07:21, 23 September 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] This was fixed for awhile but I'm having the same issue again. @Matma Rex or @Izno could this be from the recent change? Pingnova (talk) 19:44, 1 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Seems extremely unlikely. If my change broke something, it would be problems with the actual upload, rather than the form not loading. As a wild guess, maybe this is the same problem as Wikipedia:Village pump (technical)#Editor stopped working? Matma Rex talk 22:24, 5 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] I checked my settings per the link you shared, doesn't seem to be the issue. I switched from en.m. to desktop, just en., and I could use the form finally. It must be an issue with the mobile web version. Pingnova (talk) 19:24, 7 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] New description not saved when overwriting a file This edit request to MediaWiki:FileUploadWizard.js has been answered. Set the |answered= or |ans= parameter to no to reactivate your request. When uploading a file with the same name as an existing file, and choosing the option "Yes, I want to overwrite the existing file, and I will use this wizard to add a new description and new source information for it", the new description and other information you provide is not saved. The file is still uploaded, and everything looks fine, but your input is lost. There's an error message in the browser console: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #TargetForm .[name="text"]. WMF error logging indicates that this affected at least 8 upload attempts in the last 90 days [1] (this link requires NDA, sorry), older data isn't available. To fix it, please replace:                   text   : ($('#TargetForm .[name="text"]')[0]).value
 With:                   text   : ($('#TargetForm [name="text"]')[0]).value
 The mistake was introduced in 2012 in this edit: [2] but the code worked until the jQuery 1.8 upgrade later that year [3]. Afterwards the same problem was corrected in this script in other places [4] [5], but as this feature is used more rarely, it slipped through. I couldn't find any bug report about this anywhere, and it has been broken for over 10 years, so… maybe also consider whether this feature is really required?

Set the |answered= or |ans= parameter to no to reactivate your request. The use of <iframe> in this script requires Wikipedia to use a certain less secure configuration (see T131183 for details). We no longer support old web browsers that required this approach (the script does not even load). I have prepared a new version that uses AJAX instead: User:Matma Rex/MediaWiki:FileUploadWizard.js. It's a larger change, so before I put an {{Edit fully-protected}} here, it'd be good for someone to review it: compare changes. Thanks. Matma Rex talk 20:12, 30 September 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] @Future Perfect at Sunrise As the original author, any chance you'd like to have a look at these changes? Matma Rex talk 14:05, 2 October 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] I also asked for feedback at Wikipedia:Village pump (technical)#Site script code review request and it seems folks there approve. Matma Rex talk 22:10, 6 October 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Done Please ping Matma Rex and me if Matma broke it. :) Izno (talk) 00:03, 8 October 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 67 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:File_upload_wizard responseCode 3 200
