Bodies were hanging on the rubble, many of them unrecognized. Some were bleeding and others were burnt. ... I saw women screaming and confused. They didn’t know whether to cry for losing their children or run and look for them, especially since many children were playing in the neighborhood."[14] Atef Abu Seif, Minister of Culture of the Palestinian Authority of President Mahmoud Abbas and a well-known critic of Hamas, likewise spoke of "apocalyptic" scenes to Der Spiegel, saying more than 50 houses were "smashed, crushed. In each house there were dozens of people, families and relatives who had fled here from outside because their areas were bombed ... They bombed the center, the heart of the refugee camp. No place in all of Palestine is probably as densely populated as this. Now we can't even make out where which building began and ended."[15] Médecins Sans Frontières reported treating children with burns and deep wounds.[16] The New York Times and experts it consulted concluded that at least two 2,000-pound bombs were used.[17] According to IDF officials, Israel targeted the space between buildings to destroy an underground tunnel complex and said that the collapse of the tunnel network caused the foundations of nearby buildings to collapse in turn causing the collapse of those buildings.[18] Casualties The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry initially reported 50 people were killed and 150 injured.[6] The Indonesian Hospital nearby said it received 120 dead bodies and treated 280 wounded, and the majority were women and children.[6][19] Agence France-Presse's footage showed 47 dead bodies being pulled out from the rubble.[6] The New York Times also confirmed that footage showed that children, some dead, were pulled from the rubble.[12] The Qassam Brigades, Hamas's military wing, said the attack killed "seven civilian hostages [...] including three foreign passport holders".[20] The Gaza Health Ministry stated on 1 November that the strikes on both days killed 195 people and injured 777 others, with 120 more missing beneath the rubble.[21] Aftermath Israeli justification The IDF said the operation targeted and killed a Hamas commander, Ibrahim Biari, who they said led the 7 October attack on Israel.[22][14][23] Hamas denied the presence of any commander and said Israel was using these claims as an excuse for the attack.[10] IDF spokesman Richard Hecht described civilian deaths as a tragic consequence of war and accused Hamas of using them as human shields, noting that civilians had been warned to move south.[14] International law On 2 Nov, the United Nations human rights office stated on Twitter that the attack could constitute a war crime, given the "high number of civilian casualties and the scale of destruction".[24][25] Omar Shakir, a Human Rights Watch director, said that warnings to evacuate an area "does not absolve parties from the requirement to protect civilians" who have not evacuated. He also said that "international law prohibits attacks in which the expected harm to civilians and civilian properties is disproportionate to the anticipated military gain".[26] International reactions The attack was immediately condemned by the Egyptian, Saudi, Jordanian, and Qatari foreign ministries.[27] Bolivia severed diplomatic relations with Israel, and Colombia and Chile recalled their ambassadors.[28] Al Jazeera reporter Anas Al Shareef was on the scene, stating, "It's a massive massacre. It is hard to count the number of buildings that have been destroyed here."[29] Nebal Farsakh, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent described the scene as "absolutely horrific."[30] Norwegian doctor Mads Gilbert stated, "There is absolutely no doubt that this is a mass murder."[31] Melanie Ward, chief executive of the UK nonprofit Medical Aid for Palestinians, stated, "This attack marks a new low and should serve as a wake-up call to world leaders and politicians everywhere. Their meek requests for compliance with international law are being ignored entirely; Israel has instead increased the ferocity of its indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks."[32] Doctors Without Borders condemned the airstrike, stating "Enough is enough!"[33] Brazilian President Lula da Silva, stated on X: "For the first time, we are witnessing a war in which the majority of the dead are children … Stop! For the love of God, stop!"[34] Martin Griffiths stated, "This is just the latest atrocity to befall the people of Gaza where the fighting has entered an even more terrifying phase – with increasingly dreadful humanitarian consequences."[35] Professor Tamer Qarmout of the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies stated, "The complicity and silence from the international community on these war crimes, Israel carpet bombing the densest refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. It's insane that Israel is using this war tactic now... Basically what they're saying to Hamas, in my opinion, is, 'We don't want a street fight, we're ready to wipe out Gaza City.'"[36] UNICEF called the airstrike "horrific and appalling."[37] Countries Argentina condemned the attack, with the Foreign Ministry stating, "Nothing justifies the violation of international humanitarian law."[38] Bolivia severed diplomatic relations with Israel.[28] Chile recalled its Israeli ambassador.[28] Colombia recalled its Israeli ambassador.[28] Egypt condemned the Israeli attack as an indiscriminate attack against civilians and a flagrant violation of international law.[39] Foreign Affairs minister Catherine Colonna stated France was deeply concerned about the "the very heavy toll on the Palestinian civilian populations from the Israeli strikes against the Jabalia camp and expresses its compassion for the victims," and added "protection of civilian populations is an obligation of international law, which is binding on everyone."[40] Germany's foreign minister Annalena Baerbock emphasized Israel's right of self-defense and stated that Hamas was consciously using people in the camp as human shields.[41] Jordan recalled its Israeli ambassador and advised Israel that its own ambassador should not return to Jordan as long as the war and humanitarian crisis in Gaza were ongoing.[42] The Qatari foreign ministry released a statement condemning the attack.[27] Saudi Arabia condemned the attack as a violation of international humanitarian law, and deplored the international community's failure to pressure Israel into a ceasefire.[43] The United Arab Emirates condemned the Israeli attack and called for an immediate ceasefire.[44] The United States, in the immediate aftermath, declined to comment on the attack.[45] Multi-national organizations The Arab League deplored the bombing of the Jabaliya refugee camp and called for the immediate delivery of aid to the Gaza Strip.[46] Josep Borrell Fontelles, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, wrote on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter): "I am appalled by the high number of casualties following the bombing by Israel of the Jabalia refugee camp."[47] UN Secretary-General António Guterres stated he was "appalled" by the attack.[48] The UN Human Rig contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 80 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/31_October_2023_Jabalia_refugee_camp_airstrike responseCode 3 200
