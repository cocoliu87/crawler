Relations became strained once more in 2017 with the Rohingya genocide and due to the 2021 Myanmar coup d'état.[1][2] Myanmar (also known as Burma) has generally maintained warmer relations with near states and is a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

Similarly, the European Union has placed embargoes on Myanmar, including an arms embargo, cessation of trade preferences, and suspension of all aid with the exception of humanitarian aid.[8] US and European government sanctions against the military government, alongside boycotts and other types of direct pressure on corporations by western supporters of the Burmese democracy movement, have resulted in the withdrawal from Myanmar of most US and many European companies. However, several Western companies remain due to loopholes in the sanctions.[9] Asian corporations have generally remained willing to continue investing in Myanmar and to initiate new investments, particularly in natural resource extraction. The French oil company TotalEnergies is able to operate the Yadana natural gas pipeline from Myanmar to Thailand despite the European Union's sanctions on Myanmar. TotalEnergies is currently the subject of a lawsuit in French and Belgian courts for the condoning and use of Burman civilian slavery to construct the named pipeline. Experts[who?] say that the human rights abuses along the gas pipeline are the direct responsibility of TotalEnergies and its American partner Chevron Corporation[citation needed] with aid and implementation by the Tatmadaw. Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Unocal settled a similar human rights lawsuit for a reported multimillion-dollar amount.[10] There remains active debate as to the extent to which the American-led sanctions have had adverse effects on the civilian population or on the military rulers.[11][12] Armenia[edit] Both countries established diplomatic relations on 31 January 2013. Belarus[edit] Myanmar delegation at MILEX-2021 military exhibition. Minsk, Belarus Myanmar delegation at MILEX-2021 military exhibition. Minsk, Belarus Main article: Belarus-Myanmar relations Belarus and Myanmar established diplomatic relations on 22 September 1999.[13] In December 2011, prime minister of Belarus Mikhail Myasnikovich made on official visit to Myanmar.[13] In 2021, Belarus was the only country to vote against UN General Assembly resolution calling Myanmar military to stop violence, release arrested protesters and restore democracy.[14] It was assumed that Belarusian support for Myanmar military junta was caused by long history of arms trade with Myanmar Army.[14] Denmark[edit] Main article: Denmark–Myanmar relations Myanmar is represented in Denmark through its embassy in the United Kingdom,[15] and Denmark is represented in Myanmar through its embassy in Thailand.[16] Diplomatic relations were established in 1955.[17] Relations between the two countries are friendly,[17] but economically, Denmark has the "worst" trade with Myanmar in the European Union.[18] Development assistance to Myanmar is a top priority of the Danish International Development Agency's engagement in Southeast Asia. 93 million DKK was given to education and healthcare projects.[19] Danish development assistance has focused on promoting democracy and human rights. Denmark was one of the first countries to respond to cyclone Nargis by providing humanitarian assistance to Myanmar.[20] Three Diseases Fund was founded in 2006, and Denmark joined in 2009.[21] Three Diseases Fund helps Myanmar fight HIV and AIDS, and has assisted with 73 million dollars.[22] Burmese Consul incident[edit] In 1996, the consul in Myanmar for Denmark, James Leander Nichols, was sentenced to three years in jail. The sentence was for illegal possession of two facsimile machines and a telephone switchboard. Two months later, he died in prison. Despite Danish insistence, Burmese authorities refused to allow an independent autopsy.[23] Soon after, the European Union, with Canada, called for a United Nations gathering on the democratisation process.[24][25] Hungary[edit] In June 2019, Aung San Suu Kyi visited Hungary and meet with the Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. "The two leaders highlighted that one of the greatest challenges at present for both countries and their respective regions – south-east Asia and Europe – is migration", read a statement released after their meeting. it also said "They noted that both regions have seen the emergence of the issue of co-existence with continuously growing Muslim populations".[26][27] Ireland[edit] See also: Foreign relations of Ireland The Government of Ireland established diplomatic relations with Myanmar on a non-resident basis on 10 February 2004. The Irish Government was still concerned about the arbitrary detention of the opposition leader Aun contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 62 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_Myanmar responseCode 3 200
