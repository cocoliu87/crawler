Front page of the Government Gazette of the Greek Government (09/2008) A government gazette (also known as an official gazette, official journal, official newspaper, official monitor or official bulletin) is a periodical publication that has been authorised to publish public or legal notices. It is usually established by statute or official action, and publication of notices within it, whether by the government or a private party, is usually considered sufficient to comply with legal requirements for public notice.[1] Gazettes are published either in print, electronically or both. Publication within privately owned periodicals[edit] In some jurisdictions, privately owned newspapers may also register with the public authorities in order to publish public and legal notices.[2][3][4] Likewise, a private newspaper may be designated by the courts for publication of legal notices. These are referred to as "legally adjudicated newspapers".[5] See also[edit] Wikisource has original text related to this article: Government gazettes List of government gazettes List of British colonial gazettes Journals of legislative bodies Annals Newspaper of record External links[edit] Government gazette of South Africa References[edit] ^ Black's Law Dictionary, 6th edn.
