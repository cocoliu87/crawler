Morgan Building) is a four-story office building in the Financial District of Manhattan in New York City, at the southeast corner of Wall Street and Broad Street. Designed by Trowbridge & Livingston in the neoclassical style and constructed from 1913 to 1914, it was originally the headquarters of J.P. Morgan & Co. Since the late 2000s, the building has remained unoccupied for long periods, although it has occasionally been used for events. The building has a facade of ashlar masonry and pink Tennessee marble. The first floor consists of a piano nobile over a low basement; above are the second story, the main cornice, and two more stories. After its completion, the building became known as the headquarters of J.P. Morgan & Co.—the "House of Morgan"—although its exterior was never signed with the Morgan name. The banking room, which took up nearly the entire ground floor, included offices and was used for banking transactions. This space was designed with a domed, coffered ceiling and, later, a large crystal chandelier. Mechanical systems and vaults were in the basement, and executive offices were placed on the upper floors. 23 Wall Street replaced the Drexel Building, which was the banking headquarters for J.P. Morgan & Co.'s predecessor Drexel, Morgan & Co. When the building was damaged during the Wall Street bombing in 1920, J.P. Morgan & Co. refused to make repairs, in defiance of the bombing's perpetrators. The building was linked to neighboring 15 Broad Street in 1957, and the two buildings served as the J.P. Morgan & Co. headquarters until 1988, when the firm moved to 60 Wall Street. During the 2000s, there were plans to convert both 23 Wall Street and 15 Broad Street into a condominium complex. In 2008, 23 Wall Street was sold to interests associated with the billionaire industrialist Sam Pa but mostly remained empty afterward. Depicted in several media works, 23 Wall Street's simple design was generally praised upon its completion. The building is a New York City designated landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP); it is also a contributing property to the NRHP-listed Wall Street Historic District. Site[edit] 23 Wall Street is in the Financial District of Manhattan in New York City, at the southeast corner of Broad Street to the west and Wall Street to the north.[3] The building's land lot has a frontage of about 113 feet (34 m) along Broad Street and 157 feet (48 m) along Wall Street.[4][5][6] It borders 15 Broad Street to the south and west. Other nearby buildings include the New York Stock Exchange Building to the west; 14 Wall Street to the northwest; Federal Hall National Memorial (formerly the sub-Treasury building) at 26 Wall Street to the north; and 40 Wall Street to the northeast.[3] The Broad Street station of the New York City Subway, serving the J and Z trains, contains entrances directly outside 23 Wall Street.[7] The Second Empire style Drexel Building—the banking headquarters for Drexel, Morgan & Co., predecessor of J.P. Morgan & Co.—previously occupied 23 Wall Street's site.[8][9] That building, completed in 1873,[8] was designed with a mansard roof and marble walls.[10][11][12] Its seven stories had been connected by a steam elevator, one of the city's earliest such installations. The Real Estate Record and Guide characterized the Drexel Building as "the second fireproof building of importance" to be built in New York City, after the Equitable Life Building.[12] Panoramic view of the site with the George Washington statue outside Federal Hall at far left, 23 Wall Street at center left, and the New York Stock Exchange Building at right Architecture[edit] Trowbridge & Livingston designed 23 Wall Street in the neoclassical style.[1][13][14] Marc Eidlitz was the building's main construction contractor,[15][16] though many other engineers and contractors were involved in the building's construction.[16][a] 23 Wall Street was the headquarters of J.P. Morgan & Co., the "House of Morgan", and was nicknamed "The Corner".[17] J. P. Morgan Jr., the head of the bank when the building was being planned, dictated many aspects of its design.[8][15] Unlike skyscrapers in the surrounding area, 23 Wall Street was built with only four above-ground stories.[2][4][18] The building originally contained up to five mezzanine levels, leading Architecture and Building magazine to characterize it as a nine-story building.[4] The building is shaped like an irregular heptagon, with a chamfered corner at its main entrance at Wall and Broad Streets, as well as a "light court" on the building's eastern side at the third and fourth stories.[17][19] The southeast corner contains an extension that protrudes slightly from the southern lot line.[20] The main entrance corner, facing the intersection of Wall, Broad, and Nassau Streets, was intended to make the intersection appear like a public square outside Federal Hall.[8] When the building was being designed, Morgan had stipulated the architects include an entrance at that corner. The acute angle of the intersection led Trowbridge & Livingston to design that entrance as a chamfer, which was more architecturally appealing.[14][21] The facade rises about 85 feet (26 m) above street level. Because of the irregular shape, the building only takes up 92 feet (28 m) on Broad Street and 135 feet (41 m) on Wall Street, or about 20 feet (6.1 m) less than the lot frontage on either side.[6] Facade[edit] Seen in 2010 The facade is made of ashlar masonry and pink Tennessee marble,[22] in accordance with J. P. Morgan Sr.'s request that the marble be identical to that used in his 36th Street residence's library.[8] Each of the marble blocks was laid horizontally, with a cross section of 3 by 3 feet (0.91 by 0.91 m) and a length of 7 to 22 feet (2.1 to 6.7 m).[4][23][24] To furnish the marble for the project, the Morgans used their own quarry in Knoxville, Tennessee.[17][24] The walls are astylar in design, with unadorned windows in deep reveals.[1][14] The facade contains several divots caused by flying shrapnel from the Wall Street bombing, which occurred outside the building in 1920.[13][25] The first floor consists of a high piano nobile over a low basement. Above that are a shorter second story and the windowless third story; the fourth story is set back and not visible from street level. The main cornice, between the second and third stories, is inspired by Italian Renaissance architecture and wraps around the north, northwest, and west sides. A mechanical penthouse containing air-conditioning machinery is atop the original roof.[18] The main entrance is through the chamfered corner at Wall and Broad Streets;[22] the building's corner measures 34 feet (10 m) wide.[6] A short flight of five steps leads from the sidewalk to the large rectangular entrance opening, which is slightly recessed from the facade. The entrance opening contains a bronze-and-glass set of doors underneath a transom window made of bronze and glass. On either side of the entrance opening, the chamfered corner's walls are designed to resemble pilasters.[18] The senior Morgan had stipulated that no company name signs would be on either of the pilasters, as he planned to add decorative elements, but he died before the plans were finalized.[8] Ultimately, no name plaque was ever placed atop the main entrance, as the building became well known worldwide.[26][27] The lintel above the doorway is a single continuous stone measuring 19 by 3.16 by 4 feet (6 by 1 by 1 m) and was, at the time of the building's construction, one of the largest stones ever brought to New York City.[15] Above the main entrance, at the second story, there is a single set of three windows.[18] According to The New York Times, the main entrance was sometimes also known by the building's nickname, "The Corner".[28] The remainders of the Wall and Broad Street facades are similar, except that the Broad Street facade has four vertical bays, and the Wall Street facade has five. In each bay, there is a tall rectangular window opening at ground level, as well as a pair of smaller openings at the mezzanine.[18] Each of the ground-story windows measures 22 feet (6.7 m) tall and 12 feet (3.7 m) wide.[4] There were also window openings at the basement level, subsequently infilled with marble.[18] Another entrance on Broad Street led to the wire transfer department in the building's basement.[29] Features[edit] Substructure and basement[edit] The foundations of the outer walls were made of cofferdams that extended 65 feet (20 m) into the underlying bedrock.[23][30] The concrete used in the cofferdams was laid 7 feet (2.1 m) thick.[4] The perimeter of the site was excavated with pneumatic caissons averaging about 7 by 28 feet (2.1 by 8.5 m), after which the center of the lot was excavated to a depth of 55 feet (17 m).[31][32] The foundations were built to be strong enough to support a tower of at least 30 stories.[23][33] The basement was accessed through an elevator and stairs in the rear of the ground story, as well as through the sec contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 48 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/23_Wall_Street responseCode 3 200
