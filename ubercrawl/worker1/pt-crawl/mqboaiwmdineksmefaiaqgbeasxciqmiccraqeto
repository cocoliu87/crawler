" it's possible that all the copied text was originally written by the nominator" the copied text seems to come from the nominator's 30 August 2023 rewrite of National Reconciliation (Sudan). Rjjiii (talk) 03:16, 4 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] good catch, dying! have pulled :) theleekycauldron (talk • she/her) 07:15, 4 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] @Theleekycauldron given how this conversation went (see dying response and mine below), are you going to put it back? FuzzyMagma (talk) 07:21, 5 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] @FuzzyMagma: done :) theleekycauldron (talk • she/her) 05:56, 6 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] @Dying to add to the previous point " it's possible that all the copied text was originally written by the nominator". The text you mentioned was moved not copied and expanded way beyond what beyond the version that you used in earwig. How about you do the earwig analysis with the current version of September 1983 Laws and if you reach the same conclusion, I am happy for the hook to go FuzzyMagma (talk) 07:52, 4 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Btw you can just click on both articles stats and see who is main contributor so you will to know if “ that all the copied text was originally written by the nominator”. You did the crazy bit of comparing two old versions of two different articles why not do the easy bit too FuzzyMagma (talk) 08:01, 4 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] if it's established that September 1983 Laws is at least 80% new text, this nomination can go forward. theleekycauldron (talk • she/her) 08:07, 4 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] If that is the rule even when I wrote both articles around similar time and decided the split when one ran too broad while nominating one and leaving the other; then I guess I will wait for the article to pass GA FuzzyMagma (talk) 08:14, 4 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] @FuzzyMagma: if you split the text less than seven days after publishing to mainspace, it's still new if you nominate within seven days of putting it in mainspace? theleekycauldron (talk • she/her) 08:18, 4 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] I moved the Nation Reconciliation article to the mainspace on 13 October and the September 1983 Laws article was created on 16 October. So yes less than 7 days FuzzyMagma (talk) 08:23, 4 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] oh, i completely missed that the "National Reconciliation (Sudan)" article was moved to mainspace shortly before the article was split! thanks for pointing that out, FuzzyMagma. also, although the article was moved to mainspace just over a week before the nomination, i'm happy to let that slide. interestingly, the "National Reconciliation (Sudan)" article wasn't actually the article i had first compared the nominated article with; i only ended up stumbling upon that after a bit of digging. i think what had first caught my eye was the similarity between the nominated article with the "Islamism in Sudan" article. the latter article was first created in mainspace in 2020. according to this earwig comparison, there seems to be more than a 20% overlap between these two articles. if the overlap with "Sudanese Greeks" (here) and "Legal system of Sudan" (here) are also taken into account, it seems as if expanding the nominated article to satisfy the fivefold expansion requirement at this point would be difficult to achieve. apologies for the confusion caused by using the comparison with the "National Reconciliation (Sudan)" article. at the time, it looked like presenting that comparison would have made the issue more obvious. dying (talk) 09:59, 4 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] No worries. Just for clarification, I was the one who expanded the Islamism in Sudan article from a stub to the existing size (by 90.2%) starting from 31 August 2023 and did not nominate the article as it relayed on one source and I need to improve so it can fit the front page. The text the might have started all of this, as you said, was copied later on 20 October from the September 1983 Laws and not the other way around. FuzzyMagma (talk) 10:38, 4 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] i'm sorry, FuzzyMagma, it looks like you misinterpreted what i was trying to say. the date that the "National Reconciliation (Sudan)" article was moved to mainspace is irrelevant because the copied material previously appeared in the "Islamism in Sudan" article. if only the date that the "National Reconciliation (Sudan)" article was moved to mainspace mattered, then editors can effectively renew text copied from other articles by first copying the text to an intermediary article in draftspace first. i'm not sure why you provided the diff dated 2023.10.20. the only substantial text copied there appears to be an accidental duplication of some caption text into the prose, which you later removed anyway in this diff. i suppose you could say that the text was copied from the "September 1983 Laws" article to the "Islamism in Sudan" article, but that's simply because it was already in both articles before you duplicated it in the "Islamism in Sudan" article. in any case, the duplicated caption text wasn't what initially caught my eye anyway. the comparison i provided in my last comment between the "September 1983 Laws" and "Islamism in Sudan" articles was based on the latest versions at the time because you had requested that i compare the then-current versions in your earlier comments. to make more clear what text was copied, here is a comparison between the current "September 1983 Laws" article and the "Islamism in Sudan" article at the time the "September 1983 Laws" article was created. this comparison clearly shows that more than 20% of the current text in the "September 1983 Laws" article had already appeared in mainspace before the article was created. i think it is possible that you had actually copied the text in question from a different article, or even from an offline draft, but had lost track of what text you were copying to which articles, and didn't realize when you created the new "September 1983 Laws" article that you had already copied much of the text to the old "Islamism in Sudan" article more than a month earlier. if so, that would explain why you may not have realized that this article contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 61 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Did_you_know responseCode 3 200
