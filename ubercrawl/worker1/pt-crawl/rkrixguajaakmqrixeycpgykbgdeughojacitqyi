She was at the brink of being taken over by domestic communists supported by the victors of the Continuation War. It may be theoretically true, but if so, it's a misleading factoid, as it emphasizes less relevant information but supresses the more relevant. Furthermore, even factoid on a "declaration of war" may be true - or not - but as the relevant link to the Lapland War is missing, and as the relevant dates for the war (September 19th for the commitment, November for start of hot combats, April for conclusion) are omitted (there is, admittedly, not much space) the result of these strange notions is nothing but confusion for the reader. In any case, it's hard to understand why such informations are omitted in the relevant article. sincerely /ML— Preceding unsigned comment added by 212.181.86.76 (talk) 21:47, 10 April 2004 (UTC)Reply[reply] Layout[edit] I have put a general comment on year layout on my talk page, particularly on the way year by topic is dealt with. There are three different variants and I would like agreement to standardise. This would involve deleting the year by topic from the paragraph list on this page but keeping the box at the topBozMo(talk)—Preceding undated comment added by BozMo (talk • contribs) 14:04, 5 May 2004 (UTC)Reply[reply] Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki[edit] I think the information about the Hiroshima and Nagasaki could be shortened. I do not wish to hide the facts. But every other entry is way much shorter. In a list such as this one we do not need to discuss whether Nagasaki was the primary target or not. My proposal: August 6 - World War II: The United States detonates an atomic bomb nicknamed "Little Boy" on Hiroshima, Japan at 8:16 AM (local time). August 9 - World War II: The United States detonates an atomic bomb nicknamed "Fat Man" over the city of Nagasaki, Japan at 11:02 AM (local time). World War II: The Soviet Union begins its offensive against Japan in the then Japanese controlled Chinese region of Manchuria. [1] --itpastorn 16:39, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC) Isn't this page subject to some sort of neutrality? How come that during WWII Soviet forces have "found concentration camps", "occupied Warshaw" and "invaded Austria" (which was not even part of soviet block afterwards, btw) and allied forces "liberated concentration camps" number of times; and "liberated", "seized" and "landed on" and "recaptured" number of places. So bad all evil in this world hates them for their freedom...—Preceding unsigned comment added by Lelik (talk • contribs) 03:08, 20 January 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] 7th of August: I doubt that Truman meant Nagasaki—Preceding unsigned comment added by Wikibert~enwiki (talk • contribs) 20:19, 5 August 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply] - In response to recent vandalism, I would like to elect this page for an edit-lock.

I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in this Wikipedia article constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. If there is other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page. Note that any fair use images lacking such an explanation can be deleted one week after being tagged, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page. Thank you.
