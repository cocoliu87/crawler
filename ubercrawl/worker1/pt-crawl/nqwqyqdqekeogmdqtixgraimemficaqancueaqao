Thanks. Archived discussion for September 2006 from Wikipedia:In the news section on the Main Page/Candidates. September 30 Gol Transportes Aéreos Flight 1907, crashed in the rural state of Mato Grosso[1] it is unknown if there are any survivors it could be Brazil's worst air disaster, 155 people were on board Mieciu K 09:36, 30 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Add. Article has been created, crash has been confirmed and wreckage found, passenger manifest has been released. If no survivors, definitely worst incident in Brazilian aviation history. Fvasconcellos 15:00, 30 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Yes definte add now. Per above. Very important current event. Hello32020 15:18, 30 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] I have added it, but without definite reports on the survivors, I am current reluctant to add that it could be Brazil's worst air disaster. Zzyzx11 (Talk) 15:50, 30 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] The West Coast Eagles defeat the Sydney Swans to win the 2006 AFL Grand Final by 1 point. The sport has the third highest attendance of any sport on Earth, if this news is not noteworthy then I don't know what is. That's a touch misleading; the *average* attendance is the third highest, and that ignores a lot of auto racing. --Golbez 08:06, 30 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] The average is what matters because theres over 200million people in the united states, and only 20million in Australia. Also, the sport is one of the oldest in the world, its more than 40 years since a grand final has been decided by a point, its the most popular sport in australia with the highest attendances of any sport in australia, has the highest average attendances of any other sport in the southern hemesphere, and there are corruption allegations against AFL officials including umpires that sydney was earmarked to be given the 2005 & 2006 grand finals, yet the opposition in west coast eagles were still able to win. There has been much debate over whether sporting events, especially ones that do not have international clout (such as the UEFA Champion's League, the Super Bowl, and the Stanley Cup), should be posted here on ITN (see the archived discussion). So I apologise if there is reluctance to also post the AFL Grand Final too. Thanks. Zzyzx11 (Talk) 08:29, 30 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] I totally understand, there has to be consistancy though, I remember a hockey thing being in the news and at the moment, golf (the ryder cup) is on there, here in australia its as big as the Melbourne Cup. The above suggestion fails ITN, because it fails to link to a "current event" article. My suggestion is: The West Coast Eagles defeat the Sydney Swans by 1 point to win the 2006 Australian Football League Grand Final. Daniel.Bryant 10:12, 30 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Perhaps have something like the "The 2006 AFL and NRL seasons end in Australia" put up tomorrow night. Also, the UEFA Champion's League should go up, its heavily followed.--HamedogTalk|@ 09:26, 30 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] The AFL Grand Final should be put up. Was the Soccer world cup put up? If it was this should be to. Due to the fact that it is an Australian sport. Its not suitbale since it has little to no international significance.--Peta 10:53, 30 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] That is not true at all. Australian Rules has become a worldwide sport with national leagues in Canada, US, UK, New Zealand, Japan etc. The game itself was broadcasted to every continent for everyone to watch. It truly does have international significance and it should be posted.--c4v3m4n 07:23, 1 October 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] September 29 A Brazilian Gol Transportes Aéreos flight with 155 passengers onboard, has disappeared from radar, after coliding with a smaller jet in midair, 470 miles south of Manaus. Defintely needed, not much info at the moment though Hello32020 01:12, 30 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] I'd hold off adding it the template until we know where it has gone, if it hasn't crashed it's not really news, plus there is not much there at the moment.--Peta 01:13, 30 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Yeah it could wait till more info is available. I'm going to be going to bed soon though, so...Hello32020 01:15, 30 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Add per [2] Hello32020 02:35, 30 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] There is still no article and nobody knows what happened yet (or even how many people there were on board, I've seen estimates beteen 140 - 155), this does not meet the criteria for ITN yet.--Peta 02:38, 30 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Typhoon Xangsane lashes the northern Philippines, killing at least 28 people and causing extensive damage. --Peta 04:50, 29 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Is there enough content around to make a seperate Typhoon Xangsane (2006) article about it like Hurricane Ioke and Typhoon Saomai (2006)? Zzyzx11 (Talk) 04:54, 29 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Linking the summary pages has been done before, the cyclone wikiproject people are in the best position to decide to make a new article. Its one of the top international stories on google news atm.--Peta 05:00, 29 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Alright, I will put it on for now. Zzyzx11 (Talk) 05:04, 29 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] September 28 The remains of Empress Maria Fyodorovna are returned from Denmark to Russia and re-interred in the Peter and Paul Cathedral of Saint Petersburg, next to her husband, Tsar Alexander III, 78 years after her death. --64.229.221.217 10:08, 28 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Posted.

Zzyzx11 (Talk) 21:47, 28 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Why? No international significance whatsoever. --Golbez 22:31, 28 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Seems presumptuous when there are articles on BBC news and other international sources. Of course the same agrument could be made about posting the Dawson College shooting on ITN. [3] Zzyzx11 (Talk) 22:39, 28 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Of course the BBC had it, school shootings are gold for the news - but that doesn't make them inherently encyclopedic. And don't get me started on the bad spinach. --Golbez 17:11, 29 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] By the way, Wikipedia:In the news section on the Main Page says entries "should be a story of an international importance, or at least interest" (my emphasis added). This was a slow news day...would you rather have ITN not be updated for several days? (See also PFHLai's comment [4])Zzyzx11 (Talk) 22:45, 28 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Shootings happen all the time in the US. I dont see the significance. Rafy 00:46, 29 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Well, like PFHLai's comment I cited, I am willing to replace it if I find anything other significantly new to put on ITN. Thanks. Zzyzx11 (Talk) 00:55, 29 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] September 26 Emmanuel Milingo, the Archbishop of Lusaka, is excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church by Pope Benedict XVI for consecrating clerical marriages. -- Solipsist 21:06, 26 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] I've editted the entry for clarity. —Cuiviénen 21:12, 28 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Posted. Zzyzx11 (Talk) 21:47, 28 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] A European Commission report confirms Bulgaria and Romania's date of accession to the European Union, 1 January 2007. If this is to appear on the Main Page, it should be after the report is officially presented this afternoon. Its contents are already widely known (BBC, EuroNews), however. Also, "Bulgaria" and "Romania" may also link to Accession of Bulgaria to the European Union and Accession of Romania to the European Union, not sure how appropriate it would be. Todor→Bozhinov 11:51, 26 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Agree. Let's wait for the official announcement, as per WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. However, it's okay to draft a line on this page here for use on ITN later. -- PFHLai 12:31, 26 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] That's right :) But as the main part is absolutely clear already and it only needs to be formally confirmed, I've posted it here so we could put in on the Main Page as soon as the report is officially unveiled. In case we need a picture, the European flag or even better, this map, would fit well. Todor→Bozhinov 12:53, 26 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] The report's currently being unveiled and José Manuel Durão Barroso, President of the European Commission, has confirmed the date in his opening speech, so we can put it on the Main Page now as official (Focus News). Todor→Bozhinov 13:25, 26 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Enlargement of the European Union, Accession of Bulgaria to the European Union and Accession of Romania to the European Union could use a touch of updating. (e.g. On Sep.26th, 2006, the EC announced that ....) -- 199.71.174.100 17:15, 26 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Done! Todor→Bozhinov 17:45, 26 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Are we waiting for 1 January 2007? This can replace the Ryder Cup. -- 64.229.205.204 16:09, 29 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] Shinzo Abe Japan's Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi steps down; Shinzo Abe replaces him. --Peta 04:13, 26 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] I would prefer more content than the brief one paragraph mention that is currently on Junichiro Koizumi. Zzyzx11 (Talk) 09:13, 26 September 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply] More can be found on Shinzo Abe's page. -- PFHLai 12:31,  contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 81 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Wikipedia:In_the_news/Candidates/September_2006 responseCode 3 200
