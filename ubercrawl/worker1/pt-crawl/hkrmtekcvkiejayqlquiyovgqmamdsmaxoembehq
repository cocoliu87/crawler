Personnel Abu Jamal (Arabic: أبو جمال, romanized: Abū Jamāl) is the kunya (nom de guerre) of a Palestinian militant commander who is the spokeperson for the organization.[4][5] History Originally named the Red Eagle Brigade (Arabic: كتائب النسر الأحمر, romanized: Katā’ib al-Nasr al-Aḥmar), they were renamed in 2001 after Abu Ali Mustafa, PFLP's leader, who was killed by Israel in August 2001. They were active with attacks on both military and civilian Israeli targets during the al-Aqsa Intifada. On 16 July 2007, Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas requested that all Palestinian resistance groups relinquish their weapons to the Palestinian Authority. Although several members of Fatah's armed wing Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades complied, the Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades rejected this, stating that they will not cease their resistance until the Israelis withdraw from all parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades fought in the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis.[6] Attacks carried out by the Brigades See also: List of Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine suicide attacks The PFLP's Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades has carried out attacks on both civilians and military targets during the Al-Aqsa Intifada.

Its known weaponry includes small arms, light machine guns, rocket artillery, mortars, man-portable surface-to-air missiles, improvised weapons, and explosives, including IEDs, and suicide vests.[15] The Brigades also produces its own weaponry alongside smuggling and importing it. These include IEDs, mortars, and rockets, alongside others. The Samoud-1 (literally "resilience") is a relatively short range (12-20kms) rocket domestically produced by Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades in the Gaza Strip.[16] Foreign support The PFLP, and by extension the Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades, receive military and financial support by Iran. This relationship probably began around 2013, and although the actual extent of this support is unclear, the PFLP and Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades have repeatedly declared themselves allies of Iran, Syria and the Axis of Resistance.[17][18] See also Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine Revolutionary People's Liberation Party/Front Syrian Resistance References ^ "Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (1) Archived 2011-10-17 at the Wayback Machine."
