A series of cricket competitions determined which countries took part in the 2023 Cricket World Cup. In total, 32 countries took part in the qualification process, from which 10 teams qualified for the World Cup. The 32 teams were divided into three leagues—Super League (13 teams), League 2 (7 teams) and Challenge League (12 teams). Based on the results of the leagues, teams either directly qualify for the World Cup, were eliminated from World Cup qualification, or advanced to other supplementary qualifying tournaments through which they could qualify for the World Cup. The supplementary qualifying tournaments also determined the promotion and relegation between the leagues. As it was the first use of the new process, teams were allocated to the three leagues based on their ICC member status, ODI status and rank from the 2017–2019 ICC World Cricket League.[1] Overview[edit] A diagram that explains the qualification structure for the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup As with the previous edition, the 2023 World Cup featured ten teams. The main route for qualification was the 2020–23 Super League tournament. From the thirteen competitors in this tournament, the top seven sides plus the hosts (India) qualified for the World Cup. The remaining five teams, along with five Associate sides, proceeded to the 2023 qualifier, from which two teams went through to the final tournament.[2][3] Means of qualification Date Venue Berths Teams Host Nation — — 1 India Super League 30 July 2020 – 14 May 2023 Various 7 Afghanistan Australia Bangladesh England New Zealand Pakistan South Africa Qualifier 18 June – 9 July 2023 Zimbabwe 2 Netherlands Sri Lanka Total 10 Teams were eliminated from World Cup qualification as follows: Tournament Date Venue Eliminations Teams Challenge League 16 September 2019 – 14 December 2022 Various 10 Bermuda Denmark Hong Kong Italy Kenya Malaysia Qatar Singapore Uganda Vanuatu Qualifier Play-off 24 March – 5 April 2023 Namibia 4 Canada Jersey Namibia Papua New Guinea Qualifier 18 June – 9 July 2023 Zimbabwe 8 Ireland Nepal Oman Scotland United Arab Emirates United States West Indies Zimbabwe Total 22 Qualifying leagues[edit] Super League[edit] Main article: 2020–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League League Outcome Qualification Berths Teams Host Nation 1 India Qualified for World Cup 7 Afghanistan Australia Bangladesh England New Zealand Pakistan South Africa Advanced to Qualifier 5 Ireland Netherlands Sri Lanka West Indies Zimbabwe Total 13 Pos Team v t e Pld W L NR Ded Pts NRR Progress to 1 New Zealand 24 16 5 3 0 175 0.914 2023 Cricket World Cup[a] 2 England 24 15 8 1 0 155 0.976 3 Bangladesh 24 15 8 1 0 155 0.220 4 Australia 24 15 9 0 0 150 0.785 5 Afghanistan 18 14 3 1 0 145 0.573 6 India 21 13 6 2 1 139[b] 0.782 7 Pakistan 21 13 8 0 0 130 0.108 8 South Africa 24 9 13 2 2 98[c] −0.077 9 West Indies 24 9 15 0 2 88[d] −0.738 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier 10 Sri Lanka 24 7 14 3 4 81[e] −0.369 11 Ireland 24 6 15 3 2 73[f] −0.357 12 Zimbabwe 24 6 17 1 0 65 −0.952 13 Netherlands 24 3 20 1 0 35 −1.179 Source: ICC[12], ESPN Cricinfo[13] The series between Afghanistan and India, and Afghanistan and Pakistan were not played (or awarded to either side).
