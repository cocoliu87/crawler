Its main mission is to infiltrate the territory of Israel, with specific attention to Galilee and northern Israel.[1] Hezbollah has trained special forces fighters since the 1990s, which are today part of the Radwan Unit. They have particular experience in raids and small unit tactics[2] and according to Hezbollah perform "ambushes, assassinations, or operations that require deep infiltration."[3] The unit, established in 2008, serves as organisational and operational basis for specialist units of Hezbollah. According to several sources, the involvement into the Syrian civil war granted Hezbollah in general, and the Radwan Force in particular, significant battlefield experience and combat arms coordination at a larger scale.[4] According to Israeli researcher Dima Adamsky, the cooperation with advanced regular armed forces in Syria enabled the Radwan Force to transition from advanced infantry to commando force, capable to achieve significant operational and strategic effects in a war against Israel.[5] Name[edit] Before April 2008, the Hezbollah special unit was known as the “Rapid Intervention Force” or the “Intervention Unit”. After the murder of Imad Fayez Mughniyeh, alias al-Hajj Radwan, the unit was renamed after the alias of Mughniyeh’s operational name, Hajj Radwan (الحاج رضوان).[1][6] Mission[edit] Radwan Force is the Hezbollah’s special unit, whose main mission is to infiltrate into Israeli territory, conquer Israeli territories and settlements in the Galilee.[1] Alongside the actual invasion of Galilee, the Radwan Force is tasked to carry out reconnaissance and intelligence operations against Israeli targets by UAVs.[7] History[edit] The predecessor of the Radwan Force was known as the “Intervention Unit”. It was a veteran organic unit that was part of combat apparatus of Hezbollah. It functioned as a special offensive force tasked to assist Hezbollah’s territorial units. The “Intervention Unit” was commanded by Haytham Ali Tabataba’i.[1] The unit was responsible for the capture of the Israeli soldiers in July 2006 that led to the outbreak of the 2006 Lebanon War. The preparations for the capture and the operation itself were carried out under then-commander’s direct command.[1] The Radwan Force, which was established with the assistance of the IRGC Quds Force, was integrated into the existing “Intervention Unit”.[1] Exposure[edit] The Radwan Force was revealed in the Ashura ceremonies in 2014 in the Dahiya neighborhood of Beirut. On this occasion, militants of a distinct unit were photographed while providing security to the ceremonies.[1] At this time, the Radwan Force was allegedly commanded by a man named Muhammad Ali Hamadi.[1][8] Involvement in the Syrian civil war[edit] The Radwan Force has been involved into the Syrian civil war since 2015-2016 as a support to Syrian government and was stationed in Aleppo area.[1] Radwan Force also contributed to battles of al-Qusayr and of al-Qalamoun, being decisive for government's victory on these occasions.[1] According to Tal Beeri, after the end of the main phases of the Syrian civil war, troops of the Radwan Force are garrisoned in northern Syria, as well as in Saraqib in Idlib Governorate. In this area, the Radwan Force operates in close coordination with Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba and Liwa Fatemiyoun,[1] but suffered significant casualities against regular Turkish Armed Forces.[9] The Radwan Force area of operations also includes the Quneitra Governorate and Daraa, integrated with the Syrian Arab Army and Shiite militias. In the South, the Radwan Force cooperates with the 4th Armoured Division,[1] and with the Russian Naval Infantry Unit 810.[10] In May 2017, Radwan Unit was allegedly withdrawn from Syria and redeployed on in southern Lebanon.[11] 2023 Israel–Hamas war[edit] Since the outbreak of the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, Hezbollah has transferred medical teams and significant forces of the Radwan Force on the Syrian-Israeli border.[12] Organisation[edit] According to Tal Beeri, the Radwan Force consists of around 2,500 troops.[1][6] Under the Radwan Force command, several small, squad-level sub-units (Arabic: شُعبة, romanized: Shu’aba, lit. 'Section') operate autonomously. Each sub-unit amounts to 7-10 militants based in Shiite villages in Lebanon. These villages function as logisitical reference points for squads. Squads are garrisoned in the vicinity of villages, with ammunition and self-sustainment supplies stored for emergencies.[7] While being garrisoned near amicable villages, militants are kept separated from civilian population.[6] This organisation allows squad commanders to operate with significant tactical autonomy, without being dependent on external (and insecure) logistical assistance.[1] Additionally, the unit consists of combat engineers who, apart from military training, are also trained in cyber and information gathering fields.[7] According to Einav Halabi, three psychological care facilities operate in southern Lebanon in order to assist Radwan Force members.[6] Selection and training[edit] Militants are admitted into the Radwan Force after a careful vetting process. Training begins only after the screening procedure.[1] Training includes sniper training, anti-tank warfare, hand-to-hand combat, explosives training, tactical driving, as well as training for special forces. This latter variety of training includes a “captivity workshop”, in order to teach the trainee to behave in case of capture, and operation of intelligence-gathering UAVs.[1] The Radwan Force’s training also emphasizes physical fitness, long-distance running, mountain navigation, and tactical warfare. The unit’s operatives receive training directly from the IRGC-GF Saberin Unit.[1] Equipment[edit] A militant of the Radwan Force. According to Tal Beeri, the Radwan Force has access to all weapons in Hezbollah's arsenal which may be relevant for its operations, including every weapon pertaining to infantry and commando warfare available on the arms market. Combat accessories, including of Western and Russian origin,[8] are also used.[1] The Radwan Force employs small, highly mobile units on motorcycles, quad bikes, and light all-terrain vehicles equipped with Russian-made Kornet ATGMs.[13] Uniforms[edit] On the occasion of their exposure in 2014, militants of the Radwan Force wore black uniforms, helmets, balaclavas, and dark goggles concealing their features and were armed with assault rifles typical of commando units.[1] See also[edit] Hezbollah armed strength 2006 Lebanon War References[edit] ^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s Beeri, Tal (5 January 2023).
