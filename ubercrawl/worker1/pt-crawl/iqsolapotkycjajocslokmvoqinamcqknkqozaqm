Shelling of the town intensified before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and fighting began in the town on 17 March.[9][failed verification] By November 2022, much of the town was destroyed, with no civilians remaining and few buildings left standing from the fighting.[10][2] Prelude[edit] In June 2015, Marinka was the site of a one-day battle in which Ukrainian forces held back a DPR attack. The city remained on the front line throughout the duration of the war in Donbass.[citation needed] On 17 February, shelling in Marinka injured a 65-year-old woman.[11][12] Civilians recounted that shelling on this day had begun around 9:30 AM, and ended at 2:30 PM, saying they had heard "at least 20" separate explosions.[11] Shelling intensified in the days leading up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, killing two Ukrainian soldiers and injuring four more.[13] Battle[edit] On 24 March, Ukrainian officials claimed to have repelled Russian assaults in Marinka.[14] On 30-31 March, Ukrainian emergency services extinguished "dozens of fires" that had started in the town because of white phosphorus munitions from Russian forces.[9] In mid-April, during the beginning of the battle of Donbas, Russian and DPR forces ramped up offensive operations, launching multiple attacks on Marinka.[15] On 17 April, one person was killed after Russian forces shelled the city.[16] Two days later on 19 April, Ukrainian forces regained control of Marinka after a failed Russian assault the day prior.[17][18] Ukrainian forces repelled Russian attacks on the town on the 23rd, 25th[failed verification], and 26th[failed verification] of April.[17][19] The ISW reported on 20 May that Russian and DPR forces had refocused their efforts towards Marinka, having allocated additional forces following the end of the siege of Mariupol.[20] Throughout May, southern[failed verification] Marinka shifted between Ukrainian and Russian control as fighting intensified.[21] Further Russian assaults on 25 June were repelled by Ukraine.[22] The Russian Ministry of Defence claimed[failed verification] on 3 July that Ukraine's 54th Mechanized Brigade has lost "more than 60% of its personnel and equipment" during clashes in Marinka, although these claims could not be verified.[23] Fighting intensified from mid-July through early August, beginning[citation needed] with a failed Russian attack on Marinka on 11 July.[24] Two more assaults occurred on 30 July and 1 August, with little success.[25][26] On 5 August, DPR and Wagner forces claimed to control half of Marinka.[27] Russian forces assaulted Marinka again on 25 August, although made no gains.[28] Throughout August, Russian forces made incremental gains in Marinka.[29] The ISW reported that the frontline in Marinka largely stagnated throughout September.[30] In October, geolocated footage showed Russian troops had advanced around the C051101 highway north of Marinka.[31] Starting in early November, fighting intensified again with pro-Russian sources claiming marginal gains in the town, although providing no visual evidence.[32] By 13 December, Russian forces controlled 70% of Marinka, with Ukrainian forces controlling the western half of the town past Druzhba Street.[33] DPR president Denis Pushilin claimed that Russian forces would "soon" take control of Marinka.[34] Donetsk Oblast governor Pavlo Kyrylenko stated on 22 December that Marinka and the surrounding areas were "unlivable," and that there was "not a single surviving house."[35] On 24 December, the Russian Ministry of Defence claimed to have made gains inside Marinka, although Ukrainian forces are deeply entrenched inside the center of the town.[citation needed] In January 2023, interviewed Ukrainian soldiers stated that fighting in Marinka was "hellish," and that with virtually no buildings left standing, they were fighting out of basements, rubble, and behind freestanding walls.[36] On 30 January, Ukraine's 79th Brigade claimed it had repelled an infantry assault by a company of Russian troops towards Marinka.[37] On February 8, former Deputy Interior Minister of the Vitaly Kiselev clarified that elements of the 150th Motorized Rifle Division were consolidating positions in parts of western Marinka.[38] According to the Ukrainian General Staff, clashes intensified on February 2 with thirteen battles lasting two hours in Marinka.[39] On February 21, further Russian assaults on Marinka were repelled.[40] Analysis by the British Ministry of Defence claimed that the effects of the Russian winter offensive were inconclusive in Marinka, with only minimal gains captured despite "expending significant resources."[1] Russian media announced in April that Ukrainian forces were pushed back by the Russian Army to the western outskirts of Marinka, where clashes were ongoing.[41] On April 15, Ukrainian general Oleksandr Tarnavskyi released video of six captured Russian soldiers near Marinka.[42] On 24 May, Ukraine's General Staff said Marinka remained one of the epicenters of ongoing clashes during the war.[43] On 31 May, Ramzan Kadyrov, leader of the Chechen Kadyrovite forces fighting in Ukraine, stated that his forces had been transferred to the Marinka front, including "Akhmat" Special Forces and the "Sever-Akhmat" Special Purpose Regiment.[4] By 13 July, Kadyrov had announced that Chechen forces would be leaving Marinka for different sectors of the front line.[5] Ukrainian soldiers on the front in Marinka in June claimed that Russian soldiers outnumbered Ukrainians 4:1 in manpower, and 6:1 in artillery.[44] Most battles took place at close range, and in basements.[45] It was reported on 13 July 2023 that Ukrainian forces had captured a Russian-held position in the "Zverinets" fortifications on the Avdiivka–Donetsk line near Marinka.[5] Humanitarian impact[edit] All of Marinka was destroyed in the fighting.[33][46][1] By  contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 74
