Early life and education Adele Laurie Blue Adkins[8] was born on 5 May 1988 in the Tottenham district of London, to an English mother, Penny Adkins, and a Welsh father, Marc Evans.[9] After Evans left when Adele was 2, she was brought up by her mother.[10][11] She began singing at age 4 and asserts that she became obsessed with voices.[12][13] In 1997, 9-year-old Adele and her mother, who by then had found work as a furniture maker and an adult-learning activities organiser, relocated to Brighton on the south coast of England.[14] In 1999, Adele and her mother moved back to London; first to Brixton, then to the neighbouring district of West Norwood in south London, which is the subject of her first song "Hometown Glory".[15] Adele spent much of her youth in Brockwell Park where she would play the guitar and sing to friends, which she recalled in her 2015 song "Million Years Ago". She stated, "It has quite monumental moments of my life that I've spent there, and I drove past it [in 2015] and I just literally burst into tears. I really missed it."[16] Adele graduated from the BRIT School for Performing Arts & Technology in Croydon in May 2006,[17] where she was a classmate of Leona Lewis and Jessie J.[8][18] Adele credits the school with nurturing her talent[19] even though, at the time, she was more interested in going into artists and repertoire (A&R) and hoped to launch other people's careers.[8] Career 2006–2010: Career beginnings and 19 Adele performing on an acoustic guitar in Kilburn, London, in 2007 Four months after graduation, Adele published two songs on the fourth issue of the online arts publication PlatformsMagazine.com.[20] She had recorded a three-song demo for a class project and given it to a friend.[8] The friend posted the demo on Myspace, where it became very successful and led to a phone call from Richard Russell, director of the music label XL Recordings. She doubted if the offer was real because the only record company she knew was Virgin Records, and she took a friend with her to the meeting.[18][21] Around this time, Adele collaborated with Ricsta on "Be Divine", a song described as an "electronic club-ready" track.[22] Nick Huggett, at XL, recommended Adele to manager Jonathan Dickins at September Management, and in June 2006, Dickins became her official representative.[23] September was managing Jamie T at the time and this proved a major draw for Adele, a big fan of the British singer-songwriter. Huggett then signed Adele to XL in September 2006.[23] Adele provided vocals for Jack Peñate's song, "My Yvonne," for his debut album, and it was during this session she first met producer Jim Abbiss, who would go on to produce both the majority of her debut album, 19, and tracks on 21.[24] In June 2007, Adele made her television debut, performing "Daydreamer" on the BBC's Later... with Jools Holland.[25] Adele's breakthrough song, "Hometown Glory", written when she was 16, was released in October 2007.[23] By 2008, Adele had become the headliner and performed an acoustic set, in which she was supported by Damien Rice.[26] She became the first recipient of the Brit Awards Critics' Choice and was named the number-one predicted breakthrough act of 2008 in an annual BBC poll of music critics, Sound of 2008.[27][28] She released her second single, "Chasing Pavements", on 14 January 2008, two weeks ahead of her debut album. The song reached number two on the UK Chart, and stayed there for four weeks.[29] The album 19, named for her age at the time she wrote and composed many of its songs, entered the British charts at number one. The Times Encyclopedia of Modern Music named 19 an "essential" blue-eyed soul recording.[30] Adele was nominated for a 2008 Mercury Prize award for 19.[31] She also won an Urban Music Award for "Best Jazz Act,"[32] and a Music of Black Origin (MOBO) nomination in the category of Best UK Female.[33] In March 2008, Adele signed a deal with Columbia Records and XL Recordings for her foray into the United States.[34] She embarked on a short North American tour in the same month,[34] and 19 was released in the US in June.[19] Billboard magazine stated of it: "Adele truly has potential to become among the most respected and inspiring international artists of her generation."[35] The An Evening with Adele world tour began in May 2008 and ended in June 2009.[36] Adele performing live in January 2009 Adele later cancelled the 2008 US tour dates to be with a former boyfriend.[37] She said in Nylon magazine in June 2009, "I'm like, 'I can't believe I did that.' It seems so ungrateful.... I was drinking far too much and that was kind of the basis of my relationship with this boy. I couldn't bear to be without him, so I was like, 'Well, I'll just cancel my stuff then.'"[37] She referred to this period as her "early life crisis".[37] She is also known for her dislike of flying and bouts of homesickness when away from her native London.[38] By the middle of October 2008, Adele's attempt to break in America appeared to have failed.[39] But then she was booked as the musical guest on 18 October 2008 episode of NBC's Saturday Night Live. The episode, which included an expected appearance by then US vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, earned the program its best ratings in 14 years with 17 million viewers. Adele performed "Chasing Pavements" and "Cold Shoulder,"[40] and the following day, 19 topped the iTunes charts and ranked at number five at Amazon.com while "Chasing Pavements" rose into the top 25.[41] The album reached number 11 on the Billboard 200 as a result, a jump of 35 places over the previous week.[42] In November 2008, Adele moved to Notting Hill, London after leaving her mother's house, a move that prompted her to give up drinking.[43] The album was certified gold in early 2009, by the RIAA.[44] By July 2009, the album had sold 2.2 million copies worldwide.[45] At the 51st Annual Grammy Awards in February 2009, Adele won the award for Best New Artist, in addition to the award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for "Chasing Pavements", which was also nominated for Record of the Year and Song of the Year.[46] Adele performed "Chasing Pavements" at the ceremony in a duet with Jennifer Nettles. In 2010, Adele received a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for "Hometown Glory."[47] In April her song "My Same" entered the German Singles Chart after it had been performed by Lena Meyer-Landrut in the talent show contest Unser Star für Oslo, or Our Star for Oslo, in which the German entry to the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 was determined.[48][49] In late September, after being featured on The X Factor, Adele's version of Bob Dylan's "Make You Feel My Love" re-entered the UK singles chart at number 4.[50] During the 2010 CMT Artists of the Year special, Adele performed a widely publicised duet of Lady Antebellum's "Nee contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 39 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Adele responseCode 3 200
