The first three town councils in the country were established in Ang Mo Kio in 1986, as part of a pilot project to better serve residents of HDB new towns. The concept eventually became adopted under the Town Council Act of 1988 which today, remains as the second-level of administration in Singapore.[11][12] Ang Mo Kio today, much like its neighbouring towns, is largely urbanized. However, parks are still prevalent in the town as part of the country's green initiative. Parks include Ang Mo Kio Town Garden East and Ang Mo Kio Town Garden West. Although not technically located within Ang Mo Kio itself, the Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park in the adjacent town of Bishan was designed to serve residents of both towns. The park itself straddles along the Ang Mo Kio–Bishan boundary, making it easily accessible from Ang Mo Kio. Etymology[edit] The origin of the name is contested.[13] Old survey maps relate the area as "Amokiah" or the "Mukim (region) of Ang Mo Kio".[14][15] The name was formerly written with the characters 红毛 ang moh, literally "red hair", and one possibility is that the name comes from red-haired tropical fruit rambutan, known as 红毛丹 ang moh dan in Hokkien.[13] However, ang moh can also be used figuratively to mean "Western" or "Caucasian person". Kio in turn could be written either 桥 "bridge", in which case the name would mean "Caucasian's bridge",[16] or 茄 "eggplant", in which case 红毛茄 "Western eggplant" refers to the tomato, which is not native to the region. There are no reports of tomatoes being grown in Ang Mo Kio, so the bridge theory is more likely;[17] nevertheless, there are several commemorative tomato sculptures around Ang Mo Kio.[18] Even assuming kio refers to a bridge, the identity of the bridge remains unclear.[19] One theory states that Ang Mo Kio had two bridges of significance: an old wooden bridge (pang kio in Hokkien) over the Sungei Tongkang river, and a newer concrete bridge on Cheng San Road over a tributary of the Kallang River. Since concrete in Hokkien is 红毛灰 ang mo huay "Western ash", the bridge and consequently the area around it became known as 红毛桥 ang mo kio, short for "concrete bridge".[20] Alternatively, the name could refer to a bridge reputedly constructed under the supervision of British engineer John Turnbull Thomson at what is today the intersection of Upper Thomson Road and Ang Mo Kio Ave 1.[19] The area of Ang Mo Kio has also been historically referred to as Kou Teu Kio, meaning "nine bridges".[21] In the 1970s,[15] the area's Chinese name was changed to 宏茂桥, meaning "Bridge of Expansiveness and Prosperity".[13] Geography[edit] Location[edit] Ang Mo Kio Planning Area, as defined by the Urban Redevelopment Authority, sits within the North-East Region of Singapore, and has a total area of about 1,336 ha (3,300 acres).[22] Yishun bounds Ang Mo Kio to the north, Sengkang to the northeast, Serangoon to the east, Bishan to the south and Central Water Catchment to the west. The main component of the planning area is Ang Mo Kio New Town. The town itself has seven neighbourhoods, with Neighbourhood 1 to the west, cycling in an anti-clockwise direction to Neighbourhood 6 to the north, and ending with Neighbourhood 7 for the town centre. The town centre is located in the heart of Ang Mo Kio and is sandwiched by two town gardens set on natural hillocks. Subzones[edit] Ang Mo Kio Planning Area is officially divided into 12 subzones for urban planning and statistical purposes.[23] Subzone Location Notable structures Accessibility Ang Mo Kio Town Centre Areas around Ang Mo Kio Central 1, Ang Mo Kio Central 2 and Ang Mo Kio Central 3 Ang Mo Kio Public Library, Ang Mo Kio Bus Interchange and AMK Hub Ang Mo Kio MRT station and buses Cheng San Estates along Ang Mo Kio Street 51, Ang Mo Kio Street 52, Ang Mo Kio Street 53 and Ang Mo Kio Street 54 Ang Mo Kio MRT station, Ang Mo Kio Town Garden East and Anderson Secondary School Ang Mo Kio MRT station and buses Chong Boon Southeast Ang Mo Kio Deyi Secondary School and Pathlight School Buses Kebun Baru Precincts west of Ang Mo Kio Town Centre Ang Mo Kio Town Garden West, Kebun Baru Community Club, Kebun Baru Neighbourhood Police Post, CHIJ Saint Nicholas Girls' School, Horizon Green, The Panorama, Horizon Gardens and Mayflower MRT station Mayflower MRT station and buses Sembawang Hills Estates along Seraya Crescent, Casuarina Road, Nemesu Avenue, Old Upper Thomson Road, Sembawang Hills Drive and Thomson Hills Drive Sembawang Hills Food Centre Buses Shangri-La[24] Southwest Ang Mo Kio Mayflower MRT station, Mayflower Secondary School, Ang Mo Kio Primary School, Ang Mo Kio Secondary School and Ang Mo Kio Community Centre Mayflower MRT station, Ang Mo Kio MRT station and buses Tagore[25] Northwest Ang Mo Kio Teacher's Estate, Tagore Industrial Estate, Thomson Nature Park and Lentor MRT station Lentor MRT station, Springleaf MRT station and buses Townsville Areas around Ang Mo Kio Street 31 and Ang Mo Kio Street 32 Ang Mo Kio Swimming Complex, Teck Ghee Neighbourhood Police Post and Townsville Primary School Buses Yio Chu Kang Areas north of Ang Mo Kio Town Centre Yio Chu Kang MRT station, Yio Chu Kang Bus Interchange, Yio Chu Kang Stadium, Yio Chu Kang Swimming Complex, Ang Mo Kio Police Division Headquarters, Ang Mo Kio North Neighbourhood Police Post, Ang Mo Kio Fire Station, Ang Mo Kio Bus Depot (SBS Transit) and Anderson Junior College Yio Chu Kang MRT station and buses Yio Chu Kang East Northeast Ang Mo Kio Nanyang Polytechnic, ITE College Central and Amoy Quee Camp Yio Chu Kang MRT station and buses Yio Chu Kang North Areas bounded by Seletar Expressway, Central Expressway, Yio Chu Kang Road and Lentor Avenue Sungei Seletar Simpang Kiri Buses Yio Chu Kang West Areas bounded by Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6 and Yio Chu Kang Road Anderson Primary School, Presbyterian High School, Yio Chu Kang Secondary School and Lentor MRT station Yio Chu Kang MRT station, Lentor MRT station and buses History[edit] Background and early history[edit] The present-day Ang Mo Kio area remained largely uninhabited throughout the 19th century. Settlers were attracted to the area only around the start of the 20th century, as a result of the rubber boom. In the old maps of Singapore, much of the area was labelled as the Ang Mo Kio Forest Reserve with many plantation estates. In 1934, The Straits Times stated that the mukim of Ang Mo Kio referred to the area between Thomson Road and Yio Chu Kang Road, and consisted of rubber plantations.[26] In August 1938, a then-unnamed village along Thomson Road was named Ang Mo Kio Village by the Singapore Rural Board.[27] Development of Ang Mo Kio New Town[edit] Aerial view of Ang Mo Kio Town Centre. Initially, Ang Mo Kio was designated as an industrial area housing motor workshops which had to be relocated due to the Urban Renewal Programme, but the plans were then modified to include areas for homes and communal amenities.[28] Plans for the new town were announced by the then-Minister for Law and National Development Mr E.W. Barker in August 1973. The new town was planned to have a total of 45,000 flats, and be demarcated by Upper Thomson and Yio Chu Kang Roads, located adjacent to the Serangoon Gardens estate.[29] To make way for the new town, 200 acres (81 ha) of land at Teck Ghee village was cleared, with the residents affected rehoused at the Sin Ming road estate.[30] contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 44 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Ang_Mo_Kio responseCode 3 200
