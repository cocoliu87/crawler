Gang rape in literature[edit] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (July 2020) Hebrew Bible[edit] The Hebrew Bible documents two narratives of gang rapes: the infamous account of Sodom and the story of the Levite Concubine in Gibeah (presented as a doublet with mimicking literary structure to the former). Both instances result in the judgement of God through destruction and war respectively. Perpetrator characteristics[edit] Gang rapes are typically perpetrated by two or more men, and tend to have somewhat different characteristics than rapes by individuals. For instance, gang rapists tend to be younger[15] and are more often repeat offenders, and the gang is more likely to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Gang rapes are more violent on average compared to its individual counterpart, with significantly more severe sexual and non-sexual injuries to the victim. The gang members also typically dehumanize the victim more before and during the rape.[3][4][5] Gang rapes are almost always premeditated in their intent, target victim(s), social proof, and psychological causes.[16][17][clarification needed] Social factors such as civil wars, hate propaganda, and ethnic conflicts increase the rate of gang rape.[18][19] Rape gang members often have a binding force such as the same race, or place of residence thereby forming a close-knit peer pressure group, encouraged by the behavior of their fellow criminals.[3][4][5] Gang rape can result from a group form of criminal spin, in which the group starts with less serious offenses which ultimately lead them to go well beyond their initial intention. In a 2013 study based on 25-year crime data from US and Europe, between 10% and 20% of all rapes were gang rapes. Less than one in three gang rapes are reported, while less than 1 in 20 attempted but failed gang rapes are reported.[1] Motives[edit] Sexual entitlement and entertainment[edit] A 2013 Lancet report found that among the motives for rape were sexual entitlement and seeking of entertainment. Associated factors in the crime included alcohol misuse, poverty, personal history of childhood victimization, need to prove heterosexual performance, dominance over women, and participation in gangs and related activities. As of September 2013[update], according to the report, most cases were not reported to law enforcement, and just 23% of single or multiple perpetrator rapes that were reported by the victims ended in prison sentence.[6] The 1886 Mount Rennie rape case in Sydney, Australia falls in this category. As an act of war[edit] Main article: War rape Gang rapes during civil wars and ethnic riots take added dimension of becoming a means of revenge, sending a message to the victims' community, inducing fear in the opponent, and creating a sense of solidarity among the soldiers or militants or the violent group.[7][20] At least 20,000 women were raped or gang raped and afterwards killed during the Nanjing Massacre, also known as the Rape of Nanking, during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945). Major ethnic conflicts and wars within the last 50 years have witnessed a campaign of gang rapes.[21] Rapes by Soviet soldiers and the Mahmudiyah rape and killings by American soldiers are examples of such war crimes. The Congo war saw thousands of gang rapes every week, with each relief center reporting 10 or more daily victims of gang rape with battering of women.[8][22] The Rwandan genocide of 1994 witnessed numerous gang rapes by soldiers.[23] The Bosnian war during the 1990s saw a similar campaign of gang rapes.[9] In the 1990s, the Kashmir region which was a battlefield between Jihadists and the Indian armed forces also saw a number of gang rapes which were perpetrated by both sides of the conflict to instill fear in the population of each side.[24] In the 2000s, civil war-torn countries such as Sudan, Afghanistan and Syria reported high rates of gang rapes by government soldiers, security forces, insurgents, and militias.[10][25][26][27] Similar incidents have been recorded in Libya,[28] and Mali.[29] As punishment[edit] See also: Corrective rape A 2013 Lancet report on rape and gang rape in Bangladesh, China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Sri Lanka found that the crime was committed for various motives, including as a means to inflict punishment on the victim.[6] Traditionally, the Cheyenne people of North America used gang rape as punishment for female transgressions.[11] A similar practice existed among the Munduruku people of South America.[12] Among the Mpumalanga of South Africa, there are instances of gang rape as punishment.[13] In Argentina and Pakistan,[30] gang rape has been reported to have been ordered as punishment. Religious or racial factors[edit] Though having the same race or religion often acts as a binding force for creating a close-knit serial rape gangs,[3][4][5] studies reported that 30% of these shared-identity rape gangs specifically targeted people of another religion or race.[14] Gang rape by country[edit] This is an incomplete list of countries, where government or media have acknowledged the problem of gang rape. A study found that the gang rapes involved more alcohol and drug use, night attacks and severe sexual assault outcomes and less victim resistance and fewer weapons than individual rapes.[31] Another study found that group sexual assaults were more violent and had greater resistance from the victim than individual sexual assaults and that victims of group sexual assaults were more likely to seek crisis and police services, to contemplate suicide and seek psychotherapy than those involved in individual assaults. The two groups were about the same in the amount of drug use and drinking during the assault.[32] Porter and Alison have analyzed 739 gang rape cases from US and UK, and found over 20% of the gang rape victims died from injuries from the gang rape.[33] Gang rape is sometimes stereotyped in media as a crime of poor, minorities, or culture; however, gang rape incidence rates are high in wealthy college campuses, among non-minorities and every culture.[34] Bangladesh[edit] A 2013 Lancet study reports 1.9% of all rural men in Bangladesh have committed multiple perpetrator rape (gang rape) of a woman who was not a partner, compared to 1.4% urban men. 35% of those who have committed gang rapes against women have also committed additional rapes where the victim was a man. The motives of rape included a combination of reasons. Two thirds of the gang rape perpetrators claimed entertainment as their motive, 30% claimed they participated in gang rape out of anger and to inflict punishment on the victim, while 11% indicated the crime followed alcohol consumption.[6] Brazil[edit] This section's factual accuracy may be compromised due to out-of-date information.

(March 2015) In the state of Rio de Janeiro alone, over 6,000 rapes are reported every year (or about 37 per 100,000 people).[35] Nationwide, the rape rate varied between 26 and 32 per 100,000 women in 2009.[36] The arrest rates on rape complaints, was 4% in Rio.[35] About 19.6% of 2011 rapes were gang rapes.[37] In 2016, more than 30 men drugged and gang raped a 16-year-old girl and later posted photos and a video to boast about it online.[38][39] Canada[edit] Peer pressure and sexual aggression are among the cited reasons for the crime.[40][41] Since 1983, Canada does not track rape or gang rape statistics separately, but tracks and reports Sexual Assault Tier 3 which includes both rape and gang rape. The average Sexual Assault Tier 3 victim rate in Canada was 15 per 100,000 women, according to a 2013 Statistics Canada article about violence against women.[42] China[edit] See also: Yan Xiaoling – Fan Yanqiong case A Lancet study reports, in an on contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 43 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Gang_rape responseCode 3 200
