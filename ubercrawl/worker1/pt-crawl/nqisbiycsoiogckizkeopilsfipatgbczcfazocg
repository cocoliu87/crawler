The tower is located on a city block bounded by Greenwich, Vesey, Washington, and Barclay Streets on the east, south, west, and north, respectively. It was developed by Larry Silverstein, who holds a ground lease for the site from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. The building was constructed to replace the original structure on the site, part of the original World Trade Center. The previous structure, completed in 1987, was destroyed in the September 11 attacks in 2001. Construction of the new 7 World Trade Center began in 2002 and was completed in May 2006. The building is 52 stories tall (plus one underground floor), making it the 28th-tallest in New York.[2][3][4] It is built on a smaller footprint than the original; a small park across Greenwich Street occupies space that was part of the original building's footprint. The current building's design emphasizes safety, with a reinforced concrete core, wider stairways, and thicker fireproofing on steel columns. It also incorporates numerous green design features. The building was the first commercial office building in New York City to receive the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification, where it won a gold rating. It was also one of the first projects accepted to be part of the council's pilot program for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design – Core and Shell Development (LEED-CS).[5] History[edit] The original 7 World Trade Center was a 47-story building with a red granite facade.[6][7] Opened in 1987, it was the seventh structure of the World Trade Center.[8] The World Trade Center's twin towers were destroyed during the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, creating debris that destroyed or severely damaged nearby buildings, such as the original 7 World Trade Center.[9] Preliminary site plans for the World Trade Center rebuild The new 7 World Trade Center from the ground World Trade Center Towers One 3 4 7 Planned: 2 5 Other elements Liberty Park National September 11 Memorial & Museum PATH Station Performing Arts Center Oculus St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church Vehicular Security Center Artwork America's Response Monument ONE: Union of the Senses The Sphere History One WTC construction Original complex 7 WTC WTC site v t e Construction[edit] 7 World Trade Center construction in October 2004 The construction phase of the new 7 World Trade Center began on May 7, 2002, with the installation of a fence around the construction site.[1] Tishman Construction Corporation of New York began work at the new 7 World Trade Center in 2002, soon after the site was cleared of debris. Restoring the Con Ed substation was an urgent priority to meet power demands of Lower Manhattan.[10] Because 7 World Trade Center is separate from the main 16-acre (6.5 ha) World Trade Center site, Larry Silverstein required approval from only the Port Authority, and rebuilding was able to proceed quickly.[11] Once construction of the power substation was completed in October 2003, work proceeded on building the office tower. An unusual approach was used in constructing the building; erecting the steel frame before adding the concrete core. This approach allowed the construction schedule to be shortened by a few months.[12] Construction was completed in 2006 at a cost of $700 million.[13] Though Silverstein received $861 million from insurance on the old building, he owed more than $400 million on its mortgage.[14] Costs to rebuild were covered by $475 million in Liberty Bonds, which provide tax-exempt financing to help stimulate rebuilding in Lower Manhattan and insurance money that remained after other expenses.[15] A 15,000 sq ft (1,400 m2) triangular park was created between the extended Greenwich Street and West Broadway by David Childs with Ken Smith and his colleague, Annie Weinmayr, of Ken Smith Landscape Architect. The park comprises an open central plaza with a fountain and flanking groves of sweetgum trees and boxwood shrubs.[16] At the center of the fountain, sculptor Jeff Koons created Balloon Flower (Red), whose mirror-polished stainless steel represents a twisted balloon in the shape of a flower.[17] Completion and early years[edit] 2000s[edit] The building was officially opened at noon on May 23, 2006, with a free concert featuring Suzanne Vega, Citizen Cope, Bill Ware Vibes, Brazilian Girls, Ollabelle, Pharaoh's Daughter, Ronan Tynan (of the Irish Tenors), and special guest Lou Reed.[18][19] Prior to opening, in March 2006, the new building's lobby and facade as a filming location for the movie Perfect Stranger.[20] After the building opened, several unleased upper floors were used for events such as charity lunches, fashion shows, and black-tie galas. Silverstein Properties allowed space in the new building to be used for these events as a means to draw people to see the building.[21] From September 8 to October 7, 2006, the work of photographer Jonathan Hyman was displayed in "An American Landscape", a free exhibit hosted by the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation at 7 World Trade Center. The photographs captured the response of people in New York City and across the United States after the September 11, 2001, attacks. The exhibit took place on the 45th floor while space remained available for lease.[22] New York Academy of Sciences office (lobby) on the 40th floor By March 2007, 60 percent of the building had been leased.[23] In September 2006, Moody's signed a 20-year lease to rent 15 floors of 7 World Trade Center.[24] Other tenants that had signed leases in 7 World Trade Center, as of May 2007, included ABN AMRO,[25] Ameriprise Financial Inc.,[26][19] law firm Wilmer Hale,[27] publisher Mansueto Ventures,[28] and the New York Academy of Sciences.[29][19] Silverstein Properties also has offices and the Silver Suites executive office suites[30] in 7 World Trade Center, along with office space used by the architectural and engineering firms working on 1 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 175 Greenwich Street, and 200 Greenwich Street.[31] After AMN AMRO was acquired by the Royal Bank of Scotland, forex services provider FXDD subleased some of the Royal Bank of Scotland's space in 2009.[32] The space occupied by Mansueto Ventures has been designed to use the maximum amount of natural light and has an open floor plan.[33] The space used by the New York Academy of Sciences on the 40th floor, designed by H3 Hardy Collaboration Architecture, works with the parallelogram shape of the building. Keeping with the green design of the building, the NYAS uses recycled materials in many of the office furnishings, has zoned heating and cooling, and motion-detecting lights, which activate automatically when people are present, and adjust according to incoming sunlight.[34] 2010s to present[edit] The building became fully leased in September 2011 after MSCI agreed to occupy 125,000 square feet (11,600 m2) on the top floor.[35][36] Following this, Silverstein announced in 2012 that he would refinance the building with a $452.8 million Liberty bond issue and a $125 million commercial mortgage-backed security loan.[37][38] At the time, the building was valued at $940 million, in large part because it was fully occupied.[38] FXDD subleased its space to engineering company Permasteelisa in 2015[39] and artificial intelligence firm IPsoft in 2016.[40] The building was 94.8 percent occupied by 2017. At the time, roughly three-quarters of the space was occupied by four tenants, including Moody's, the Royal Bank of Scotland, and Wilmer Hale.[41] Wedding planning company Zola[42] and the building's own architecture firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill both leased space at 7 WTC in early 2019.[43] This was followed in July 2019 by luxury drink brand Moët Hennessy[44][45] and media company AccuWeather.[45] After publisher Mansueto Ventures and three other firms took space at 7 WTC in April 2022, the building was 97 percent occupied.[46][47] Shortly afterward, Silverstein Properties refinanced the property with a $458 million loan from Goldman Sachs.[47][48][49] Architecture[edit] The new 7 World Trade Center has 52 stories and is 741 ft (226 m) tall.[50] The building has 42 floors of leasable space, starting at the 11th floor, and a total of 1.7 million sq ft (160,000 m2) of office space.[51] The first ten floors house an electrical substation which provides power to much of Lower Manhattan. The office tower has a narrower footprint at ground level than did its predecessor, so the course of Greenwich Street could be restored to reunite TriBeCa and the Financial District. The original building, on the other hand, had bordered West Broadway on the east, necessitating the destruction of Greenwich Street between Barclay Street and the northern border of the World Trade Center superblock.[10] Facade[edit] David  contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 54 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/7_World_Trade_Center responseCode 3 200
