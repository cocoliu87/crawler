The ICC Men's ODI Team Rankings (formerly known as the ICC ODI Championship) is an international One Day International (ODI) cricket rankings system of the International Cricket Council (ICC). After every ODI match, the two teams involved receive points based on a mathematical formula. Each team's points total is divided by their total number of matches played to give a rating, and all the teams are ranked in a table in order of rating.[1] By analogy to cricket batting averages, the points for winning an ODI match are always greater than the team's rating, increasing the rating, and the points for losing an ODI match are always less than the rating, reducing the rating. A drawn match between higher and lower rated teams will benefit the lower-rated team at the expense of the higher-rated team. An "average" team that wins as often as it loses while playing a mix of stronger and weaker teams should have a rating of 100.[1] As of 14 October 2023[update], India leads the ICC Men's ODI Team Rankings, with a rating of 118 from 47 weighted matches, while the lowest rated team, UAE, has a rating of 15 from 41 weighted matches.[2] Until 2013, the team ranked number one at the annual 1 April cut-off date received the ICC ODI Championship Shield and prize money.[3] Up until the 2019 edition, the rankings were used to award direct qualification for the Cricket World Cup.[4] Current rankings[edit] right=float:right;clear:right;margin-left:1em; left=float:left;clear:left;margin-right:1em; centre=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto; #default= ICC Men's ODI Team Rankings v t e Rank Team Matches Points Rating 1 India 52 6,290 121 2 Australia 38 4,318 114 3 South Africa 32 3,550 111 4 Pakistan 32 3,525 111 5 New Zealand 41 4,189 102 6 England 36 3,509 97 7 Sri Lanka 46 4,082 89 8 Bangladesh 43 3,772 88 9 Afghanistan 28 2,408 86 10 West Indies 38 2,582 68 11 Zimbabwe 30 1,641 55 12 Scotland 33 1,662 50 13 Ireland 25 1,083 43 14 Netherlands 35 1,445 41 15 Nepal 42 1,446 34 16 Namibia 28 813 29 17 United States 31 808 26 18 Oman 24 525 22 19 United Arab Emirates 41 617 15 Reference: ICC ODI rankings, Last updated 6 November 2023 Matches is the number of matches played in the 12–24 months since the May before last, plus half the number in the 24 months before that.

Associate rankings[edit] Main article: World Cricket League § Associate one-day rankings Nepal Captain Paras Khadka batting during the 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three in Bermuda In late 2005, the International Cricket Council ranked the top non-Test nations from 11–30 to complement the Test nations' rankings in the ICC Men's ODI Team Rankings. The ICC used the results from the 2005 ICC Trophy and WCQS Division 2 competition (i.e. the primary qualification mechanisms for the 2007 Cricket World Cup) to rank the nations. These rankings were used to seed the initial stage of the global World Cricket League. Teams ranked 11–16 were placed into Division 1; teams 17–20 were placed into Division 2; teams 21–24 were placed into Division 3; the remaining teams were placed into the upper divisions of their respective regional qualifiers. As of 19 April 2009 the top six associates gained one day status. Kenya and Ireland have both qualified to appear on the main rating table, Kenya from its existing status and Ireland for its two victories in the 2007 World Cup. Following their victory over Bangladesh in July 2010, the Netherlands joined the main table. Afghanistan, Canada and Scotland remain on the secondary table. In May 2009, the ICC added a rankings table for all associate members. This contained both global and regional placings. In June 2018, the four associates with ODI status were moved to the main ranking list.[5] Historical rankings[edit] The ICC provides ratings for the end of each month back to October 2002. This table lists the teams that have successively held the highest rating since that date, by whole month periods.

The table only begins from 1981 as, prior to this date, there is not enough data available due to the infrequency of matches and the small number of competing teams in the earlier periods. The teams that have successively held the highest rating since January 1981 until September 2002, by whole month periods, are: Team Start End Total months Cumulative months England January 1981 February 1981 2 2 West Indies June 1981 November 1981 6 6 England December 1981 December 1981 1 3 West Indies January 1982 May 1987 65 71 England August 1987 March 1988 8 11 West Indies April 1988 May 1988 2 73 England August 1988 May 1989 10 21 West Indies August 1989 December 1989 5 78 Australia January 1990 March 1990 3 3 West Indies April 1990 April 1990 1 79 Australia May 1990 May 1990 1 4 West Indies July 1990 July 1990 1 80 Australia August 1990 November 1990 4 8 Pakistan December 1990 January 1991 2 2 Australia February 1991 May 1991 4 12 Pakistan August 1991 August 1991 1 3 Australia October 1991 May 1992 8 20 England August 1992 March 1993 8 29 West Indies April 1993 April 1993 1 81 Australia May 1993 July 1993 3 23 West Indies August 1993 November 1994 16 97 India December 1994 March 1995 4 4 West Indies April 1995 May 1995 2 99 India August 1995 October 1995 3 7 England November 1995 December 1995 2 31 Australia January 1996 April 1996 4 27 South Africa May 1996 February 2000 46 46 Australia March 2000 January 2002 23 50 South Africa February 2002 February 2002 1 47 Australia March 2002 September 2002 7 57 Reference: Historical Rankings The summary of teams that have held the highest rating since 1981 until present by whole month periods, are: Team Total months Highest rating Australia 204 140 West Indies 99 141 South Africa 71 134 England 66 135 India 25 127 New Zealand 18 121 Pakistan 4 131 Reference: Historical Rankings updated to 21 January 2023 ICC ODI championship (2002–2013)[edit] ICC ODI Championship Shield The rankings system was formerly called the ICC ODI championship and, until 2013, the team at the top of the table at the start of each April was awarded the ICC ODI Championship Shield. Like a 2 euro coin, the shield features an inner circle of gold-coloured metal and is surrounded by a ring of silver-coloured metal. It was first presented in December 2002, when Australian captain Ricky Ponting received the award.[9] It was last presented in July 2013, when Indian captain MS Dhoni received the award.[10] Year Nation 2002 Australia 2003 Australia 2004 Australia 2005 Australia 2006 Australia 2007 Australia 2008 South Africa 2009 South Africa 2010 Australia 2011 Australia 2012 Australia 2013 India Points calculations[edit] Time period[edit] Each team scores points based on the results of their matches over the last 3−4 years − the matches played in the 12–24 months since the May before last, plus the matches played in the 24 months before that, for which the matches played and points earned both count half. For example: May 2010 May 2011 May 2012 May 2013 May 2014 May 2015 Between May 2013 and April 2014: Results that were achieved during this period have 50% weighting Results that were achieved during this period have 100% weighting Between May 2014 and April 2015: Results that were achieved during this period have 50% weighting Results that were achieved during this period have 100% weighting Each May, the matches and points earned between 3 and 4 years ago are removed, and the matches and points earned between 1 and 2 years ago switch fro contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 63 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/ICC_Men%27s_ODI_Team_Rankings responseCode 3 200
