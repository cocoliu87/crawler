It is used at a dosage of 60 mg/day for this indication.[10] In the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene (MORE) clinical trial, raloxifene decreased the risk of all types of breast cancer by 62%, of invasive breast cancer by 72%, and of invasive estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer by 84%.[12] Conversely, it does not reduce the risk of estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer.[12] There were no obvious differences in effectiveness of raloxifene in the MORE trial for prevention of breast cancer at a dosage of 60 mg/m2/day relative to 120 mg/m2/day.[12] In the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR) trial, 60 mg/day raloxifene was 78% as effective as 20 mg/day tamoxifen in preventing non-invasive breast cancer.[13] Women with undetectable levels of estradiol (<2.7 pg/mL) have a naturally low risk of breast cancer and, in contrast to women with detectable levels of estradiol, do not experience significant benefit from raloxifene in terms of reduction of breast cancer risk.[12] Contraindications[edit] Raloxifene is contraindicated in lactating women or women who are or who may become pregnant.[14] It also may be of concern to women with active or past history of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and retinal vein thrombosis.[15] Side effects[edit] Common side effects of raloxifene include hot flashes (25–28% vs. 18–21% for placebo),[12] vaginal dryness, and leg cramps (generally mild; 5.5% vs. 1.9% for placebo).[14][1][16] Raloxifene does not cause breast tenderness, endometrial hyperplasia, menstrual bleeding, or endometrial cancer.[17] It does not appear to affect cognition or memory.[15][12] Raloxifene is a teratogen; i.e., it can cause developmental abnormalities such as birth defects. Raloxifene may infrequently cause serious blood clots to form in the legs, lungs, or eyes.[1] Other reactions experienced include leg swelling/pain, trouble breathing, chest pain, and vision changes. Black box warnings were added to the label of raloxifene in 2007 warning of increased risk of death due to stroke for postmenopausal women with documented coronary heart disease or at increased risk for major coronary events, as well as increased risk for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.[14] The risk of venous thromboembolism with raloxifene is increased by several-fold in postmenopausal women (RR Tooltip relative risk = 3.1).[18][12] Raloxifene has a lower risk of thromboembolism than tamoxifen.[13] In the MORE trial, raloxifene caused a 40% decrease in risk of cardiovascular events in women who were at increased risk for coronary artery disease, although there was no decrease in cardiovascular events for the group as a whole.[12] A report in September 2009 from Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality suggests that tamoxifen and raloxifene used to treat breast cancer, significantly reduce invasive breast cancer in midlife and older women, but also increase the risk of adverse side effects.[19] A recent human case report in July 2016 suggests that raloxifene may in fact, at some point, also stimulate breast cancer growth leading to a reduction of advanced breast cancer disease upon the withdrawal of the drug.[20] Unlike other SERMs, such as tamoxifen, raloxifene has no risk of uterine hyperplasia or endometrial cancer (RR Tooltip relative risk = 0.8).[1][18][13] Raloxifene does not increase the incidence of breast pain or tenderness in postmenopausal women.[16][21] Overdose[edit] Raloxifene has been studied in clinical trials across a dosage range of 30 to 600 mg/day, and was well-tolerated at all dosages.[16] Pharmacology[edit] Pharmacodynamics[edit] Mechanism of action[edit] Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and hence is a mixed agonist and antagonist of the estrogen receptor (ER) in different tissues.[4] It has estrogenic activity in some tissues, such as bone and the liver, and antiestrogenic activity in other tissues, such as the breasts and uterus.[4] Its affinity (Kd) for the ERα is approximately 50 pM, which is similar to that of estradiol.[16] Relative to estradiol, raloxifene has been reported to possess about 8 to 34% of the affinity for the ERα and 0.5 to 76% of the affinity for the ERβ.[22][23] Raloxifene acts as a partial agonist of the ERα and as a pure antagonist of the ERβ.[24][25] In contrast to the classical ERs, raloxifene is an agonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) (EC50 Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration = 10–100 nM), a membrane estrogen receptor.[26][27] Clinical effects[edit] Raloxifene has antiestrogenic effects in the mammary glands in preclinical studies.[16] In accordance, raloxifene reduces breast density in postmenopausal women, a known risk factor for breast cancer.[28] It does not stimulate the uterus in postmenopausal women, and results in no increase in risk of endometrial thickening, vaginal bleeding, endometrial hyperplasia, or endometrial cancer.[29][16][21] At the same time, raloxifene has minimal antiestrogenic effect in the uterus in premenopausal women.[29] This may possibly be due to inadequate tissue exposure of the uterus to raloxifene in these estrogen-rich individuals.[29] In premenopausal women, raloxifene increases levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol.[12] Conversely, in postmenopausal women, raloxifene has been found to reduce levels of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH, while not affecting levels of estradiol.[12][29] Raloxifene also decreases prolactin levels in postmenopausal women.[29] In men, raloxifene has been found to disinhibit the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis) and thereby increase total testosterone levels.[30][31][32][33] Due to the simultaneous increase in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels however, free testosterone levels often remain unchanged in men during therapy with raloxifene.[30] Raloxifene has estrogenic effects on liver protein synthesis.[12] It increases SHBG levels in both pre- and postmenopausal women as well as in men.[12][30] The medication decreases levels of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, C-reactive protein, apolipoprotein B, and homocysteine.[12][29] Conversely, it has little effect on levels of triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein (HDL).[12] Raloxifene has been shown to inhibit the oxidation of LDL cholesterol in vitro.[16] The medication has been found to decrease insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels in pre- and postmenopausal women as well as in men.[31] It has also been found to increase insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) levels in pre- and postmenopausal women.[12] Due to activation of estrogen receptors in the liver, raloxifene has procoagulatory effects, such as decreasing levels of fibrinogen and influencing levels of other coagulation factors.[12][29][16] For these reasons, raloxifene increases the ris contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 44 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Raloxifene responseCode 3 200
