The tournament was hosted by India. It started on 5 October and concluded on 19 November 2023, with Australia winning the tournament.[1] Ten national teams participated. All had to qualify for the tournament through the 2023 Cricket World Cup qualification process. India qualified as hosts; Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, England, New Zealand, Pakistan and South Africa qualified via the ICC Cricket World Cup Super League, with the Netherlands and Sri Lanka securing the final two places via the qualifier tournament in Zimbabwe during June and July 2023. The West Indies missed out on qualification for the first time in their history. All teams were asked to finalise their 15-player squads prior to 28 September, with any replacements after this date requiring approval from the ICC. A selection panel chose 16 officials to umpire and referee at the matches. It was the first men's Cricket World Cup which India hosted solely. The tournament took place in ten different stadiums, in ten cities across the country. In the first semi-final India beat New Zealand, and in the second semi-final Australia beat South Africa. The final took place between India and Australia at Narendra Modi Stadium on 19 November with Australia winning the title for the sixth time.[2] The top eight placed teams in the tournament's final points table qualified for the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy, the next ICC ODI tournament. Virat Kohli was the player of the tournament and also scored the most runs; Mohammed Shami was the leading wicket-taker. Background Originally, the competition was to be played from 9 February to 26 March 2023.[3][4] In July 2020 it was announced that that the tournament would be moved to October and November as a result of the qualification schedule being disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[5][6] The ICC released the tournament schedule on 27 June 2023.[7][8] The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) had threatened to boycott the competition after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) refused to send a team to the 2023 Asia Cup scheduled in Pakistan.[9][10] This issue was resolved in June 2023 after the Asian Cricket Council announced that the competition would be hosted using a hybrid model proposed by the PCB, with nine of the 13 matches in the competition played in Sri Lanka.[11][12] This was the first ICC World Cup in which penalties for slow over-rates were given to bowling sides if they did not complete their 50 overs in the stipulated time. On-field umpires could penalise the bowling team by not allowing more than four fielders outside the 30-yard circle.[13] Qualification Highlighted are the countries that participated in the 2023 Cricket World Cup. Qualified as host Qualified via the 2020–2023 Super League Qualified via the 2023 Qualifier Participated in the qualifier but failed to qualify Main article: 2023 Cricket World Cup qualification Like the previous World Cup, the tournament featured ten teams. The main route for qualification was, however, through the new ICC Cricket World Cup Super League, a series of matches played between 2020 and 2023 rather than the ODI rankings.[14] The top eight of the 13 sides in the Super League qualified for the World Cup automatically, although as hosts India, who finished fourth, were guaranteed a place. In June and July 2023, the bottom five teams from the Super League and the top five ranked associate sides competed in the 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier for the remaining two places.[15][16] As a result of the qualifying process, the competition was the first not to include former winners West Indies, who failed to progress for the first time in their history, after their defeat to Scotland.[17] Full members Ireland and Zimbabwe also missed out on qualification, meaning three of the four full members who took part in the knock-out qualification stage did not qualify, with only Sri Lanka progressing.[18] The final qualification spot fell to an eliminator between associate members, Scotland and Netherlands.[19] The Netherlands won the eliminator and took the final spot in the finals stage of the competition.[17] Means of qualification Date Venue Berths Qualified Host nation — — 1 India ICC Super League 30 July 2020 – 14 May 2023 Various 7 Afghanistan Australia Bangladesh England New Zealand Pakistan South Africa Qualifier 18 June 2023 – 9 July 2023 Zimbabwe 2 Sri Lanka Netherlands Total 10 Marketing The International Cricket Council announced the winner's trophy would tour the world 100 days before the commencement of the event. Photographs of the trophy were taken at each location.[20] Ahead of the tournament, it was reported that an opening ceremony would take place on 4 October 2023 at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, a day before the opening match at the same venue.[21] The organisers cancelled the opening ceremony, and replaced it with a press conference featuring the ten team captains.[22] The ICC officially announced the mascots for the World Cup on August 19; following the announcement, there was an event held in Gurgaon with two U-19 World Cup-winning captains, Shafali Verma and Yash Dhull. The mascots are a male and female duo named "Tonk" and "Blaze" respectively from the fictional cricketing utopia called "Crictoverse". They embody the principle of gender equality.[23][24] The official theme song of the 2023 Cricket World Cup titled "Dil Jashn Bole" (transl. Heart say celebrate) was released on 20 September. The song was composed by Pritam while lyrics were written by Shloke Lal and Saaveri Verma. The song was sung by Pritam, Nakash Aziz, Sreerama Chandra, Amit Mishra, Jonita Gandhi, Akasa Singh and S. P. Charan. The accompanying music video featured actor Ranveer Singh, many Indian Instagram reel makers and YouTubers.[25] However, the song was subject to backlash and bad reviews.[26] Venues Mumbai Kolkata Bangalore Pune New Delhi Hyderabad Chennai Ahmedabad Dharamshala Lucknow class=notpageimage| 2023 Cricket World Cup venues The tournament took place in ten different stadiums, situated in ten different cities across India. The first and second semi-finals were held at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai and Eden Gardens in Kolkata respectively, while the final took place at Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.[7] The BCCI provided funding for renovations and refurbishments at stadiums. Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium received a new grass surface, drainage system, seating, and hospitality boxes. Wankhede Stadium had upgrades to the outfield, floodlights, corporate boxes, and toilets. M. A. Chidambaram Stadium installed new floodlights and relaid two wickets.[27] With the autumn scheduling of this World Cup, the ICC instituted protocols for reducing the impact of moisture—including dew and rain—on pitch conditions, so that they did not give the team batting second an advantage (as had frequently occurred in the 2021 Men's T20 World Cup). These included using a specific wetting agent, and the boundary set at around 70 m (77 yards) at each stadium, with more grass on the pitch to encourage seam bowling over spin bowling.[28] Location Stadium Capacity[29] No. of matches Ahmedabad Narendra Modi Stadium 132,000 5 Bangalore M.

It also selected four match referees for the event.[33][34] Warm-up matches Warm-up matches were held from 29 September to 3 October 2023 at Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium in Hyderabad, Assam Cricket Association Stadium in Guwahati, and Greenfield International Stadium in Thiruvananthapuram.[7] India's warm-up fixtures were announced on 27 June.
