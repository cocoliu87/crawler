Pantheism is the philosophical religious belief that reality,[1] the universe and the cosmos are identical to divinity and a supreme being or entity. The physical universe is thus understood as an immanent deity, still expanding and creating, which has existed since the beginning of time.[2] The term 'pantheist' designates one who holds both that everything constitutes a unity and that this unity is divine, consisting of an all-encompassing, manifested god or goddess.[3][4] All astronomical objects are thence viewed as parts of a sole deity. The worship of all gods of every religion is another definition, but it is more precisely termed Omnism.[5] Pantheist belief does not recognize a distinct personal god,[6] anthropomorphic or otherwise, but instead characterizes a broad range of doctrines differing in forms of relationships between reality and divinity.[7] Pantheistic concepts date back thousands of years, and pantheistic elements have been identified in various religious traditions. The term pantheism was coined by mathematician Joseph Raphson in 1697[8][9] and since then, it has been used to describe the beliefs of a variety of people and organizations. Pantheism was popularized in Western culture as a theology and philosophy based on the work of the 17th-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza, in particular, his book Ethics.[10] A pantheistic stance was also taken in the 16th century by philosopher and cosmologist Giordano Bruno.[11] Etymology[edit] Pantheism derives from the Greek word πᾶν pan (meaning "all, of everything") and θεός theos (meaning "god, divine"). The first known combination of these roots appears in Latin, in Joseph Raphson's 1697 book De Spatio Reali seu Ente Infinito,[9] where he refers to the "pantheismus" of Spinoza and others.[8] It was subsequently translated into English as "pantheism" in 1702. Definitions[edit] Pantheists believe that the universe itself and everything in it forms a single, all-encompassing deity.[12][13] Part of a series on Spirituality Outline Religion History Timeline Traditional Elite religion Jewish Merkabah Kabbalah Hasidism Christian Catholic Mysticism Sufism Folk religion Modern Buddhist modernism New religious movement Secular spirituality "Spiritual but not religious" Syncretism Spiritual experience Lived religion Mystical experience Oceanic feeling Religious experience Religious ecstasy Spiritual practice Spiritual development Ego death Individuation Self-actualization Spiritual activism Spiritual development Influences Western General Divine illumination Pantheism Panentheism Antiquity Gnosticism Hermeticism Neoplatonism Western esotericism Medieval Mysticism Early modern Perennial philosophy Jakob Böhme Emanuel Swedenborg Pietism Modern Romanticism Transcendentalism Universalism New Thought Theosophy Anthroposophy Occultism Spiritualism Esoteric Christianity New Age Orientalist Comparative religion Neo-Advaita Nonduality Orientalism Theosophical Society Asian Pre-historic Proto-Indo-Iranian religion Iran Zoroastrianism India Advaita Vedanta Buddha-nature Enlightenment Madhyamaka Neo-Vedanta Tantra Yoga Yogachara East-Asia Taoism Other non-Western Animism Shamanism Totemism Psychological Humanistic psychology Mindfulness Positive psychology Self-help Self-realization True self and false self Research Neurological Mystical psychosis Cognitive science of religion Neuroscience of religion Geschwind syndrome Evolutionary psychology of religion Category v t e Part of a series on Irreligion Irreligion Antireligion Anti-clericalism Nontheistic religions Pantheism Theological noncognitivism Transtheism Criticism of religion Freethought Parody religion Secular humanism Atheism History Demographics Discrimination/Persecution Criticism Lists of atheists Forms and variations Implicit and explicit Negative and positive New State Christian Hindu Jewish Aspects Antitheism Relationship between atheism and religion Existence of God Agnosticism Strong Weak Agnostic atheism Agnostic theism Christian Apatheism Secular Buddhism List of agnostics Deism Christian deism Ietsism Pandeism Natural theology Spinozism Theophilanthropy Deus otiosus Deistic evolution List of deists People Atheists Agnostics Humanists Pantheists Deists Books Breaking the Spell The Demon-Haunted World The End of Faith The Evolution of Atheism The God Delusion God Is Not Great Letter to a Christian Nation The System of Nature Why I Am Not a Christian Why I Am Not a Muslim Why I Am an Atheist List of irreligious organizations American Atheists American Humanist Association Atheist Alliance International British Humanist Association Center for Inquiry Freedom From Religion Foundation International Humanist and Ethical Union Rational Response Squad Reason Rally Recovering from Religion Brazilian Association of Atheists and Agnostics Related topics Countries by irreligion Secularism Parody or mock religions Parody religion Irreligion by country v t e Part of a series on Theism Types of faith Agnosticism Apatheism Atheism Deism Henotheism Ietsism Ignosticism Monotheism Monism Dualism Monolatry Kathenotheism Omnism Pandeism Panentheism Pantheism Polytheism Transtheism Specific conceptions Brahman Creator Demiurge Deus Father Form of the Good God Great Architect Monad Mother Summum bonum Supreme Being Sustainer The Lord Trinity Tawhid Ditheism Monism Personal Unitarianism In particular religions Abrahamic Judaism Christianity Islam Baháʼí Faith Mormonism Mandaeism Samaritanism Indo-Iranian Hinduism Buddhism Jainism Sikhism Yungdrung Bon Zoroastrianism Chinese Tian Shangdi Hongjun Laozu Attributes Eternalness Existence Gender Names ("God") Omnibenevolence Omnipotence Omnipresence Omniscience Aseity Transcendence Experiences Practices Belief Esotericism Faith Fideism Gnosis Hermeticism Metaphysics Mysticism Prayer Revelation Worship Related topics Euthyphro dilemma God complex God gene Theology Ontology Problem of evil (theodicy) Religion philosophy texts Portrayals of God in popular media Religion portal v t e There are numerous definitions of pantheism. Some consider it a theological and philosophical position concerning God.[14]: p.8  A doctrine which identifies God with the universe, or regards the universe as a manifestation of God. Pantheism is the view that everything is part of an all-encompassing, immanent God. All forms of reality may then be considered either modes of that Being, or identical with it.[15] Some hold that pantheism is a non-religious philosophical position. To them, pantheism is the view that the Universe (in the sense of the totality of all existence) and God are identical.[16] History[edit] Pre-modern times[edit] Early traces of pantheist thought can be found within animistic beliefs and tribal religions throughout the world as an expression of unity with the divine, specifically in beliefs that have no central polytheist or monotheist personas. Hellenistic theology makes early recorded reference to pantheism within the ancient Greek religion of Orphism, where pan (the all) is made cognate with the creator God Phanes (symbolizing the universe),[17] and with Zeus, after the swallowing of Phanes.[18] Pantheistic tendencies existed in a number of Gnostic groups, with pantheistic thought appearing throughout the Middle Ages.[19] These included the beliefs of mystics such as Ortlieb of Strasbourg, David of Dinant, Amalric of Bena, and Eckhart.[19]: pp. 620–621  The Catholic Church has long regarded pantheistic ideas as heresy.[20][21] Sebastian Franck was considered an early Pantheist.[22] Giordano Bruno, an Italian friar who evangelized about a transcendent and infinite God, was burned at the stake in 1600 by the Roman Inquisition. He has since become known as a celebrated pantheist and martyr of science.[23][24] Baruch Spinoza[edit] Main article: Baruch Spinoza § Philosophy The philosophy of Baruch Spinoza is often regarded as pantheism.[14][25] In the West, pantheism was formalized as a separate theology and philosophy based on the work of the 17th-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza.[14]: p.7  Spinoza was a Dutch philosopher of Portuguese descent raised in the Sephardi Jewish community in Amsterdam.[26] He developed highly controversial ideas regarding the authenticity of the Hebrew Bible and the nature of the Divine, and was effectively excluded from Jewish society at age 23, when the local synagogue issued a herem against him.[27] A number of his books were published posthumously, and shortly thereafter included in the Catholic Church's Index of Forbidden Books. The breadth and importance of Spinoza's work would not be realized for many years – as the groundwork for the 18th-century Enlightenment[28] and modern biblical criticism,[29] including modern conceptions of the self and the universe.[30] In the posthumous Ethics, "Spinoza wrote the last indisputable Latin masterpiece, and one in which the refined conceptions of medieval philosophy are finally turned against themselves and destroyed entirely."[31] In particular, he opposed René Descartes' famous mind–body dualism, the theory that the body and spirit are separate.[32] Spinoza held the monist view that the two are the same, and monism is a fundamental part of his philosophy. He was described as a "God-intoxicated man," and used the word God to describe the unity of all substance.[32] This view influenced philosophers such as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, who said, "You are either a Spinozist or not a philosopher at all."[33] Spinoza earned praise as one of the great rationalists of 17th-century philosophy[34] and one of Western philosophy's most important thinkers.[35] Although the term "pantheism" was not coined until after his death, he is regarded as the most celebrated advocate of the concept.[36] Ethics was the major source from which Western pantheism spread.[10] Heinrich Heine, in his Concerning the History of Religion and Philosop contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 43 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Pantheism responseCode 3 200
