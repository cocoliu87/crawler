New requests for assistance should instead be directed to either the Teahouse (an area specifically for new users) or the help desk.

Editor assistance Shortcuts WP:ASSIST WP:EA Editor assistance is intended as an informal method of requesting one-to-one advice, feedback, and counseling from another editor who may be more experienced about Wikipedia's policies and guidelines, and how they may apply to the issue or situation that you are experiencing. This process can also help in resolving disputes. You may want to read the list of frequently asked questions before making a request; in some cases, you may find the answer you're looking for by reading that. What to expect from assistance[edit] Shortcut WP:EA#EXPECT Help in learning how to work with the community's standards, norms, and policies to achieve consensus, and how to correctly and non-disruptively make use of policy and process. Help to understand what is and is not appropriate behavior, and how to deal civilly and rationally with other editors—including those with whom you may disagree. However, do not expect an assistant to automatically "take your side" in a dispute. The role of an editorial assistant is to provide advice. Note: If you're being disruptive or unreasonable, the assistant may let you know this. You are not required to do anything the assistant says, but advice from the assistant, as from any experienced editor, should be carefully considered. While honest mistakes are acceptable and sometimes expected, that doesn't mean abusive behavior will be overlooked. Be aware: If you cause disruption after being advised not to, you may be refused further assistance. Contacting another editor directly[edit] Getting help[edit] If you're here to look for a specific person to ask for help, please make a request to only one person from the list below by posting on their talk page. If you get no response in a day or two, you can try another person. Please remember that some editors may be inactive (temporarily or indefinitely) or may be otherwise indisposed and unable to respond. If you would rather make a general request from anyone who is available, please post it here at the Teahouse (an area specifically for new users) or the help desk instead. Editors willing to assist If you are a user who is prepared to be contacted directly, you can list your name here along with a short description of what help you can provide. If you prefer to help with the requests that are posted directly here, adding your name to the list is not required. Please read the advice for assistants. If you are no longer active here, please remove yourself from the list. Editors willing to provide assistance[edit] I'll help to the best of my ability.--SKATER Is Back 15:40, 4 May 2012 (UTC)Reply[reply] My only purpose is to assist any side of a dispute that has the proper citations and references.

Seraphimblade Talk to me 12:02, 2 April 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Also happy to help in any way I can. Especially the Wikipedia:Five Pillars, and how they (and the associated sub-pages) directly impact an editor. (See also my user page and userbox page for my interests and such.) I also prefer being contacted on my talk page. Incidentally, I like how this "system" is currently laid out. - jc37 13:10, 3 April 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] I'm specialized in article writing.

When editors clash there is usually a resolution that benefits and strengthens the article. Take away the bad emotion and replace with good faith and an edit dispute becomes a constructive peer review. SilkTork 20:32, 14 April 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply] Would like to help.
