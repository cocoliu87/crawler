However, Israel and other legal scholars dispute this.[3] The Gaza Strip (/ˈɡɑːzə/ ⓘ;[6] Arabic: قِطَاعُ غَزَّةَ Qiṭāʿ Ġazzah [qɪˈtˤɑːʕ ˈɣaz.za]), or simply Gaza, is the smaller of the two Palestinian territories (the other being the West Bank). On the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, Gaza is bordered by Egypt on the southwest and Israel on the east and north. The British Empire relinquished its control of Palestine during the 1948 Palestine war (the first of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict), when Gaza became a refuge for many Arabs. During the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel began a decades-long military occupation of the Palestinian territories. The mid-1990s Oslo Accords established the Palestinian Authority to govern both territories, which it did under Palestinian nationalist party Fatah until that party's electoral defeat in 2006 to militant Sunni Islamic organization Hamas. That group took over the governance of Gaza in a battle the next year,[7][8][9][10] subsequently warring with Israel. Israel unilaterally withdrew its military forces from Gaza and dismantled its settlements in 2005 and implemented a temporary blockade of Gaza that same year; the blockade, supported by Egypt through restrictions on its land border with Gaza, became indefinite after the 2007 Hamas takeover of the governance of Gaza. Despite the Israeli disengagement, the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and many human-rights organizations continue to consider Gaza to be held under Israeli military occupation, due to what they consider Israel's effective military control over the territory; Israel disputes that it occupies the territory and the Israeli Supreme Court has found that since the disengagement Israel no longer occupies Gaza.[11][12][13] The land, sea, and air blockade prevents people and goods from freely entering or leaving the territory, resulting in a $17 million loss in exports and leading to Gaza often being called an "open-air prison".[14][15] The UN, as well as at least 19 human-rights organizations, have urged Israel to lift the blockade.[16] The Gaza Strip is 41 kilometres (25 miles) long, from 6 to 12 km (3.7 to 7.5 mi) wide, and has a total area of 365 km2 (141 sq mi).[17][18] With around 2 million Palestinians[19] on approximately 365 km2 (141 sq mi) of land, Gaza has a high population density (comparable to that of Hong Kong).[20][21] The majority of Palestinians in Gaza, which contains eight refugee camps, are descendants of refugees who fled or were expelled from the area that became Israel after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.[22] Sunni Muslims make up most of Gaza's population, with a Palestinian Christian minority. Gaza has an annual population growth rate of 1.99% (2023 est.), the 39th-highest in the world.[23] Gaza's unemployment rate is among the highest in the world, with an overall unemployment rate of 46% and a youth unemployment rate of ~70%, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, while the population has one of the highest literacy rates in the world.[24][25][26] Gaza City skyline, 2007 History See also: History of Gaza Historically part of the Palestine region, the area was controlled by the Ottoman Empire; in 1906 the Ottomans and the British Empire set the region's international border with Egypt.[27] With the defeat of the Central Powers in World War I and the subsequent partition of the Ottoman Empire, the British deferred the governance of the Gaza Strip area to Egypt (which declined the responsibility).[28] Britain itself ruled Mandatory Palestine from 1920 until 1948. 1948–1959: All-Palestine government Main articles: All-Palestine Protectorate and All-Palestine Government During the 1948 Palestine war and more specifically the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, tens of thousands of Palestinian refugees went to the Gaza Strip.[29] By the end of the war, 25% of Mandatory Palestine's Arab population was in Gaza, though it constituted only 1% of the land.[30] The same year, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) was established to administer various refugee programmes.[31] On 22 September 1948 (near the end of the Arab–Israeli War), in the Egyptian-occupied Gaza City, the Arab League proclaimed the All-Palestine Government, partly to limit Transjordan's influence over Palestine. The All-Palestine Protectorate was quickly recognized by six of the Arab League's then-seven members (excluding Transjordan): Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen.[32] It was not recognized by any other country.[citation needed] After the cessation of hostilities, the Israel–Egypt Armistice Agreement of 24 February 1949 established the line of separation between Egyptian and Israeli forces, as well as the modern boundary between Gaza and Israel, which both signatories declared not to be an international border. The southern border with Egypt was unchanged.[27] Palestinians living in Gaza or Egypt were issued All-Palestine passports. Egypt did not offer them citizenship. From the end of 1949, they received aid directly from UNRWA. During the Suez Crisis (1956), Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula were occupied by Israeli troops, who withdrew under international pressure. The All-Palestine government was accused of being little more than a façade for Egyptian control, with negligible independent funding or influence. It subsequently moved to Cairo and dissolved in 1959 by decree of Egyptian President Gamal Abdul Nasser.[citation needed] 1956–1957: Israeli occupation During the 1956 Suez Crisis (Second Arab–Israeli war), Israel invaded the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula. On 3 November, the IDF attacked Egyptian and Palestinian forces at Khan Yunis.[33] The city of Khan Younis resisted being captured, and Israel responded with a heavy bombing campaign that inflicted heavy civilian casualties.[34] After a fierce battle, the Israeli 37th Armored Brigade's Sherman tanks broke through the heavily fortified lines outside of Khan Yunis held by the 86th Palestinian Brigade.[35] After some street-fighting with Egyptian soldiers and Palestinian fedayeen, Khan Yunis fell to the Israelis.[35] Upon capturing Khan Yunis, the IDF committed a massacre, known as the Khan Yunis massacre.[36] Israeli troops started executing unarmed Palestinians, mostly civilians; in one instance men were lined up against walls in central square and executed with machine guns.[37] The claims of a massacre were reported to the United Nations General Assembly on 15 December 1956 by the Director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, Henry Labouisse, who reported from "trustworthy sources" that 275 people were killed in the massacre of which 140 were refugees and 135 local residents.[38][39] On 12 November, days after the hostilities had ended, Israel killed 111 people in the Rafah refugee camp during Israeli operations, in an event known as the Rafah massacre, provoking international criticism.[40][41] Israel ended the occupation in March 1957, amid international pressure. During the 4-month Israeli occupation, 900–1,231 people were killed.[42] According to French historian Jean-Pierre Filiu, 1% of the population of Gaza was killed, wounded, imprisoned or tortured during the occupation.[42] 1959–1967: Egyptian occupation Main article: Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt Che Guevara visiting Gaza in 1959 After the dissolution of the All-Palestine Government in 1959, under the excuse of pan-Arabism, Egypt continued to occupy the Gaza Strip until 1967. Egypt never annexed the Gaza Strip, but instead treated it as a controlled territory and administered it through a military governor.[43] The influx of over 200,000 refugees from former Mandatory Palestine, roughly a quarter of those who fled or were expelled from their homes during, and in the aftermath of, the 1948 Arab–Israeli War into Gaza[44] resulted in a dramatic decrease in the standard of living. Because the Egyptian government restricted movement to and from the Gaza Strip, its inhabitants could not look elsewhere for gainful employment.[45] 1967: Israeli occupation See also: Israeli Military Governorate In June 1967, during the Six-Day War, Israel Defense Forces captured the Gaza Strip.
