(August 2017) (template removal help) Multilingual Multiscript Plant Name Database (MMPND) is a multilingual database of names of taxa of plants. The MMPND is located at the University of Melbourne, where it is managed and maintained by Michel H. Porcher. This database includes the names of taxa of more than 900 genera of higher plants (not counting mushrooms). In addition to the scientific names and synonyms, it contains the terms of the taxa in 82 languages (The website states it has 70, with 40 or more dialects included). The MMPND is mentioned in many taxa of GRIN-Global (Germplasm Resources Information Network) References.[1] The International Plant Names Index (IPNI)[2] mentions: "Multilingual Multiscript Plant Name Database is searchable in any language and script and holds a lot of information including an index of medicinal plants". The primary focus was to catalog cultivated plants, which are considered the most useful. The database currently contains the names of plants of economic importance as well as names of savage plants. The last update is indicated for each genus. External links[edit] Multilingual Multiscript Plant Name Database (Official website) References[edit] ^ "Porcher, M. H. et al.
