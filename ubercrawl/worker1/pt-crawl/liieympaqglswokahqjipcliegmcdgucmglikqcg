Today Sodexo is on the Fortune Global 500 list[10] and the second largest employer among all French multi-national corporations.[11] Throughout the 1970s, the company expanded in France and internationally; first in Belgium, then Africa, and finally the Middle East.[citation needed] After an initial public offering on the Paris Bourse in 1983, the firm continued its expansion into North America, South America, Japan, South Africa and Russia.[12] In 1994, on October 31, Sodexo began operations in India. Currently[when?] Sodexo India has over 40,135 employees. The head office is situated in Goregaon, Mumbai.[citation needed] In 1997, Société d'Exploitation Hotelière's holding company changed its name to Sodexho,[13] and joined forces with Universal Ogden Services, the leading remote-site service provider in the U.S.[13] On January 11, 1995, Sodexo S.A. acquired food company Gardner Merchant Ltd. from Cinven and CVC Capital Partners.[14] In 1998, Sodexho merged with Marriott Management Services, at the time one of the largest food services companies in North America. Included in the merger was a name change to Sodexho Marriott Services.[clarification needed][15] The merger helped the company become one of the largest food services providers in the United States.[13] In June 2001, Sodexho acquired complete control of Sodexho Marriott Services.[16] In 2002, Sodexho was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but the company withdrew its listing in 2007.[17] As of 2017, the company is listed on Euronext Paris under the symbol SW[18] and trades stocks over-the-counter under the symbols SDXOF[19] and SDXAY.[20] In 2005, Michel Landel was appointed Chief Executive Officer, succeeding Pierre Bellon, who continues as Chairman of the Board of Directors. In the summer of 2006, the company made headlines for concluding a deal with retired NBA Hall of Famer and entrepreneur, Magic Johnson and Magic Food Provisions, a subsidiary of Magic Johnson Enterprises. The initiative includes a marketing agreement and the formation of SodexhoMAGIC, LLC, a new joint venture that is 51 percent owned by Johnson.[21] In 2007, Sodexho launched its catering arm in United Kingdom schools, using the brand name "For you...".[22] In 2008, Sodexho changed its name to Sodexo, dropping the h in order to make the name easier to pronounce in many languages worldwide.[23] In August 2009, Sodexo acquired the in-home care services company, Comfort Keepers.[24][25] Comfort Keepers provides non-medical, in-home care for adults and seniors. It is an international franchise system with locally owned and operated franchise offices, and is headquartered in Dayton, Ohio. The company was launched in 1998.[26] Comfort Keepers franchises are located throughout the United States, Canada, Australia, France, Ireland, Portugal, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. As of June 2016, Comfort Keepers had 500 franchisees running 750 offices in the United States and internationally.[27] Comfort Keepers was named by INC. Magazine as one of the fastest-growing franchise systems in the United States in 2007.[28] In 2016, Comfort Keepers was ranked number seven by Forbes as a "Top Franchise to Buy" in the lowest investment category.[29] The DiversityInc Top 50 Companies for Diversity is the leading assessment of diversity management in the US economy and globally. In 2010, Sodexo ranked number one. According to the report,[30] Sodexo "has led every other company in its ability to implement measure and assess strong internal diversity initiatives". In 2010, Sodexo entered into two new partnerships: the first one with United Coffee, who will supply Sodexo with machines as well as fair-trade certified coffees; the other one with Numi, from which Sodexo has selected 100% organic teas.[citation needed] In 2011, Sodexo entered an eight-year contract with the US government, by which the company committed itself to provide food services to 51 United States Marine Corps mess halls.[31] In January 2016, Lorna C. Donatone was appointed head of Sodexo's North American business operations and CEO of its school operations worldwide.[32] In 2018, shareholders meeting, Denis Machuel replaced Michel Landel as CEO.[33] On the death of Pierre Bellon in 2022,[34] his daughter Sophie Bellon took over the roles of chairwoman of the board of directors and CEO.[35] Food services and facilities management[edit] Crossroads Cafe at LaBelle High School, operated by Sodexo.[36] Sodexo typically sets up various stations offering different foods in its cafeterias, as can be seen in the photo.[37] Sodexo offerings range from food service operations including staff restaurants, catering, executive dining, vending, and meal delivery, to integrated facilities management services that include both soft services (reception, concierge, cleaning, pantry, laundry, groundskeeping, waste management, vendor management, etc.) and hard services (HVAC systems, electrical systems including substations up to 220kV, energy efficiency & sustainability services, plumbing/water treatment plant/sewage treatment plant operation, annual equipment operation & maintenance contracts, project management, etc.). Service vouchers and cards[edit] One of the top-two companies worldwide in this sector,[38][citation needed] Sodexo provides companies and public authorities with meal passes, restaurant vouchers, mobility passes, leisure passes, book cards, and training vouchers. In China and the US, it operates a stored-value card system in cooperation with multiple restaurants. Freedompay is used to power some of these deployments.[39] Name change[edit] The company changed its official name from Sodexho Alliance to simply Sodexo after a shareholder vote at the company's annual general meeting on 22 January 2008.[40] The reason for removing the letter 'h' from Sodexho, cited in the group's 2007 annual report, is that "in certain languages an 'x' followed by an 'h' is difficult to pronounce". The company's corporate website also states that it draws emphasis away from the hotel services industry they were once associated with, as they now focus on many other directions. The Sod part of the name remains unchanged. The logo of the company was also changed, dropping the five stars to a single star. The bar of the letter 'x' is also now curved, like a smile, supposedly suggestive of the company's claimed desire to constantly seek and increase the satisfaction of their clients.[40] Controversy[edit] In 2009, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) launched a United States nationwide campaign[41] against Sodexo with the stated objective of improving wage and job standards. In 2010, the SEIU recruited students at many U.S. colleges to support strikes and demonstrations in protest of Sodexo's alleged unfair labor practices including anti-union behavior and paying low wages.[42][43] Although one series of strikes at the University of Pittsburgh led to the negotiation of higher wages and lower cost health insurance plans for the cafeteria workers,[44][45][46] none of the Sodexo accounts targeted by the SEIU have unionized or requested an election vote. According to a statement from Sodexo, the SEIU engaged in a smear campaign in an effort to drive out rival labor unions that have traditionally operated in the foodservice industry as well as for general publicity.[47] Sodexo filed a lawsuit in March 2011 under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act accusing the SEIU of "engaging in illegal tactics in its effort to unionize workers".[48] During the trial, it was revealed that the SEIU had written and distributed a manual to its staff detailing how "outside pressure can involve jeopardizing relationships between the employer and lenders, investors, stockholders, customers, client contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 40 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Sodexo responseCode 3 200
