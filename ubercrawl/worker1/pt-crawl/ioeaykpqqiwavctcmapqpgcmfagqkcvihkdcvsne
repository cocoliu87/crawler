Min Aung Hlaing has delegated his legislative power to the SAC, which he chairs.[5] It has formed a provisional administration, also led by Min Aung Hlaing as Prime Minister of Myanmar.[6] The Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH) has designated the SAC as a "terrorist group",[7] and SAC's legitimacy is contested by the competing National Unity Government of Myanmar (NUG). History[edit] Formation[edit] The State Administration Council was formed by Min Aung Hlaing on 2 February 2021 with 11 members in the aftermath of the 2021 Myanmar coup d'état.[1][8][9] On 3 February, five civilian members were added to the council.[10][11][12] On 17 March, a civilian joined the council.[13] On 30 March, a military officer and a civilian joined the council.[14] As of late August, in total, the council comprises nine military officers and ten civilians.[15] In the leadup to and in the aftermath of the coup d'état, the military had made overtures to political parties allied with the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), the military proxy party.[16][17] On 14 August 2020, 34 pro-military parties including USDP had met with Min Aung Hlaing to seek assurances from the military to intervene in the event of electoral integrity issues during the upcoming 2020 Myanmar general election.[18][16] Min Aung Hlaing's remarks during the meeting raised concerns that the military had threatened to stage a coup.[19] As of late August 2021, ten civilian members of the SAC include eight party's politicians, Sai Lone Saing and Shwe Kyein of the USDP, Mahn Nyein Maung of the Kayin People's Party (KPP), Thein Nyunt of the New National Democracy Party (NNDP), Khin Maung Swe of the National Democratic Force (NDF), Aye Nu Sein of the Arakan National Party (ANP), Banyar Aung Moe of the Mon Unity Party (MUP) and Saw Daniel, formerly of the Kayah State Democratic Party (KySDP).[15][20][21] Khin Maung Swe and Thein Nyunt had co-founded NDF, a National League for Democracy (NLD) splinter group, while Mahn Nyein Maung was a former leader of the Karen National Union.[21] Several organisations have distanced themselves from civilian members of the SAC. Following Mahn Nyein Maung's appointment, the KNU distanced itself from him, and reiterated its opposition to the military coup.[22] On 4 February, KySDP announced it had dismissed Saw Daniel from the party for accepting the appointment, and called for the Burmese military to honor the 2020 election results.[20] On 5 February, SAC formed a press team led by Brigadier-General Zaw Min Tun and deputy Thet Swe.[23] Sanctions[edit] On 11 February, the United States government imposed sanctions on six military officers of the SAC, namely Min Aung Hlaing, Soe Win, Mya Tun Oo, Tin Aung San, Aung Lin Dwe, and Ye Win Oo. On the same day, Soe Htut, who later became a member of the SAC, was also sanctioned.[24] On 22 February, the United States government imposed sanctions on two military officers, Maung Maung Kyaw and Moe Myint Tun.[25] On 17 May and 2 July, the U.S. government imposed sanctions on four and three civilian members of the SAC, respectively.[26][27] On 17 May, the United States government designated the SAC as an object to sanctions.[26] As of late August 2021, of all SAC members, only three civilians, Jeng Phang Naw Taung, Moung Har and Shwe Kyein, have not been sanctioned by the United States government. Government reshuffle[edit] SAC has terminated numerous civil servants across multiple government bodies, including the Supreme Court,[28] union-level ministries,[29] the Naypyidaw Council, and Union Civil Service Board.[30] It has quickly appointed replacements, including union ministers,[31][32][33] mayors,[34] agency executives, members of the Central Bank of Myanmar,[35][36] Union Civil Service Board,[37] judges,[38][39] and Supreme Court justices.[40][41] On 8 February, SAC appointed a new Constitutional Tribunal.[42] On 11 February, SAC formed State and Region Administration Councils and their leaders for Myanmar's 14 states and regions.[43][44] It also appointed military officers to run Self-Administered Zone Councils for the country's autonomous zones.[45] 2 August reshuffle[edit] Under Order No 57/2023, the State Administration Council was reformed with 18 members. Under Order No 55/2023, U Maung Ko and Dr Aung Kyaw Min were retired from their duty assignment as SAC members. Under Order No 56/2023, Dr Kyaw Tun is transferred and assigned as a member of the SAC's Central Advisory Body. Under Order No 58/2023, Union Chief Justice U Htun Htun Oo is retired from duty assignment. Under Order No 59/2023, Union Minister for Religious Affairs and Culutre U Ko Ko, Union Minister for Electric Power U Thaung Han, Union Auditor-General U Tin Oo, Anti-Corruption Commission Chairman Dr Htay Aung and Myanmar National Human Rights Commission Chairman U Hla Myint were retired from their duty assignment. Under Order No 60/2023, Union Minister of Energy U Myo Myint Oo and Union Minister for Labour Dr Pwint San were retired from their duty assignment. Resistance and protests[edit] Main article: 2021 Myanmar protests On 9 February, a 36-page draft cybersecurity law proposed by SAC was circulated to Myanmar's mobile operators and telecoms license holders for industry feedback.[46] The draft bill would make internet providers accountable for preventing or removing content that "cause[s] hatred, destroy unity and tranquility" and would require ISPs to store user data at a government-prescribed location for a minimum of 3 years.[47][46] A coalition of 150 civil service organizations publicly denounced the bill for violating the fundamental rights to freedom of expression, data protection, and privacy, and other democratic norms in the digital space, and for granting state authorities the ability to ban unfavorable content, restrict ISPs, and intercept data.[46] On 10 February, the SAC conducted late-night raids to arrest senior civilian politicians and election officials throughout the country, in an attempt to neutralize the NLD.[48] High-profile arrests include the detentions of the Chief Ministers of Tanintharyi Region, Shan, Chin, Kachin, Karen and Rakhine States, as well as dozens of township- and district-level election officials.[48] On 11 February, SAC remitted the sentences of 23,314 prisoners.[49] Among those released were supporters of the assassin who killed Ko Ni, the NLD's legal advisor.[50] The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners expressed serious concern that the amnesty was intended to clear prison space in order to detain political prisoners.[51] A recent spate of crimes, including arson, has coincided with the timing of the amnesty.[52] On 14 February, SAC amended existing privacy protection laws, which effectively enables the Commander-in-Chief to temporarily restrict or suspend the fundamental rights of citizens, including warrantless arrests and searches, until power is transferred to a newly elected government.[52] SAC also enacted Law 3/2021, which requires all residents to register overnight guests outside of their official household with their respective township or ward administrators.[52] The military era law had previously been repealed by the NLD-led government.[52] On 12 February, the Ministry of Information sent directives to the Myanmar Press Council,[53] a media-adjudication and media-dispute settling body, that the media must report ethically and avoid instigating public unrest but the gradual resignation of twenty three out of twenty six members following the military coup has made contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 62 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/State_Administration_Council responseCode 3 200
