These rules are the earliest that are definitely known to have been written. They are a major step in the evolution of rugby league and rugby union; not to mention Australian rules football, American football, Gaelic football, etc. The Rugby School rules make a clear distinction between the "handling" game and the "dribbling" game. Dribbling is running with the ball at one's feet. Although Eton College rules allow the ball to be touched and controlled by hand, they do not allow running with the ball in the hand or passing of the ball by hand. So, whereas Rugby School has effectively created the first "handling game" rules, Eton could have created the earliest rules of the "dribbling game". Introduction of referees at Eton. Linesmen at the time are called umpires.
