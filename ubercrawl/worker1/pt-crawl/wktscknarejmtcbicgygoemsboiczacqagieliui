On 7 November, rebel groups in the south announced Operation 1107 in support of 1027, particularly focused on Kayah State.[21] Objectives[edit] The Three Brotherhood Alliance released a joint statement declaring the start of Operation 1027, on 27 October 2023. The alliance had the combined capability to draw on 15,000 troops.[22] The statement detailed the primary objectives of the operation, being to: Safeguard the lives of civilians Assert [their] right to self-defence Maintain control over [their] territory Respond resolutely to ongoing artillery attacks and airstrikes perpetrated by the State Administration Council Eradicat[e] the oppressive military rule [Combat] the widespread online gambling fraud that has plagued Myanmar, particularly along the China–Myanmar border[23][24] The cyber-scamming industry has plagued Myanmar since the February 2021 coup. The military junta has worked with Chinese gangs to traffic over 120,000 people into the country, where they are forced to work in inhumane and degrading conditions. The industry has earned billions of dollars in revenue for the junta and the gangs. China has exerted pressure on the regime to end the practice, and have been actively working with the Three Brotherhood Alliance, whose members are all dependent on China for military equipment, to extricate individuals with pending Chinese warrants.[25][4][8][26] According to an emergency meeting of the National Defence and Security council, the junta leader Min Aung Hlaing noted that long-standing tensions and scam call centers along the border were exacerbated by Chinese investment. The State Administration Council believes the operation and attack to be targeted towards damaging China-Myanmar relations from its focus on disrupting the opening of a major bridge in Kunlong Township and the Union highway overland trade in general.[27] Timeline[edit] October[edit] 20 October[edit] The armed forces established by cybercrime ringleader[28] and former pro-military member of parliament Ming Xuechang [zh] massacred imprisoned fraudsters in northern Myanmar. There were reports that at least 80 people were killed, and there were also reports that four Chinese undercover police officers were buried alive. This massacre became the trigger for Operation 1027.[29] 27 October[edit] At 4:00 am, the MNDAA attacked military bases in Kokang and reported that junta forces had been killed and some captured along with their weapons.[30] Reports indicated that the TNLA captured junta's 13 Mile Camp and Microweave Camp on the Namhkam-Namphatka Road in Namhkam Township.[31] The MNDAA reportedly had seized control of the town of Chinshwehaw and blocked the Lashio-Muse Highway and Lashio-Chin Shwe Haw Road to prevent the regime from bringing reinforcements along these routes.[32] The regime responded with aerial bombardments and heavy shelling.[33] SAC's spokesperson Major General Zaw Min Tun confirmed that fighting occurred near Hsenwi and some security police stations and militia stations were destroyed.[34] He also admitted that some security forces personnel were killed and injured, but did not provide the exact number. According to Al Jazeera, the German news agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur reported about 20 soldiers were killed in an attack on one of the customs offices in Chinshwehaw.[16] A member of Luakkiang's police force reported that 17 police officers were killed after the MNDAA attacked checkpoints.[24] The Bamar People's Liberation Army (BPLA) stated it was involved in the operation alongside the Brotherhood Alliance, which has been training BPLA fighters.[35] AA engaged in multiple skirmishes with junta forces in Htigyaing Township, a township bordering northwestern Shan State in Sagaing Region. AA claimed multiple junta casualties after clashes south of Mt. Mawkun.[36][17] Nine rebel groups raided a military checkpoint on the Taungtha-Myingyan road in the Taungtha Township. The groups used drones to bomb the base before their assault, and claimed to have killed 20 junta troops. Other rebels ambushed a junta convoy bringing reinforcements, but were forced to withdraw.[9][18] A child and a woman were killed and at least 5 others were injured due to an artillery strike on Namphatka village in Kutkai Township.[31] 28 October[edit] According to rebel sources, the MNDAA had ambushed junta soldiers coming from Hopang and seized three junta outposts — with two of them near the China-Myanmar border in the town of Mong Ko. They also claimed to have defeated paratroopers dropped near Chinshwehaw and captured paradropped weaponry.[9] The TNLA claimed that it had seized three outposts in Namhkam Township and two outposts in the Lashio area. Junta spokespeople acknowledged losing certain outposts and expressed their desire for peace and stability.[37] About 600 IDPs from Lashio were displaced by heavy weapons and gunfire through the 27th and 28th. Clashes have disrupted roads and villages near Lashio, including the Hopaik toll gate on the Lashio-Muse Highway. However, Lashio itself remains mostly untouched.[38] The Mandalay-Lashio road and the Hopaik Toll Gate, which saw fighting on the 27th, returned to normal on the 28th. Fighting, however, continued to occur further away from Mandalay towards Kyaukme, Hsenwi, and Kutkai.[39] 29 October[edit] Clashes in Htigyaing Township continued until 29 October with the junta dispatching air force planes to engage in the area.[36] A TNLA-led force, alongside Mandalay PDF  contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 48 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Operation_1027 responseCode 3 200
