Articles for improvement[edit] current suggestions (with relevant date) Please list articles here that need improvement before listing at Wikipedia:Selected anniversaries. Anyone may list an article, preferably discussing on the talk page (or here briefly) why it fails Selected_anniversaries_criteria. July 7: Raid of the Redeswire (no footnotes) July 7: sliced bread (original research, US focus, formatting issues) August 1: Swiss National Day (needs referencing throughout) August 1 (1927): Nanchang Uprising (needs referencing) August 31 (1945) Liberal Party of Australia (needs referencing) September 5 (1867) 150th anniversary of birth of Composer Amy Beach (I think this is a good article since it draws extensively from the best print biography. However there is a website that could be inclded as an external reference. www.amybeach.org) November 9 (1989) Fall of the Berlin Wall This is a new article that is currently at DYK with a request for scheduling on November 9th, but it doesn't look like the rules prevent it from being here too? It's in good enough shape for DYK, but I'm thinking it could get a lot of attention and am hoping it can get some eyes on it before then. October checks[edit] Just setting up WP:OTD/OCT now.

Edward-Woodrow :) [talk] 21:28, 8 September 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Thanks for taking a look, and great work! I'll add a fourth b/d to that list when I go through soon. Regarding your earlier September ones, that's a little trickier -- usually they'd be changed much closer to the date, so doing the 2024 ones now makes it hard to keep track of it when doing September 2024 in the future -- but thanks for looking at October.
