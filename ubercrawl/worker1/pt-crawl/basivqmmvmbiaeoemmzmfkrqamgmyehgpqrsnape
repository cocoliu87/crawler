In 2014, LNA launched Operation Dignity, a military campaign against the General National Congress and armed militias and Islamist militant organizations. When the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) was established in Tripoli, part of the Libyan military forces were named the Libyan Army to contrast with the other part that retained the LNA identity. In the Second Libyan Civil War, the LNA is loyal to that part of the Libyan House of Representatives that meets in Tobruk, internationally recognised until October 2015. It fights against the Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries, as well as Islamic State in Libya which is a common enemy for both LNA and the Libyan Army. About half of the LNA consists of militias[1][7] including Madkhali (Salafist) militias[8] and Sudanese, Chadian[1][7] and Russian mercenaries, which together constitute part of the LNA's effective forces.[9] The LNA possesses its own air force. Most of the Libyan Navy is loyal to the GNA.[10][7] Interventions in the political system by the LNA include the late 2016 replacement of nine elected municipal councils out of a total of 27, replacing elected mayors by mostly military individuals[11][12][13] and, according to witnesses cited by The Independent, the 17 July 2019 abduction of House of Representatives member Seham Sergiwa at her home in Benghazi by the 106th Brigade.[14][15] The LNA stated that it was not responsible for the Sergiwa abduction.[14] Name[edit] In November 2019, the United Nations Panel of Experts on Libya established under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 started using the name Haftar Armed Forces (HAF) to replace the name Libyan National Army to refer to "all armed groups associated with Haftar". It also chose to use lower case regarding "brigades" and "battalions" in order to avoid giving them "the legitimacy of being a formed military unit of a government".[4]: 6  Allies[edit] Haftar and the LNA is de facto backed by the governments of Egypt, Russia and the United Arab Emirates.[16][17][18][19][20] France has also provided tacit backing for Haftars forces. France carried out unprecedented air strikes by its Airforce on Chadian opposition fighters, which are LNA's biggest opponents. This resulted in a public dispute with Italy, which is supporting the Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripolis.[17] Russia is Haftar's most committed ally. In May 2020 the US Africa Command (AFRICOM) stated that Russia had deployed at least 14 MiG planes to the country. The plans were supported by private military contractors of Wagner Group and supporting the LNA.[21][22][23] Structure[edit] ground forces regular forces Special Forces military intelligence militias foreign units LNA component of the Libyan Air Force naval forces: coastal patrol vessels[7] Ranks[edit] Main article: Military ranks of Libya Leadership[edit] Khalifa Haftar was made head of the armed forces of Libya on 2 March 2015,[6] remaining as leader of the Libyan National Army after the split between the LNA and the Government of National Accord (GNA).

It numbers a few thousand and reports to the Ministry of Defence. It is popular in Benghazi, particularly in light of its opposition to Islamist Ansar al-Sharia group and because it is seen as a symbol of the reborn Libyan armed forces.[30] Militias[edit] Madkhali militias in the LNA include the Tawhid Battalion commanded by Izz al-Din al-Tarhuni; the Tariq Ibn Ziyad Brigade, the Subul al-Salam group and the al-Wadi Brigade.[31] LNA groups from Sabratha, Sorman, Tiji and Badr, towns in which Madkhali preachers were active and supported Haftar, are mostly Madkhali Salafists.[27] During the 2019–20 Western Libya campaign, the LNA was allied with the al-Kaniyat militia in Tarhuna.[32][33][34][35][36] The number of auxiliary LNA forces (militias and mercenaries) was estimated in May 2019 as 18000 by Jason Pack of the Institute for International Political Studies.[7] Foreign mercenaries[edit] Foreign mercenaries operating during 2019 Western Libya offensive on behalf of the LNA include Sudanese, Chadians and Russians.[31] Sudanese from the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (Minnawi) were present in Libya starting in March 2015 and fought on behalf of the LNA in 2016. SLM (Minnawi) planned on leaving Libya in early 2017.[37]: 115  Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (al-Nur) fighters fought on behalf of the LNA, with 1500 personnel in Libya in mid-2016.[37]: 115  Involvement of Sudanese mercenaries continued in 2018.[38]: 9, 79, 80  On 25 July 2019, 1000 members of the Sudanese Rapid Support Forces, widely attributed to be responsible for the 3 June 2019 Khartoum massacre,[39] arrived in Libya and were expected to number 4000 in total.[40] Chadians from the Rally of Democratic Forces (French: Rassemblement des Forces Démocratique) were recruited by the LNA in late 2015,[1] especially in the southern part of Libya.[31] There were an estimated 200 Russian Wagner Group mercenaries in the LNA in 2019.[35][34][33][32][36] On 1 January 2022, the 5+5 Libyan Joint Military Commission announced the deportation of 300 Sudanese mercenaries linked to the LNA from the Eastern Region.[41] History[edit] See also: Armed Forces of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya 2011–2013[edit] The Libyan National Army was founded in 2011 by the National Transitional Council, after forces aligned to it defeated the previous Libyan Army and overthrew Muammar Gaddafi's government. Supply depots and bases having been damaged during the civil war, the new army is faced with the challenge of having to rebuild much of the country's military infrastructure.[42] Yousef Mangoush was named as its first Chief of Staff on 2 January 2012 and the force saw its first major deployment on 23 February, when it was deployed to Kufra to intervene in a tribal conflict.[43] In November 2011, the National Transitional Council began the difficult process of restructuring the army, with military personnel who defected from the Gaddafi government and former rebel fighters of the National Liberation Army contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 54 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Libyan_National_Army responseCode 3 200
