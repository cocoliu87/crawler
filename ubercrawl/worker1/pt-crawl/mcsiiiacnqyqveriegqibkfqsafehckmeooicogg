SM90142 Category Ecclesiastical Elgin Cathedral is a historic ruin in Elgin, Moray, north-east Scotland. The cathedral, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, was established in 1224 on land granted by King Alexander II outside the burgh of Elgin and close to the River Lossie. It replaced the cathedral at Spynie, 3 kilometres (2 mi) to the north, which was served by a small chapter of eight clerics. By 1226, the new and developing cathedral was staffed with 18 canons increasing to 23 by 1242. A damaging fire in 1270 resulted in a significantly enlarged building. It remained unaffected by the Wars of Scottish Independence, but again suffered extensive fire damage in 1390 when attacked by Robert III's brother Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, also known as the Wolf of Badenoch. In 1402 the cathedral precinct again suffered an incendiary attack by the followers of the Lord of the Isles. As the cathedral grew, so did the number of clerics and craftsmen. The repairs following the 1270 and 1390 fires resulted in the doubling in length of the choir and the provision of outer aisles to both the nave and choir. Today, some parts of walls reach their full height while others are at foundation level, but the overall cruciform shape is still discernible. A mostly intact octagonal chapter house dates from the major enlargement after the fire of 1270. The gable wall above the double door entrance that links the west towers is nearly complete and was rebuilt after the fire of 1390. It accommodates a large window opening that now only contains stub tracery work and fragments of a large rose window. The transepts and the south aisle of the choir contain recessed and chest tombs with effigies of bishops and knights. The now grass-covered floor bears large flat slabs that mark the positions of early graves. The residences of the dignitaries, canons and chaplains that stood in the chanonry were also destroyed by the fires of 1270, 1390 and 1402 and formed part of the reconstruction process. Only the precentor's manse is substantially intact, while two others have been incorporated into private buildings. Both west front towers are mostly complete and were part of the initial phase of construction. A protective wall of massive proportions surrounded the cathedral precinct, but only two small sections survive. The wall had four access gates but only one, the Pans Port, still exists. By the time of the Scottish Reformation in 1560, the number of canons had increased to 25. After the Reformation the cathedral was abandoned, and its services transferred to Elgin's parish church of St Giles. After the removal of the lead waterproofing of the roof in 1567, the cathedral fell steadily into decay. The building was still largely intact in 1615, but a winter storm brought down the roof covering the eastern limb. In the spring of 1711, the central steeple above the crossing collapsed, taking the walls of the nave with it. Ownership was transferred from the Church to the Crown in 1689, but that made no difference to the building's continued deterioration. Only in the early years of the 19th century did the Crown begin the conservation process. The structural stabilisation continued until the end of the 20th century, with significant improvements to the two western towers. Early church in Moray[edit] Further information: Mormaer of Moray, Earl of Moray, and Bishop of Moray for more on medieval history of Moray The first cathedrals of Moray The Diocese of Moray was a regional bishopric, unlike the pre-eminent see of the Scottish church, St Andrews, which had evolved from a more ancient monastic Celtic church and administered scattered localities.[2] It is uncertain whether there were bishops of Moray before c. 1120,[3] but the first known prelate—possibly later translated to Dunkeld—was Gregory (or Giric, in Gaelic) and was probably bishop in name only.[4] Gregory was a signatory to the foundation charter of Scone Priory, issued by Alexander I (Alaxandair mac Maíl Choluim) between December 1123 and April 1124,[5] and again in a charter defining the legal rights of the same monastery.[6] He is recorded for the last time when he witnessed a charter granted by David I to Dunfermline Abbey in c. 1128.[7] These are the only known details of Gregory with no basis for later assertions that he was a promoted monk in a 'Pictish Church'.[8] After the suppression of Óengus of Moray's rebellion in 1130, King David must have regarded the continued existence of a bishopric in Moray as essential to the stability of the province.[9][10] However, the next bishop, William (1152–62) was an absentee titular bishop and King David's chaplain. Having been David's aide since 1136, it is likely that he did little to improve the stability of the see by the time he died in 1162.[11] Felix was the next bishop and is thought to have been prelate from 1166 to 1171, although no accurate dates are certain. There is very little known about his tenure, with only one instance of him appearing as a witness in a charter of William the Lion at his court held in Elgin.[12] Following Felix's death, Simon de Toeni, King William's kinsman and a former abbot of Coggeshall in Essex, became the next bishop. Bishop Simon was the first of the early bishops to adopt a hands-on approach to his diocese, and was said to be buried in Birnie Kirk, near Elgin, after his death on 17 September 1184, although this claim first emerged in the 18th century.[13] Simon's successor was Richard of Lincoln, once again a royal clerk, and one who struggled to build up the revenues of the bishopric during and after the insurgence of Domnall mac Uilleim (Donald MacWilliam).[13] Richard is regarded as the first significant resident bishop of the see.[4] During this early period, these bishops had no settled location for their cathedral, and sited it successively at the churches of Birnie, Kinneddar and Spynie.[14] Pope Innocent III issued an apostolic bull on 7 April 1206 that allowed bishop Brice de Douglas to fix his cathedral church at Spynie. The inauguration was held between spring 1207, and summer 1208.[15] A chapter of five dignitaries and three ordinary canons was authorised and based its constitution on that of Lincoln Cathedral.[16] Elgin emerged as the lay centre of the province under David I, who likely established the first castle in the town.[10][17] It may have been this castle, with its promise of better security, that prompted Brice to petition the Pope to move the seat from Spynie to Elgin before July 1216 .[18] Cathedral church at Elgin[edit] Despite Brice's earlier appeal, it was not until Andrew de Moravia's episcopate that Pope Honorius III issued his bull on 10 April 1224 authorising his legates Gilbert de Moravia, Bishop of Caithness; Robert, Abbot of Kinloss; and Henry, Dean of Ross to examine the suitability of transferring the cathedr contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 49 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Elgin_Cathedral responseCode 3 200
