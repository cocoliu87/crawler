The Ukrainian general staff conceded on 3 July that their forces had withdrawn from the city "in order to save the lives of Ukrainian defenders."[28][29][30][31] Lysychansk was the last Ukrainian stronghold to be captured in Luhansk Oblast, which Russia then claimed to fully control.[32] Background[edit] Main articles: Battle of Donbas (2022), Battle of the Siverskyi Donets, and Battle of Sievierodonetsk (2022) You can help expand this section with text translated from the corresponding article in Ukrainian.

First responders on the scene of a Russian airstrike in Lysychansk, 16 June 2022 The twin cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk are divided by the Donets river. The hilltop city of Lysychansk is located in the west bank and offered Ukrainian defenders the high ground.[33] On 11 April 2022, Russian forces shelled Lysychansk with heavy artillery, destroying four houses, killing one person, and injuring another three.[34] By 10 May, Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk had become the only remaining Ukrainian strongholds in the entirety of Luhansk Oblast.[33] During the battle of Sievierodonetsk, the three bridges connecting both cities were destroyed, affording Ukrainian defenders a better defensive position from Russian assaults across the river.[35] By 23 June, Russia had fully broken through in the south, winning the battle at Toshkivka[36] and making major gains south of Lysychansk. Russian forces captured Loskutivka [uk], Myrna Dolyna, Rai-Oleksandrivka [uk] and Pidlisne [uk] all on 22 June.[37][38] On 23 June, Russian forces cut off and surrounded the towns of Hirske and Zolote, which they claimed to have fully captured by the next day.[39][40] By 25 June, Russia captured Sievierodonetsk.[41] With Russia's breakthrough in the south and their victory in Sievierodonetsk, the attention of the Russian offensive shifted to Lysychansk.[citation needed] Battle[edit] After the fall of Sievierodonetsk, Lysychansk became the last major city in the Luhansk Oblast under Ukrainian control. Military units of the separatist Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) fought alongside Russian infantry and were supported by Russian artillery and airstrikes. The Rapid Response Brigade of the Ukrainian National Guard stressed that defensive positions in Lysychansk were more defensible than in Sievierodenetsk.[citation needed] The Russian offensive against Lysychansk was overseen and planned by Aleksandr Lapin, Commander of the Central Military District, and Sergey Surovikin, Commander of the Russian Aerospace Forces. The Institute for the Study of War argued that the involvement of these top-level commanders showcased the importance Russian put into the city's capture.[4] An initial Russian armored assault on Lysychansk was repelled by the pro-Ukrainian forces, with Belarusian volunteers under Ivan "Brest" Marchuk playing a major role in fighting off the tanks.[7] On 25 June, Russian and separatist units began entering Lysychansk from the south, reaching a mine and a gelatin factory on the outskirts of the city the same day. According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System also showed "heat anomalies" at the gelatin factory, corroborating reports of military activity there.[42] On 26 June, TASS reported that Russian and separatist forces commanded by Lapin and Esedulla Abachev[3] had entered the city from five directions and were isolating Ukrainian units, but this report could not be independently verified at the time. The Ukrainian general staff said intensive Russian airstrikes and artillery was aimed at cutting off Lysychansk from the south, but did not mention separatists entering the city. Civilian evacuations had been ordered, and one fleeing civilian interviewed in Pokrovsk called the situation in Lysychansk "a horror".[43][27] The Russian contingents also included Chechen Kadyrovites headed by Zamid Chalaev [ru][5] and Apti Alaudinov,[6] head of the Akhmat special forces.[44] Amid this Russian breakthrough, the Ukrainian defenders were forced into a disorganized retreat, resulting in many losses, including the death of Belarusian commander Marchuk.[8][7] On 27 June, CNN reported that civilians in Lysychans contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 54 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Battle_of_Lysychansk responseCode 3 200
