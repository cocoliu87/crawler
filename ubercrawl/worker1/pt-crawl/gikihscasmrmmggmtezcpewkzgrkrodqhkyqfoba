Open access logo, originally designed by Public Library of Science A PhD Comics introduction to open access Open access (OA) is a set of principles and a range of practices through which research outputs are distributed online, free of access charges or other barriers.[1] Under some models of open access publishing, barriers to copying or reuse are also reduced or removed by applying an open license for copyright.[1] The main focus of the open access movement is "peer reviewed research literature".[2] Historically, this has centered mainly on print-based academic journals. Whereas non-open access journals cover publishing costs through access tolls such as subscriptions, site licenses or pay-per-view charges, open-access journals are characterised by funding models which do not require the reader to pay to read the journal's contents, relying instead on author fees or on public funding, subsidies and sponsorships. Open access can be applied to all forms of published research output, including peer-reviewed and non peer-reviewed academic journal articles, conference papers, theses,[3] book chapters,[1] monographs,[4] research reports and images.[5] Since the revenue of most open access journals is earned from publication fees charged to the authors, OA publishers are motivated to increase their profits by accepting low-quality papers and by not performing thorough peer review.[6][7] On the other hand, the prices for OA publications in the most prestigious journals have exceeded US$5,000 per article, making such publishing model unaffordable to a large number of researchers. This increase in publishing cost has been called the "Open-Access Sequel to [the] Serials Crisis".[8] Definitions[edit] There are different models of open access publishing and publishers may use one or more of these models. Colour naming system[edit] Different open access types are currently commonly described using a colour system. The most commonly recognised names are "green", "gold", and "hybrid" open access; however, several other models and alternative terms are also used. Gold OA[edit] Number of Gold open access journals listed in the Directory of Open Access Journals[9][10] Number of Gold and Hybrid open access journals listed in PubMed Central[11][12] In the gold OA model, the publisher makes all articles and related content available for free immediately on the journal's website. In such publications, articles are licensed for sharing and reuse via Creative Commons licenses or similar.[1] Many gold OA publishers charge an article processing charge (APC), which is typically paid through institutional or grant funding. The majority of gold open access journals charging APCs follow an "author-pays" model,[13] although this is not an intrinsic property of gold OA.[14] Green OA[edit] Venn diagram highlighting the key features of different types of open access in scholarly publishing[15] Self-archiving by authors is permitted under green OA. Independently from publication by a publisher, the author also posts the work to a website controlled by the author, the research institution that funded or hosted the work, or to an independent central open repository, where people can download the work without paying.[16] Green OA is gratis for the author. Some publishers (less than 5% and decreasing as of 2014) may charge a fee for an additional service[16] such as a free license on the publisher-authored copyrightable portions of the printed version of an article. If the author posts the near-final version of their work after peer review by a journal, the archived version is called a "postprint". This can be the accepted manuscript as returned by the journal to the author after successful peer review. Hybrid OA[edit] Hybrid open-access journals contain a mixture of open access articles and closed access articles.[17][18] A publisher following this model is partially funded by subscriptions, and only provide open access for those individual articles for which the authors (or research sponsor) pay a publication fee.[19] Hybrid OA generally costs more than gold OA and can offer a lower quality of service.[20] A particularly controversial practice in hybrid open access journals is "double dipping", where both authors and subscribers are charged.[21] For these reasons, Hybrid Open Access journals have been called a "Mephistophelian invention",[22] and publishing in Hybrid OA journals is not considered as meeting the open access mandate.[23] Bronze OA[edit] Bronze open access articles are free to read only on the publisher page, but lack a clearly identifiable license.[24] Such articles are typically not available for reuse. Diamond/platinum OA[edit] See also: Diamond open access Journals that publish open access without charging authors article processing charges are sometimes referred to as diamond[25][26][27] or platinum[28][29] OA. Since they do not charge either readers or authors directly, such publishers often require funding from external sources such as the sale of advertisements, academic institutions, learned societies, philanthropists or government grants.[30][31][32] There are now over 350 platinum OA journals with impact factors over a wide variety of academic disciplines, giving most academics options for OA with no APCs.[33] Diamond OA journals are available for most disciplines, and are usually small (<25 articles per year) and more likely to be multilingual (38%); thousands of such journals exist.[27] Black OA[edit] See also: Shadow library Download rate for articles on Sci-Hub (black open access)[34] The growth of unauthorized digital copying by large-scale copyright infringement has enabled free access to paywalled literature.[35][36] This has been done via existing social media sites (e.g. the #ICanHazPDF hashtag) as well as dedicated sites (e.g. Sci-Hub).[35] In some ways this is a large-scale technical implementation of pre-existing practice, whereby those with access to paywalled literature would share copies with their contacts.[37][38][39][40] However, the increased ease and scale from 2010 onwards have changed how many people treat subscription publications.[41] Gratis and libre[edit] Main article: Gratis versus libre Similar to the free content definition, the terms 'gratis' and 'libre' were used in the Budapest Open Access Initiative definition to distinguish between free to read versus free to reuse.[42] Gratis open access () refers to free online access, to read, free of charge, without re-use rights.[42] Libre open access () also refers to free online access, to read, free of charge, plus some additional re-use rights,[42] covering the kinds of open access defined in the Budapest Open Access Initiative, the Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing and the Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities. The re-use rights of libre OA are often specified by various specific Creative Commons licenses;[43] all of which require as a minimum attribution of authorship to the original authors.[42][44] In 2012, the number of works under libre open access was considered to have been rapidly increasing for a few years, though most open-access mandates did not enforce any copyright license and it was difficult to publish libre gold OA in legacy journals.[2] However, there are no costs nor restrictions for green libre OA as preprints can be freely self-deposited with a free license, and most open-access repositories use Creative Commons licenses to allow reuse.[45] FAIR[edit] Main article: FAIR data FAIR is an acronym for 'findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable', intended to more clearly define what is meant by the term 'open access' and make the concept easier to discuss.[46][47] Initially proposed in March 2016, it has subsequently been endorsed by organisations such as the European Commission and the G20.[48][49] Features[edit] The emergence of open science or open research has brought to light a number of controversial and hotly-debated topics. Scholarly publishing invokes various positions and passions. For example, authors may spend hours struggling with diverse article submission systems, often converting document formatting between a multitude of journal and conference styles, and sometimes spend months waiting for peer review results. The drawn-out and often contentious societal and technological transition to Open Access and Open Science/Open Research, particularly across North America and Europe (Latin America has already widely adopted "Acceso Abierto" since before 2000[50]) has led to increasingly entrenched positions and much debate.[51] The area of (open) scholarly practices increasingly see a role for policy-makers and research funders[52][53][54] giving focus to issues such as career incentives, research evaluation and business models for publicly funded research. Plan S and AmeliCA[55] (Open Knowledge for Latin America) caused a wave of debate in scholarly communication in 2019 and 2020.[56][57] Licenses[edit] Licenses used by gold and hybrid OA journals in DOAJ[58] Subscription-based publishing typically requires transfer of copyright from authors to the publisher so that the latter can monetise the process via dissemination and reproduction of the work.[59][60][61][62] With OA publishing, typically authors retain copyright to their work, and license its reproduction to the publisher.[63] Retention of copyright by authors can support academic freedoms by enabling greater control of the work (e.g. for image re-use) or licensing agreements (e.g. to allow dissemination by others).[64] The most common licenses used in open access publishing are Creative Commons.[65] The widely used CC BY license is one of the most permissive, only requiring attribution to be allowed to use the material (and allowing derivations and commercial use).[66] A ran contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 53 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Open_access_journal responseCode 3 200
