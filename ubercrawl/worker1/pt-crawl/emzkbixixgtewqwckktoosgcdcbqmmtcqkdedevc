organisation of political parties which seek to establish democratic socialism.[1] It consists mostly of social-democratic, socialist and labour political parties and organisations. Although formed in 1951 as a successor to the Labour and Socialist International, it has antecedents in the late 19th century. The organisation currently includes 132 member parties[3] and organisations from over 100 countries. Its members have governed in many countries, including most of Europe. In 2013, a schism in the SI led to the establishment of the Progressive Alliance.[4] The current secretary general of the SI is Benedicta Lasi of Ghana and the current president of the SI is the prime minister of Spain, Pedro Sánchez,[5] both of whom were elected at the last SI Congress held in Madrid, Spain, in November 2022. History[edit] First and Second Internationals (1864–1916)[edit] The International Workingmen's Association, also known as the First International, was the first international body to bring together organisations representing the working class.[6] It was formed in London on 28 September 1864 by socialist, communist and anarchist political groups and trade unions.[7] Tensions between moderates and revolutionaries led to its dissolution in 1876 in Philadelphia.[8] The Second International was formed in Paris on 14 July 1889 as an association of the socialist parties.[9] Differences over World War I led to the Second International being dissolved in 1916. Labour and Socialist International (1919–1940)[edit] The International Socialist Commission (ISC), also known as the Berne International, was formed in February 1919 at a meeting in Bern by parties that wanted to resurrect the Second International.[10] In March 1919, Communist parties formed the Communist International ("Comintern"), the Third International, at a meeting in Moscow.[11] Some parties did not want to be a part of the resurrected Second International (ISC) or Comintern. They formed the International Working Union of Socialist Parties (IWUSP, also known as Vienna International, Vienna Union, or Two-and-a-Half International) on 27 February 1921 at a conference in Vienna.[12] The ISC and the IWUSP joined to form the Labour and Socialist International (LSI) in May 1923 at a meeting in Hamburg.[13] The rise of Nazism and the start of World War II led to the dissolution of the LSI in 1940. Socialist International (1951–present)[edit] The Socialist International was formed in Frankfurt in July 1951 as a successor to the LSI.[14] During the post-World War II period, the SI aided social democratic parties in re-establishing themselves when dictatorship gave way to democracy in Portugal (1974) and Spain (1975). Until its 1976 Geneva Congress, the SI had few members outside Europe and no formal involvement with Latin America.[15] In the 1980s, most SI parties gave their backing to the Nicaraguan Sandinistas (FSLN), whose democratically elected left-wing government was subject to a campaign to overthrow it backed by the United States, which culminated in the Iran–Contra affair after the Reagan administration covertly continued US support for the Contras after such support was banned by Congress. Willy Brandt with outgoing secretary general Bernt Carlsson (left) and new secretary general Pentti Väänänen (right) at the Socialist International Congress in 1983 In the late 1970s and in the 1980s the SI had extensive contacts and discussion with the two leading powers of the Cold War period, the United States and the Soviet Union, on issues concerning East–West relations and arms control. The SI supported détente and disarmament agreements, such as SALT II, START and INF. They had several meetings and discussion in Washington, D.C., with President Jimmy Carter and Vice President George Bush and in Moscow with Secretaries General Leonid Brezhnev and Mikhail Gorbachev. The SI's delegations to these discussions were led by the Finnish Prime Minister Kalevi Sorsa.[16] Since then, t contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 74 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/President_of_the_Socialist_International responseCode 3 200
