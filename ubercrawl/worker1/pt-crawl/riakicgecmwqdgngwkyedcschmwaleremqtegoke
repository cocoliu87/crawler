Dalrymple's interests include the history and art of India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, the Middle East, Hinduism, Buddhism, the Jains and early Eastern Christianity. Every one of his ten books has won literary prizes. His first three were travel books based on his journeys in the Middle East, India and Central Asia. His early influences included travel writers such as Robert Byron,[23] Eric Newby, and Bruce Chatwin. Dalrymple published a book of essays about current affairs in the Indian subcontinent, and four award-winning histories of the interaction between the East India Company and the peoples of India and Afghanistan between the eighteenth and mid-nineteenth century, his "Company Quartet". His books have been translated into more than 40 languages. He is a regular contributor to The New York Review of Books,[24] The Guardian,[25] the New Statesman[26] and The New Yorker.[27] He has also written many articles for Time magazine. He was the Indian Subcontinent correspondent of the New Statesman from 2004-2014. He attended the inaugural Palestine Festival of Literature in 2008, giving readings and taking workshops in Jerusalem, Ramallah and Bethlehem.[28] His 2009 book, Nine Lives: In Search of the Sacred in Modern India, a study of some of the more esoteric forms of modern Indian, and especially Hindu, spirituality, was published by Bloomsbury, and like all his others, went to the number one slot on the Indian non-fiction best-seller list.[29] After its publication he toured the UK, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Australia, Holland and the US with a band consisting of some of the people featured in his book including Sufis, Fakirs, Bauls, Tevaram hymn singers as well as a prison warder and part-time Theyyam dancer widely believed to incarnate the god Vishnu.[30] Return of a King: The Battle for Afghanistan, a history of the First Afghan War 1839–42, was published in India in December 2012,[8] in the UK in February 2013, and in the US in April 2013. Dalrymple's great-great-granduncle Colin Mackenzie fought in the war and was briefly detained by the Afghans. Following the publication of the book Dalrymple was called to brief both the Afghan President Hamid Karzai and the White House on the lessons to be learned from Afghan history.[citation needed] His most recent book, published in 2019, is The Anarchy, a history of the Indian Subcontinent during the period from 1739 to 1803, which saw the collapse of the Mughal imperial system,[31] rise of the Maratha imperial confederacy, and the militarisation and rise to power of the East India Company.[32] It was long listed for the Baillie Gifford Prize 2019, and short listed for the Duke of Wellington medal for Military History, the Tata Book of the Year (Non-fiction) and the Historical Writers Association Book Award 2020. It was a Finalist for the Cundill Prize for History and won the 2020 Arthur Ross Bronze Medal from the US Council on Foreign Relations.[33] As of 2020, he was writing a book that is "a sweeping look at India’s ideological colonisation of Asia, China and Europe during the short period between 250 BC to about 800 AD."[34] TV and radio[edit] Dalrymple has written and presented the six-part television series Stones of the Raj (Channel 4, August 1997),[35] the three-part Indian Journeys (BBC, August 2002)[36] and Sufi Soul (Channel 4, Nov 2005).[37] The six-part Stones of the Raj documents the stories behind some of British India's colonial architecture starting with Lahore (16 August 1997), Calcutta (23 August 1997), The French Connection (30 August 1997), The Fatal Friendship (6 September 1997), Surrey in Tibet (13 September 1997), and concluded with The Magnificent Ruin (20 September 1997). The trilogy of Indian Journeys consists of three one-hour episodes starting with Shiva’s Matted Locks which, while tracing the source of the Ganga, takes Dalrymple on a journey to the Himalayas; the second part, City of Djinns, is based on his travel book of the same name, and takes a look at Delhi's history; lastly, Doubting Thomas takes Dalrymple to the Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, with which St Thomas, the Apostle of Jesus is closely associated.[38] He has done a six-part history series The Long Search for Radio 4.[39] In this series Dalrymple searches to discover the spiritual roots of the British Isles. Dalrymple says "In the course of my travels I often came across the assumption that intense spirituality was somehow the preserve of what many call 'the mystic East'... it's a misconception that has always irritated me as I've always regarded our own indigenous British traditions of spirituality as especially rich." The BBC broadcast a documentary on 3 September 2015 entitled Love and Betrayal in India: The White Mughal,[40] based on Dalrymple's book White Mughals. Dalrymple was the historical consultant to ITV's 2019 series Beecham House.[41][42] In 2022, Dalrymple teamed up with journalist Anita Anand to create the podcast Empire, the first series of which examines the British East India Company and British involvement and influence on India.[43] The pair had previously collaborated on the book Koh-i-Noor: The History of the World's Most Infamous Diamond. The Podcast went straight to No.1 in the UK Apple Podcast charts, had over five million downloads in its first six months and was nominated for UK Podcast of the Year in the Broadcasting Press Guild Audio Awards.[44] Bibliography[edit] This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items.
