The zone became active about 2.7 million years ago, with long periods of eruptive activity interspersed with quiescence. Its last eruptions took place about 57,000 years ago; individual volcanic vents are considered extinct, but the field itself is not. The volcanic field covers an area of about 1,500 square miles (3,900 km2) and has a total volume of 2.4 cubic miles (10 km3). The highest elevation of the field is at Larch Mountain, which reaches a height of 4,055 feet (1,236 m). The Portland metropolitan area, including suburbs, is one of the few places in the continental United States to have extinct volcanoes within a city's limits. The probability of future eruptions affecting the Portland metropolitan area is very low. (Full article...)

Its three subspecies are resident in much of sub-Saharan Africa in open habitats with trees. It is a slim bird about 19 cm (7.5 in) in length, with a fine bill, long tail and cryptic grey and brown plumage. The sexes look similar. The diet is almost entirely ants. This wryneck's call is a series of shrill notes. When threatened, it will hiss and twist its neck and head in a snake-like manner to deter predators. It nests in pre-existing holes, usually in trees, preferring old barbet or woodpecker nests. The nest cavity is unlined, and the clutch is typically three or four white eggs. Both sexes incubate for 12 to 15 days until the blind, naked chicks hatch. The chicks are fed by both adults for 25 to 26 days until they fledge. There are usually two broods. This bird has a very extensive range, and a large and increasing population. It is evaluated as a species of least concern by the IUCN. (Full article...)

The home of the Frisco RoughRiders, a Double-A team of the Texas League, it opened on April 3, 2003, and can seat 10,216 people. Primarily a venue for Minor League Baseball games, the facility also hosts high school and college baseball tournaments and other public and private events. It has been the site of three Texas League All-Star Games. In his design, park architect David M. Schwarz desired the creation of a village-like "park within a (ball)park". The stadium received the 2003 Texas Construction award for Best Architectural Design. Attendance for RoughRiders games at the stadium has consistently placed first or second in the Texas League and at the Double-A classification since its opening. After having the second-highest attendance in its first two seasons, it had the highest in the league and classification from 2005 to 2019. (Full article...)

She wrote the song with its producer Kevin Kadish. Epic Records released it as Title's second single on October 21, 2014. A doo-wop and pop song, it was inspired by Trainor's conflict with her label, but critics interpreted it as a song about leaving a cheating significant other. Some compared it to "All About That Bass" (2014); some found it catchy while others criticized its lyrics. Peaking at number four on the Billboard Hot 100, it was certified 4× Platinum in the United States. It reached the top ten in countries including Australia and Canada, where it received multi-platinum certifications. Philip Andelman directed its music video, said to be the first created entirely by social media influencers, portraying behind-the-scenes events of a video shoot. Trainor performed the song on television shows and her concert tours. (This article is part of a featured topic: Title (album).)

Young (1803–1857) was an American educator and pastor who was the fourth president of Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. He entered the ministry in Lexington, Kentucky, in 1828. He accepted the presidency of Centre College in 1830, holding the position until his death in 1857, making him the longest-serving president in the college's history. During his term, he increased the endowment of the college more than fivefold and increased the graduating class size from two students in his first year to forty-seven in his final year. Continuing to preach while in office, Young accepted the pastorate of the Danville Presbyterian Church in 1834, and founded the Second Presbyterian Church in Danville in 1852. He was elected moderator of the Presbyterian Church's General Assembly in 1853. Young is the eponym of several facets of the college today, including Young Hall. He was the father of William C. Young, who later became Centre's eighth president. (Full article...)

Held annually, the Boat Race is a side-by-side rowing race between crews from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge along a 4.2-mile (6.8 km) tidal stretch of the River Thames in south-west London. The lead changed twice during the race, which Oxford won by one foot (30 cm), the smallest margin of victory in the history of the event. The close race has been described as "epic". Five-time Olympic gold medallist Steve Redgrave suggested that the race was the "greatest we will see in any of our lifetimes". Umpired by the Boat Race veteran Boris Rankov, the 2003 race was the first to be scheduled on a Sunday. As a result of a collision between the Cambridge boat and a launch, a member of the Cambridge crew was replaced just two days before the race. This was the first Boat Race to feature two sets of brothers on opposing sides. In the reserve race Cambridge's Goldie beat Oxford's Isis and Oxford won the women's race. (Full article...)

There are two extant species: the North American (pictured) and Eurasian beaver. Both have stout bodies, large heads, chisel-like incisors, hand-like front feet, webbed back feet and flat, scaly tails. The Eurasian beaver has a longer skull, lighter color and narrower tail. Both are found in freshwater habitats, and are herbivorous, consuming plants and tree bark. They build dams and lodges using tree branches, vegetation, rocks and mud. Their infrastructure has a great impact on the surrounding environment. Adults live in monogamous pairs with their offspring. Beavers are territorial and scent-mark with a secretion called castoreum. Historically, beavers were hunted for their fur, meat and castoreum. Overhunting nearly exterminated both species. With protection, populations have rebounded, and both are listed as least-concern species on the IUCN Red List. The beaver symbolizes industriousness and is Canada's national animal.
