The Houthi movement is a predominately Zaidi Shia force,[7] whose leadership is drawn largely from the Houthi tribe.[78] Under the leadership of Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, the group emerged as an opposition to former Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh. They accused him of corruption and criticized him for being backed by Saudi Arabia and the United States.[59] Hussein accused Saleh of seeking to please the U.S. at the expense of the Yemeni people[79] and Yemen's sovereignty.[80] In 2003, the Houthis' slogan, "God is great, death to the US, death to Israel, curse the Jews, and victory for Islam", became the group's trademark.[81] Resisting Saleh's order for his arrest,[82] Hussein was killed in Sa'dah in 2004 along with a number of his guards by the Yemeni army, sparking the Houthi insurgency in Yemen.[83] Since then, except for a short intervening period, the movement has been led by his brother Abdul-Malik al-Houthi.[82] The Houthi movement attracts followers in Yemen by portraying themselves as fighting for economic development, the end of political marginalization of Zaidi Shia Muslims,[84] and promoting regional political-religious issues in its media, fostering the rhetoric of an overarching U.S.–Israeli conspiracy theory and Arab "collusion".[85][81] The Houthis have a complex relationship with Yemen's Sunni Muslims; the movement has discriminated against Sunnis, but also recruited and allied with them.[86][8][87][9] The Houthis took part in the 2011 Yemeni Revolution by participating in street protests and by coordinating with other opposition groups. They joined the National Dialogue Conference in Yemen as part of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) initiative to broker peace following the unrest. However, the Houthis would later reject the November 2011 GCC deal's provisions stipulating formation of six federal regions in Yemen, claiming that the deal did not fundamentally reform governance and that the proposed federalization "divided Yemen into poor and wealthy regions". Houthis also feared the deal was a blatant attempt to weaken them by dividing areas under their control between separate regions.[9][84] In late 2014, Houthis repaired their relationship with the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, and with his help, they took control of the capital and much of the north, and announced the fall of the government of Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi.[88][89][90] Since 2015, the Houthis have been fighting the Saudi Arabian–led intervention in Yemen that seeks to establish full territorial control by the internationally recognized government within Yemen.[91] Additionally, the Islamic State militant group has attacked all of the major parties to the conflict, including the Houthis, forces loyal to former president Saleh, the Yemeni government, and the Saudi Arabian–led coalition forces.[92][93] The Houthis aim to govern all of Yemen, and external anti-imperialist movements against the United States, Israel, and Saudi Arabia.[94] They have launched repeated missile and drone attacks against Saudi cities. The conflict is widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.[95] In 2023, the movement began to launch missiles at Israeli cities,[96][97][98] and in the process reportedly became involved in the first instance of space warfare in human history.[99][100][101] History See also: History of Yemen, Houthi insurgency in Yemen, and Houthi takeover in Yemen Current (October 2022) political and military control in ongoing Yemeni Civil War (2014–present) Controlled by the Government of Yemen (under the Presidential Leadership Council since April 2022) and allies Controlled by Houthis-led Supreme Political Council Controlled by Al-Qaeda (AQAP) and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant-affiliated Ansar al-Sharia Controlled by the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council According to Ahmed Addaghashi, a professor at Sanaa University, the Houthis began as a moderate theological movement that preached tolerance and held a broad-minded view of all the Yemeni peoples.[102] Their first organization, "the Believing Youth" (BY), was founded in 1992 in Saada Governorate[103]: 1008  by either Mohammed al-Houthi,[104]: 98  or his brother Hussein al-Houthi.[105] The Believing Youth established school clubs and summer camps[104]: 98  in order to "promote a Zaidi revival" in Saada.[105] By 1994–1995, 15–20,000 students had attended BY summer camps. The religious material included lectures by Mohammed Hussein Fadhlallah (a Lebanese shia scholar) and Hassan Nasrallah (Secretary General of Lebanon's Hezbollah Party)."[104]: 99 [106] The formation of the Houthi organisations has been described by Adam Baron of the European Council on Foreign Relations as a reaction to foreign intervention. Their views include shoring up Zaydi support against the perceived threat of Saudi-influenced ideologies in Yemen and a general condemnation of the former Yemeni government's alliance with the United States, which, along with complaints regarding the government's corruption and the marginalisation of much of the Houthis' home areas in Saada, constituted the group's key grievances.[107] Although Hussein al-Houthi, who was killed in 2004, had no official relation with Believing Youth, according to Zaid, he contributed to the radicalisation of some Zaydis after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. BY-affiliated youth adopted anti-American and anti-Jewish slogans, which they chanted in the Saleh Mosque in Sanaa after Friday prayers. According to Zaid, the followers of Houthi's insistence on chanting the slogans attracted the authorities' attention, further increasing government worries over the extent of the Houthi movement's influence. "The security authorities thought that if today the Houthis chanted 'Death to America', tomorrow they could be chanting 'Death to the president [of Yemen]". 800 BY supporters were arrested in Sanaa in 2004. President Ali Abdullah Saleh then invited Hussein al-Houthi to a meeting in Sanaa, but Hussein declined. On 18 June 2004 Saleh sent government forces to arrest Hussein.[82] Hussein responded by launching an insurgency against the central government, but was killed on 10 September 2004.[79] The insurgency continued intermittently until a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2010.[102] During this prolonged conflict, the Yemeni army and air force was used to suppress the Houthi rebellion in northern Yemen. The Saudis joined these anti-Houthi campaigns, but the Houthis won against both Saleh and the Saudi army. According to the Brookings Institution, this particularly humiliated the Saudis, who spent tens of billions of dollars on their military.[59] Later, the Houthis participated in the 2011 Yemeni Revolution, as well as the ensuing National Dialogue Conference (NDC).[108] However, they rejected the provisions of the November 2011 Gulf Cooperation Council deal on the ground that "it divide[d] Yemen into poor and wealthy regions" and also in response to assassination of their repr contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 49 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Houthi_movement responseCode 3 200
