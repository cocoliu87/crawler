Therefore, we need to separate them. So those who want to save their life, please go south."[4] Israel initially demanded 1.1 million residents to evacuate within 24 hours,[5] which was condemned by the UN as "impossible without devastating humanitarian consequences."[6][7][8] The UN said the order created "chaos".[9] The order came one week after a surprise offensive on Israel from Gaza was mounted by Hamas. Israel's ground invasion of Gaza began on 27 October. As of November 4, 2023[update], between 800,000 and 1,000,000 people moved to the south of the Gaza Strip, while 350,000 to 400,000 remained in the north.[10] Hamas instructed civilians not to evacuate, and there are multiple reports indicating that Hamas physically hindered Gazans from fleeing to the south.[11][12][13][14][15] Multiple reports also indicated Israel targeted Palestinians during the evacuation process and subjected them to attacks and bombardments in the southern Gaza Strip.[16][17][18][19][20] Due to the hostilities, approximately 200,000 to 500,000 Israeli citizens have also been evacuated from communities in the vicinity of the border.[21] Paula Gaviria Betancur, UN special rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons, condemned the forcible evacuation order as a crime against humanity and violation of international humanitarian law.[22] The displacement resulting from the evacuation was part of a broader humanitarian crisis in Gaza.[23] Palestinians have described the evacuation of northern Gaza as the "second Nakba."[24] Background Tensions escalated when Hamas launched an offensive on Israel. Israel responded with a series of airstrike attacks on Gaza. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) issued a warning to residents in the northern regions to evacuate. The United Nations initially considered this evacuation order impractical to execute safely due to the significant number of people it affected.[25] An estimated 200,000 to 500,000 Israelis have also evacuated or fled their homes near the Gaza border and the border with Lebanon due to the hostilities. The IDF formally evacuated all residents within 7km of Gaza and ordered the evacuation of communities within 4km of the Lebanese border.[21] Evacuation In the first two days following the announcement of the evacuation order, hundreds of thousands fled to southern Gaza.[26] Israel initially provided a six-hour window for individuals to flee south.[27] Israel exerted force on residents to flee south. On 4 November, Israel bombed the Jabalia refugee camp, leading Al Jazeera to remark Israel was "trying to eliminate all sources of survival for the civilian population to force the evacuation to the southern part of Gaza."[28] By 10 November, estimates of the number of people remaining in northern Gaza ranged from the low hundreds of thousands to at least 900,000.[29] Those who remained had little to no access to water, food, or electricity.[29] UNICEF noted thousands of children remained in northern Gaza, whose lives were "hanging on by a thread."[30] On 17 November, the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics estimated there were still some 800,000 civilians in northern Gaza.[31] On 8 November, an estimated 50,000 people evacuated northern Gaza.[32] Civilians fled northern Gaza on foot or on donkey carts.[33] As they passed Israeli tanks, civilians waved white flags, though some reported Israeli soldiers firing at them and passing dead bodies along the road.[33] Many fled on an evacuation corridor along Salah al-Din Road, one of Gaza's two north-south highways.[34] On 10 November, an Israeli spokesman stated 100,000 people had fled northern Gaza in the prior two days.[35] Evacuees reported having to pass through Israeli checkpoints, where IDF soldiers made arrests.[36] On 12 November, Israel announced a temporary four-hour "temporary tactical cessation of military activities" at the Jabalia refugee camp to allow for residents to evacuate south.[37] A Palestinian journalist noted the humanitarian pauses only extended to Salah al-Din Street, but not to any of the roads leading to it.[38] On 12 November, CARE International noted, "The journey to the south is incredibly dangerous and hard. Many of those who have made it out have experienced and witnessed terrible suffering."[39] The same day, the International Committee of the Red Cross released a statement, noting it was "gravely concerned by the precarious and unsafe conditions under which civilians are evacuating."[40] In an article in The Intercept, Gazan journalist Hind Khoudary compared the evacuation to the Trail of Tears, writing, "We kept walking. As we walked, pushing each other, we saw bombed cars and dead bodies inside the cars. Flies filled the cars, feasting on the blood and the bodies inside."[41] On 15 November, OCHA stated Israel was arresting evacuees, reportedly beating and stripping people naked.[42] The Palestinian Red Crescent documented evacuees, including children and wounded on stretchers, walking 11km (6.8-mile) from Gaza City to southern Gaza.[43] Journalists covering the evacuation on Salah al-Din road stated men were being denied access past an Israeli checkpoint into southern Gaza.[44] Doctors Without Borders condemned a deliberate Israeli attack on a medical convoy evacuating northern Gaza.[45] Evacuees described the evacuation path as full of death and horror.[46] Hospitals On 14 October 2023, Israel ordered the evacuation of 22 hospitals in northern Gaza. The WHO described the order as a "death sentence" for the sick and wounded.[47] Doctors Without Borders issued a statement calling the order "outrageous," "an attack on medical care and on humanity," and condemned it "in the strongest possible terms."[48] The World Health Organisation released a plea requesting Israel to rescind the orders, noting the extreme difficultly moving patients in critical care, the depletion of medical supplies, and that "the four Ministry of Health hospitals in south Gaza are already beyond capacity".[49] Similar statements were issued by UNICEF and IRC.[50][51] The WHO expressed concern about the evacuation order sent to the al-Quds Hospital in Gaza.[52] On 29 October 2023, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization, described reports from the Palestinian Red Crescent that the al-Quds hospital had received an urgent evacuation warning and notice that it was "going to be bombarded" as "deeply concerning." He reiterated that it was "impossible to evacuate hospitals full of patients without endangering their lives."[53] Doctors across northern Gaza stated they were unable to follow Israel's evacuation order, since their patients, including newborns in the ICU, would die.[54] On Monday 16 October, Israel ordered the al-Ahli Arab Hospital, and the rest of northern Gaza, to evacuate.[55] Because of insufficient beds in the southern Gaza Strip and no means of transporting patients, such as newborns in incubators or patients on ventilators, the evacuation orders were widely regarded as impossible to comply with.[55] On 17 October, a widely condemned explosion in the al-Ahli courtyard resulted in significant fatalities.[56] On 10 November, Muhammad Abu Salmiya, the director of Al Shifa hospital, noted that despite Israeli bombings, medical staff would stay with patients until the "last moment."[57] Abu Salmiya stated, "There is a war against hospitals… this has never happened in any war."[57] On 12 November, the IDF announced that it was enabling a safe passage from Al-Shifa, Rantisi, and Nasser hospitals, and opened and secured an additional one to help people to evacuate to the south.[58] On 13 November, however, the Gaza Health Ministry stated thousands of patients were unable to evacuate, after Israel’s military encircled health facilities.[59] On 14 November, Human Rights Watch noted the impossibility of evacuation from al-Shifa Hospital, stating , "There is no reliably safe route to evacuate. Satellite imagery confirms fires, military operations, and roadblocks on every conceivable route. And many sick and injured people in the hospital wouldn’t be able to evacuate even if the roads were clear."[60] Attacks on evacuees Further information: 2023 attacks on Palestinians evacuating Gaza City Both Hamas and the IDF accused contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 71 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Evacuation_of_the_northern_Gaza_Strip responseCode 3 200
