Australia defeated Sri Lanka by 53 runs (under the Duckworth–Lewis method) to win their 4th World Cup and 3rd in succession. Road to the final[edit] Australia reached the final by defeating South Africa by 7 wickets, while Sri Lanka reached the final by defeating New Zealand by 81 runs in the semi-finals. Details[edit] This was the first World Cup final to be a repeat – the sides previously met in the 1996 World Cup Final, which Sri Lanka won. Australia has won every World Cup match against Sri Lanka apart from that loss.[1] The match was Sri Lanka's second World Cup final appearance and Australia's sixth, their fourth in a row. Ricky Ponting won the toss and elected to bat. However, the start of play was delayed due to rain, and the match was reduced to 38 overs per side. Adam Gilchrist's score of 149 – the highest in a World Cup final – helped give Australia an imposing total of 281.[2] A large crowd of over 10,000 fans welcome the Australian team on completing the first World Cup hat-trick – Martin Place, Sydney. Sri Lankan batsmen Kumar Sangakkara and Sanath Jayasuriya added 116 for the second wicket, before falling with the score at 123 and 145 respectively.[2] Despite the regular loss of wickets, Sri Lanka managed to maintain a run rate of over 6 an over. Further rain forced the reduction of Sri Lanka's innings to just 36 overs, with the target revised to 269. At the culmination of the 33rd over, with Sri Lanka still trailing the adjusted Duckworth-Lewis target by 37 runs, the umpires suspended the game due to bad light. While Australia's players began to celebrate their victory (since the minimum 20 overs had been reached), the umpires incorrectly announced that because the match was suspended due to light and not rain, the final three overs would have to be bowled the following day. With Sri Lanka needing 61 runs from 18 deliveries, Jayawardene agreed there was no need to return the following day, and instructed his team to resume batting, with Ponting agreeing to bowl only spinners. The last three overs were played in almost complete darkness, during which Sri Lanka added nine runs, giving Australia a 53-run victory via the Duckworth–Lewis method.[3] The umpires later apologised for their error, and stated that the match should have ended then with Australia winning by 37 runs.[4] Australian captain Ricky Ponting Australia won the tournament undefeated, and established a streak of 29 World Cup games without a loss.[5] Australian bowler Glenn McGrath was named Player of the Series.[6] Scorecard[edit] 1st innings Australia batting[7] Player Status Runs Balls 4s 6s Strike rate Adam Gilchrist c Silva b Fernando 149 104 13 8 143.26 Matthew Hayden c Jayawardene b Malinga 38 55 3 1 69.09 Ricky Ponting run out (Jayawardene) 37 42 1 1 88.09 Andrew Symonds not out 23 21 2 0 109.52 Shane Watson b Malinga 3 3 0 0 100.00 Michael Clarke not out 8 6 1 0 133.33 Mike Hussey Brad Hogg Nathan Bracken Shaun Tait Glenn McGrath Extras (lb 4, w 16, nb 3) 23 Total (4 wickets; 38 overs) 281 Fall of wickets: 1–172 (Hayden, 22.5 ov), 2–224 (Gilchrist, 30.3 ov), 3–261 (Ponting, 35.4 ov), 4–266 (Watson, 36.2 ov) Sri Lanka bowling[7] Bowler Overs Maidens Runs Wickets Econ Wides NBs Chaminda Vaas 8 0 54 0 6.75 1 2 Lasith Malinga 8 1 49 2 6.12 0 0 Dilhara Fernando 8 0 74 1 9.25 4 1 Muttiah Muralitharan 7 0 44 0 6.28 2 0 Tillakaratne Dilshan 2 0 23 0 11.50 1 0 Sanath Jayasuriya 5 0 33 0 6.60 0 0 2nd innings Sri Lanka batting[7] Player Status Runs Balls 4s 6s Strike rate Upul Tharanga c Gilchrist b Bracken 6 8 1 0 75.00 Sanath Jayasuriya b Clarke 63 67 9 0 94.02 Kumar Sangakkara c Ponting b Hogg 54 52 6 1 103.84 Mahela Jayawardene lbw b Watson 19 19 1 0 100.00 Chamara Silva b Clarke 21 22 1 1 95.45 Tillakaratne Dilshan run out (Clarke/McGrath) 14 13 2 0 107.69 Russel Arnold c Gilchrist b McGrath 1 2 0 0 50.00 Chaminda Vaas not out 11 21 0 0 52.38 Lasith Malinga st Gilchrist b Symonds 10 6 0 1 166.66 Dilhara Fernando not out 1 6 0 0 16.66 Muttiah Muralitharan Extras (lb 1, w 14) 15 Total (8 wickets; 36 overs) 215 Fall of wickets: 1–7 (Tharanga, 2.1 ov), 2–123 (Sangakkara, 19.5 ov), 3–145 (Jayasuriya, 22.6 ov), 4–156 (Jayawardene, 25.5 ov), 5–188 (Dilshan, 29.6 ov), 6–190 (Silva, 30.1 ov), 7–194 (Arnold, 31.5 ov), 8–211 (Malinga, 33.6 ov) Australia bowling[7] Bowler Overs Maidens Runs Wickets Econ Wides NBs Nathan Bracken 6 1 34 1 5.66 1 0 Shaun Tait 6 0 42 0 7.00 2 0 Glenn McGrath 7 0 31 1 4.42 1 0 Shane Watson 7 0 49 1 7.00 3 0 Brad Hogg 3 0 19 1 6.33 0 0 Michael Clarke 5 0 33 2 6.60 2 0 Andrew Symonds 2 0 6 1 3.00 0 0 External links[edit] 2007 Cricket World Cup website ICC Overview of 2007 World Cup ICC website – Cricket World Cup page Cricinfo – Cricket World Cup 2007 References[edit] ^ "Australia v Sri Lanka: World Cup Series Summary".
