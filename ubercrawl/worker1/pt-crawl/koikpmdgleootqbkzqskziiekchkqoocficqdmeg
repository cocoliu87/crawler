The HTML entity is &Otilde; for √ï and &otilde; for √µ. Romagnol[edit] For Romagnol language, √µ is used in some proposed orthographies to represent [√µÀê], e.g. sav√µ [saÀàv√µÀê] "soap". To this day a unified standardization has not been established. Estonian[edit] In Estonian, √ï is the 27th letter of the alphabet (between W and √Ñ), and it represents a vowel characteristic of Estonian, the unrounded back vowel /…§/, which may be close-mid back, close back, or close-mid central.[1] The vowel was previously written with the letter √ñ, but in the early 19th century, Otto Wilhelm Masing adopted the letter √ï, ending the confusion between several homographs and clearly showing how to pronounce a word. In informal writing, e.g., emails, instant messaging and when using foreign keyboard layouts where the letter √ï is not available, some Estonians use the characters O or 6 to approximate this letter. In most parts of the island Saaremaa, √ï is pronounced the same as √ñ. Guarani[edit] In the Guarani language, √ï is the 22nd letter and fourth nasal vowel of the alphabet, similar to the Spanish "o", but with a stressed nasalization. Hungarian[edit] In Hungarian, √ï only appears when a typeface (font set) does not contain a proper ≈ë letter, which is an o with a double acute diacritic. The letter √ï is not part of the Hungarian alphabet, it is an error of improper computer font sets. Samogitian[edit] In Samogitian the letter √ï represents, as in Estonian, the unrounded back vowel /…§/ which is unique to Samogitian and is not found in Standard Lithuanian, this is a rather new innovation brought on by the ensuing efforts of standardising Samogitian, this letter alleviates the confusion between the two distinct pronunciations of the letter ƒó. Portuguese[edit] In the Portuguese language, the symbol √ï stands for a nasal close-mid back rounded vowel, also written [√µ] in IPA. It is not considered an independent letter of the alphabet: the tilde is the standard diacritic for nasalization. Vietnamese[edit] In the Vietnamese language, the symbol √ï stands for the sound […î] with creaky voice (rising tone with a glottal break followed by a continuation of the rising tone). Vietnamese also has derived letters ·ªñ/·ªó and ·ª†/·ª°. V√µro[edit] In the V√µro language, this letter is the 25th letter of the alphabet, pronounced as in Estonian.[2] Skolt Sami[edit] In the Skolt Sami language, this letter is the 25th letter of the alphabet, pronounced as […ò]. Voko[edit] In the Voko language, the letter √ï represents '…îÃÄ≈ã'. Mathematical use[edit] The symbol, pronounced soft-O, is used as a variant of big O notation to measure growth rate that ignores logarithmic factors.[3] Thus, f ( n ) ‚àà O ~ ( g ( n ) ) {\displaystyle f(n)\in {\tilde {O}}(g(n))} is shorthand for ‚àÉ k : f ( n ) ‚àà O ( g ( n ) log k ‚Å° n ) {\displaystyle \exists k:f(n)\in O(g(n)\log ^{k}n)} .[3] Computer encoding[edit] Due to character encoding confusion, the letters can be seen on many incorrectly coded Hungarian web pages, representing ≈ê/≈ë (letter O with double acute accent). This can happen due to said characters sharing a code point in the ISO 8859-1 and 8859-2 character sets, as well as the Windows-1252 and Windows-1250 character sets, and the web site designer forgetting to set the correct code page. √ï is not part of the Hungarian alphabet. The usage of Unicode avoids this type of problems. In Latex the option of using "\~o" and "\~O" exists.
