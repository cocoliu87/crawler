Shortcuts H:WT H:MARKUP H:WIKICODE Wikitext Cheatsheet All wikitext Sound files Visual files Tables Templates (quick guide) Using HTML codes within wikitext Pipe trick v t e The markup language called wikitext, also known as wiki markup or wikicode, consists of the syntax and keywords used by the MediaWiki software to format a page. (Note the lowercase spelling of these terms.)[a] To learn how to see this hypertext markup, and to save an edit, see Help:Editing. Generally, coding can be copied and pasted, without writing new code. There is a short list of markup and tips at Help:Cheatsheet. In addition to wikitext, some HTML elements are also allowed for presentation formatting. See Help:HTML in wikitext for information on this. Layout Sections Article sections in a page will follow that page's lead or introduction and, if there are four or more, the table of contents. Section headings Further information: Help:Section and Wikipedia:Manual of Style § Section headings The = through ====== markup are headings for the sections with which they are associated. A single = is styled as the article title and should not be used within an article. Headings are styled through CSS and add an [edit] link. See this section for the relevant CSS. Four or more headings cause a table of contents to be generated automatically. Do not use any markup after the final heading markup – this will either break the heading, or will cause the heading to not be included in an edit summary. Markup Renders as = Heading 1 =
== Heading 2 ==
=== Heading 3 ===
==== Heading 4 ====
===== Heading 5 =====
====== Heading 6 ======
 Heading 1 Heading 2 Heading 3 Heading 4 Heading 5 Heading 6 Templates: {{fake heading}} for use in documentation. Horizontal rule Further information: WP:LINE The horizontal rule represents a paragraph-level thematic break. Do not use in article content, as rules are used only after main sections, and this is automatic. Markup Renders as ---- HTML equivalent: <hr /> (which can be indented, whereas ---- always starts at the left margin.) Table of contents Further information: WP:TOC When a page has at least four headings, a table of contents (TOC) will automatically appear after the lead and before the first heading. The TOC can be controlled by magic words or templates: __FORCETOC__ forces the TOC to appear at the normal location regardless of the number of headings. __TOC__ forces the TOC to appear at the point where the magic word is inserted instead of the normal location. __NOTOC__ disables the TOC entirely. {{TOC limit}} template can be used to control the depth of subsections included in the TOC. This is useful where the TOC is long and unwieldy. Category:Wikipedia table of contents templates contains a number of specialized TOC templates. Line breaks Further information: Help:Line-break handling, Wikipedia:Line breaks usage, and Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility § Indentation Line breaks or newlines are used to add whitespace between lines, such as separating paragraphs. A line break that is visible in the content is inserted by pressing ↵ Enter twice. It's good practice to do this by itself when publishing changes. Leave additional changes to another edit because otherwise only the line break will be highlighted in the diff. Pressing ↵ Enter once will place a line break in the markup, but it will not show in the rendered content, except when using list markup. Markup such as bold or italics will be terminated at a line break. Blank lines within indented wikitext should not be added due to accessibility issues. Markup Renders as A single newline here
has no effect on the layout.

But an empty line starts a new paragraph, 
or ends a list or an indented part.
 A single newline here has no effect on the layout. But an empty line starts a new paragraph, or ends a list or an indented part. HTML equivalent: <br> or <br /> can be used to break line layout. Templates for line breaks: {{break}} can add multiple line breaks. {{-}} and {{clear}} adds a break with styling, to clear floating elements. Often used to prevent text from flowing next to unrelated tables or images. Unbulleted list: {{plainlist}} and {{unbulleted list}} both create an unbulleted list. Indent text Further information: WP:INDENT and Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility § Indentation Indentation is most commonly used on talk pages. Markup Renders as Indentation as used on talk pages:
:Each colon at the start of a line
::causes the line to be indented by three more character positions.
:::(The indentation persists
so long as no carriage return or line break is used.)
:::Repeat the indentation at any line break.
::::Use an extra colon for each response.
:::::And so forth ...
::::::And so on ...
{{Outdent|::::::}}The outdent template can give a visual indicator that we're deliberately cancelling the indent (6 levels here)

This is useful for (as the name says) inserting blocks of quoted (and cited) text. Markup Renders as Normal text
<blockquote>
The '''blockquote''' tag will indent both margins when needed instead of the left margin only as the colon does.
</blockquote>
Normal text
 Normal text The blockquote tag will indent both margins when needed instead of the left margin only as the colon does. Normal text This uses an HTML tag; template {{quote}} results in the same render. Center text See also: Span and div, HTML tag, and Template:Align Markup Renders as <div class="center" style="width: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">Centered text</div> Centered text Template {{center}} uses the same markup. To center a table, see Help:Table#Centering tables. Please do not use <center>...</center> tags, as it is obsolete. Align text to right You can align content in a separate container: Markup Renders as <div style="text-align: right; direction: ltr; margin-left: 1em;">Text on the right</div> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Text on the right Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Or; make the text float around it: Markup Renders as <div class="floatright">Text on the right</div> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Text on the right Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. {{stack|Text on the right}} Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Text on the right Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Lists Further information: Help:List and MOS:LIST Do not leave blank lines between items in a list unless there is a reason to do so, since this causes the MediaWiki software to interpret each item as beginning a new list.

Then, type a colon (:) followed by a definition. The format can also be used for other purposes, such as make and models of vehicles, etc. Description lists (formerly definition lists, and a.k.a. association lists) consist of group names corresponding to values. Group names (terms) are in bold. Values (definitions) are indented. Each group must include one or more definitions. For a single or first value, the : can be placed on the same line after ; – but subsequent values must be placed on separate lines. Do not use a semicolon (;) simply to bold a line without defining a value using a colon (:).
