The novel virus was first identified in an outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. Attempts to contain it there failed, allowing the virus to spread to other areas of Asia and then worldwide in early 2020. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020. The WHO ended its PHEIC declaration on 5 May 2023. As of 19 November 2023, the pandemic had caused 771,820,173[3] cases and 6,978,162[3] confirmed deaths, ranking it fifth in the deadliest epidemics and pandemics in history. COVID-19 symptoms range from asymptomatic to deadly, but most commonly include fever, sore throat, nocturnal cough, and fatigue. Transmission of the virus is often through airborne particles. Mutations have produced many strains (variants) with varying degrees of infectivity and virulence.[6] COVID-19 vaccines were widely deployed in various countries beginning in December 2020. Treatments include novel antiviral drugs and symptom control. Common mitigation measures during the public health emergency included travel restrictions, lockdowns, business restrictions and closures, workplace hazard controls, mask mandates, quarantines, testing systems, and contact tracing of the infected. The pandemic caused severe social and economic disruption around the world, including the largest global recession since the Great Depression.[7] Widespread supply shortages, including food shortages, were caused by supply chain disruptions and panic buying. Reduced human activity led to an unprecedented decrease in pollution. Educational institutions and public areas were partially or fully closed in many jurisdictions, and events were cancelled or postponed during 2020 and 2021. Many white-collar workers began working from home. Misinformation circulated through social media and mass media, and political tensions intensified. The pandemic raised issues of racial and geographic discrimination, health equity, and the balance between public health imperatives and individual rights. Terminology Further information: COVID-19 naming Chinese medics in Huanggang, Hubei, in 2020 In epidemiology, a pandemic is defined as "an epidemic occurring over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries, and usually affecting a large number of people". During the COVID-19 pandemic, as with other pandemics, the meaning of this term has been challenged.[8] During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus", "Wuhan coronavirus",[9] "the coronavirus outbreak" and the "Wuhan coronavirus outbreak",[10] with the disease sometimes called "Wuhan pneumonia".[11][12] In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCoV[13] and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease[14] as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 international guidelines against using geographical locations (e.g. Wuhan, China), animal species, or groups of people in disease and virus names in part to prevent social stigma.[15] WHO finalized the official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020.[16] Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained: CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified (31 December 2019).[17] WHO additionally uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.[16] WHO named variants of concern and variants of interest using Greek letters. The initial practice of naming them according to where the variants were identified (e.g. Delta began as the "Indian variant") is no longer common.[18] A more systematic naming scheme reflects the variant's PANGO lineage (e.g., Omicron's lineage is B.1.1.529) and is used for other variants.[19][20][21] Epidemiology For country-level data, see: COVID-19 pandemic by country and territory Cases 771,820,173[3] Deaths 6,978,162[3] As of 19 November 2023 Africa Asia Europe North America Oceania South America Antarctica Background Main articles: Origin of COVID-19 and COVID-19 pandemic in Hubei SARS-CoV-2 is a virus closely related to bat coronaviruses,[22] pangolin coronaviruses,[23][24] and SARS-CoV.[25] The first known outbreak (the 2019–2020 COVID-19 outbreak in mainland China) started in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019. Many early cases were linked to people who had visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market there,[26][27][28] but it is possible that human-to-human transmission began earlier.[29][30] The scientific consensus is that the virus is most likely of a zoonotic origin, from bats or another closely related mammal.[29][31][32] Controversies about the origins of the virus, including the lab leak theory, heightened geopolitical divisions, notably between the United States and China.[33] The earliest known infected person fell ill on 1 December 2019. That individual did not have a connection with the later wet market cluster.[34][35] However, an earlier case may have occurred on 17 November.[36] Two-thirds of the initial case cluster were linked with the market.[37][38][39] Molecular clock analysis suggests that the index case is likely to have been infected between mid-October and mid-November 2019.[40][41] Cases Main articles: COVID-19 pandemic by country and territory and COVID-19 pandemic cases Official "case" counts refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols whether or not they experienced symptomatic disease.[42][43] Due to the effect of sampling bias, studies which obtain a more accurate number by extrapolating from a random sample have consistently found that total infections considerably exceed the reported case counts.[44][45] Many countries, early on, had official policies to not test those with only mild symptoms.[46][47] The strongest risk factors contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 51 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic responseCode 3 200
