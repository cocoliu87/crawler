International Organization for Standardization Organisation internationale de normalisation Abbreviation ISO Formation 23 February 1947; 76 years ago (1947-02-23) Type Non-governmental organization Purpose International standards development Headquarters Geneva, Switzerland Membership 168 members (39 correspondents and 4 subscribers) Official languages English French Russian[1] President Ulrika Francke Website www.iso.org [2] The International Organization for Standardization (ISO /ˈaɪsoʊ/[3]) is an international standard development organization composed of representatives from the national standards organizations of member countries.[4] Membership requirements are given in Article 3 of the ISO Statutes.[5] ISO was founded on 23 February 1947, and (as of November 2022[update]) it has published over 24,500 international standards covering almost all aspects of technology and manufacturing. It has 811 technical committees (TCs) and subcommittees (SCs) to take care of standards development.[6] The organization develops and publishes standardization in all technical and nontechnical fields other than electrical and electronic engineering, which is handled by the IEC.[7] It is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland,[8] and works in 167 countries as of 2023[update]. The three official languages of ISO are English, French, and Russian.[1] Overview[edit] The International Organization for Standardization is an independent, non-governmental organization, whose membership consists of different national standards bodies.[9] As of 2022[update], there are 167 members representing ISO in their country, with each country having only one member.[8] The organization develops and publishes international standards in all technical and nontechnical fields other than electrical and electronic engineering, which are the responsibility of the International Electrotechnical Commission.[7] As of February 2023[update], ISO has developed over 24,676 standards, covering everything from manufactured products and technology to food safety, agriculture, and healthcare.[8][10] Name and abbreviations[edit] The International Organization for Standardization in French is Organisation internationale de normalisation and in Russian, Международная организация по стандартизации (Mezhdunarodnaya organizatsiya po standartizatsii). Although one might think ISO is an abbreviation for "International Standardization Organization" or a similar title in another language, the letters do not officially represent an acronym or initialism. The organization provides this explanation of the name: Because 'International Organization for Standardization' would have different acronyms in different languages (IOS in English, OIN in French), our founders decided to give it the short form ISO. ISO is derived from the Greek word isos (ίσος, meaning "equal"). Whatever the country, whatever the language, the short form of our name is always ISO.[11] During the founding meetings of the new organization, however, the Greek word explanation was not invoked, so this meaning may be a false etymology.[12] Both the name ISO and the ISO logo are registered trademarks and their use is restricted.[13] History[edit] Plaque marking the building in Prague where the ISO predecessor, the ISA, was founded. The organization that is known today as ISO began in 1926 as the International Federation of the National Standardizing Associations (ISA), which primarily focused on mechanical engineering. The ISA was suspended in 1942 during World War II but, after the war, the ISA was approached by the recently-formed United Nations Standards Coordinating Committee (UNSCC) with a proposal to form a new global standards body.[14] In October 1946, ISA and UNSCC delegates from 25 countries met in London and agreed to join forces to create the International Organization for Standardization. The organization officially began operations on 23 February 1947.[15][16] ISO Standards were originally known as ISO Recommendations (ISO/R), e.g., "ISO 1" was issued in 1951 as "ISO/R 1".[17] Structure and organization[edit] ISO is a voluntary organization whose members are recognized authorities on standards, each one representing one country. Members meet annually at a General Assembly to discuss the strategic objectives of ISO. The organization is coordinated by a central secretariat based in Geneva.[18] A council with a rotating membership of 20 member bodies provides guidance and governance, including setting the annual budget of the central secretariat.[18][19] The technical management board is responsible for more than 250 technical committees, who develop the ISO standards.[18][20][21][22] Joint technical committee with IEC[edit] Main article: ISO/IEC JTC 1 ISO has a joint technical committee (JTC) with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) to develop standards relating to information technology (IT). Known as JTC 1 and entitled "Information technology", it was created in 1987 and its mission is "to develop worldwide Information and Communication Technology (ICT) standards for business and consumer applications."[23][24] There was previously also a JTC 2 that was created in 2009 for a joint project to establish common terminology for "standardization in the field of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources".[25] It was later disbanded. Membership[edit] Further information: Countries in the International Organization for Standardization A map of ISO members as of November 2020 ISO member countries with a national standards body and ISO voting rights Correspondent members (countries without a national standards body) Subscriber members (countries with small economies) As of 2022[update], there are 167 national members representing ISO in their country, with each country having only one member.[8][9] ISO has three membership categories,[2] Member bodies are national bodies considered the most representative standards body in each country. These are the only members of ISO that have voting rights. Correspondent members are countries that do not have their own standards organization. These members are informed about the work of ISO, but do not participate in standards promulgation. Subscriber members are countries with small economies. They pay reduced membership fees, but can follow the development of standards. Participating members are called "P" members, as opposed to observing members, who are called "O" members. Financing[edit] ISO is funded by a combination of:[26] Organizations that manage the specific projects or loan experts to participate in the technical work Subscriptions from member bodies, whose subscriptions are in proportion to each country's gross national product and trade figures Sale of standards International standards and other publications[edit] See also: List of ISO standards International standards are the main products of ISO. It also publishes technical reports, technical specifications, publicly available specifications, technical corrigenda, and guides.[27][28] International standards These are designated using the format ISO[/IEC] [/ASTM] [IS] nnnnn[-p]:[yyyy] Title, where nnnnn is the number of the standard, p is an optional part number, yyyy is the year published, and Title describes the subject. IEC for International Electrotechnical Commission is included if the standard results from the work of ISO/IEC JTC 1 (the ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee). ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) is used for standards developed in cooperation with ASTM International. yyyy and IS are not used for an incomplete or unpublished standard and, under some circumstances, may be left off the title of a published work. Technical reports These are issued when a technical committee or subcommittee has collected data of a different kind from that normally published as an International Standard,[27] such as references and explanations. The naming conventions for these are the same as for standards, except TR prepended instead of IS in the report's name. For example: ISO/IEC TR 17799:2000 Code of Practice for Information Security Management ISO/TR 19033:2000 Technical product documentation – Metadata for construction documentation Technical and publicly available specifications Technical specifications may be produced when "the subject in question is still under development or where for any other reason there is the future but not immediate possibility of an agreement to publish an International Standard". A publicly available specification is usually "an intermediate specification, published prior to the development of a full International Standard, or, in IEC may be a 'dual logo' publication published in collaboration with an external organization".[27] By convention, both types of specification are named in a manner similar to the organization's technical reports. For example: ISO/TS 16952-1:2006 Technical product documentation – Reference designation system – Part 1: General application rules (later withdrawn and replaced by ISO/TS 81346-3:2012, which was later withdrawn) ISO/PAS 11154:2006 Road vehicles – Roof load carriers (later revised in ISO 11154:2023, which does not have the "PAS" abbreviation in its name) Technical corrigenda When partnering with IEC in their joint technical committee, ISO also sometimes issues "technical corrigenda" (where "corrigenda" is the plural of corrigendum). These are amendments made to existing standards to correct minor technical flaws or ambiguities.[27] ISO guides These are meta-standards covering "matters related to international standardization".[27] They are named using the format "ISO[/IEC] Guide N:yyyy: Title".
