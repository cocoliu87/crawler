The city has almost 3.4 million[7] inhabitants and a metropolitan area population of approximately 6.7 million. It is the second-largest city in the European Union (EU), and its monocentric metropolitan area is the second-largest in the EU.[8][9][10] The municipality covers 604.3 km2 (233.3 sq mi) geographical area.[11] Madrid lies on the River Manzanares in the central part of the Iberian Peninsula at about 650 metres above mean sea level. Capital city of both Spain and the surrounding autonomous community of Madrid (since 1983),[12] it is also the political, economic and cultural centre of the country.[13] The climate of Madrid features hot summers and cool winters. The Madrid urban agglomeration has the second-largest GDP[14] in the European Union and its influence in politics, education, entertainment, environment, media, fashion, science, culture, and the arts all contribute to its status as one of the world's major global cities.[15][16] Due to its economic output, high standard of living, and market size, Madrid is considered the major financial centre[17] and the leading economic hub of the Iberian Peninsula and of Southern Europe.[18][19] The metropolitan area hosts major Spanish companies such as Telefónica, Iberia, BBVA and FCC.[20] It concentrates the bulk of banking operations in the country and it is the Spanish-speaking city generating the largest amount of webpages.[20] For innovation, Madrid is ranked 19th in the world and 7th in Europe from 500 cities, in the 2022–2023 annual analysts Innovation Cities Index, published by 2ThinkNow.[21] Madrid houses the headquarters of the UN's World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), the Ibero-American General Secretariat (SEGIB), the Organization of Ibero-American States (OEI), and the Public Interest Oversight Board (PIOB). It also hosts major international regulators and promoters of the Spanish language: the Standing Committee of the Association of Spanish Language Academies, headquarters of the Royal Spanish Academy (RAE), the Instituto Cervantes and the Foundation of Urgent Spanish (FundéuRAE). Madrid organises fairs such as FITUR,[22] ARCO,[23] SIMO TCI[24] and the Madrid Fashion Week.[25] Madrid is home to two world-famous football clubs, Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid. While Madrid possesses modern infrastructure, it has preserved the look and feel of many of its historic neighbourhoods and streets. Its landmarks include the Plaza Mayor, the Royal Palace of Madrid; the Royal Theatre with its restored 1850 Opera House; the Buen Retiro Park, founded in 1631; the 19th-century National Library building (founded in 1712) containing some of Spain's historical archives; many national museums,[26] and the Golden Triangle of Art, located along the Paseo del Prado and comprising three art museums: Prado Museum, the Reina Sofía Museum, a museum of modern art, and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, which complements the holdings of the other two museums.[27] Cibeles Palace and Fountain has become one of the monument symbols of the city.[28][29] The mayor is José Luis Martínez-Almeida from the People's Party.[30] Etymology[edit] There are various theories regarding the origin of the toponym "Madrid" (all of them with problems when it comes to fully explain the phonetic evolution of the toponym along history), namely:[31] A Celtic origin (Madrid < *Magetoritum;[32] with the root "-ritu" meaning "ford"). From the Arabic maǧrà (meaning "water stream")[32] or majrit (مجريط meaning "spring", "fountain").[33] The latter is the first documented name of the settlement.[33] A Mozarabic variant of the Latin matrix, matricis (also meaning "water stream").[32] History[edit] Main article: History of Madrid For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Madrid. The site of modern-day Madrid has been occupied since prehistoric times,[34][35][36] and there are archaeological remains of the Celtic Carpetani settlement, Roman villas,[37] a Visigoth basilica near the church of Santa María de la Almudena[38] and three Visigoth necropolises near Casa de Campo, Tetuán and Vicálvaro.[39] Middle Ages[edit] The first historical document about the existence of an established settlement in Madrid dates from the Muslim age. In the second half of the 9th century,[40] Umayyad Emir Muhammad I built a fortress on a headland near the river Manzanares[41] as one of the many fortresses he ordered to be built on the border between Al-Andalus and the kingdoms of León and Castile, with the objective of protecting Toledo from the Christian invasions and also as a starting point for Muslim offensives. After the disintegration of the Caliphate of Córdoba in the early 11th century, Madrid was integrated in the Taifa of Toledo. In the context of the wider campaign for the conquest of the taifa of Toledo initiated in 1079, Madrid was seized in 1083 by Alfonso VI of León and Castile, who sought to use the town as an offensive outpost against the city of Toledo,[42] in turn conquered in 1085. Following the conquest, Christians occupied the center of the city, while Muslims and Jews were displaced to the suburbs. Madrid, located near Alcalá (under Muslim control until 1118), remained a borderland for a while, suffering a number of razzias during the Almoravid period, and its walls were destroyed in 1110.[42] The city was confirmed as villa de realengo [es] (linked to the Crown) in 1123, during the reign of Alfonso VII.[43] The 1123 Charter of Otorgamiento established the first explicit limits between Madrid and Segovia, namely the Puerto de El Berrueco and the Puerto de Lozoya.[44] Beginning in 1188, Madrid had the right to be a city with representation in the courts of Castile.[citation needed] In 1202, Alfonso VIII gave Madrid its first charter to regulate the municipal council,[45] which was expanded in 1222 by Ferdinand III. The government system of the town was changed to a regimiento of 12 regidores by Alfonso XI on 6 January 1346.[46] Starting in the mid-13th century and up to the late 14th century, the concejo of Madrid vied for the control of the Real de Manzanares territory against the concejo of Segovia, a powerful town north of the Sierra de Guadarrama mountain range, characterised by its repopulating prowess and its husbandry-based economy, contrasted by the agricultural and less competent in repopulation town of Madrid.[47] After the decline of Sepúlveda, another concejo north of the mountain range, Segovia had become a major actor south of the Guadarrama mountains, expanding across the Lozoya and Manzanares rivers to the north of Madrid and along the Guadarrama river course to its west.[47] In 1309, the Courts of Castile convened at Madrid for the first time under Ferdinand IV, and later in 1329, 1339, 1391, 1393, 1419 and twice in 1435. Modern Age[edit] During the revolt of the Comuneros, led by Juan Lopez de Padilla, Madrid joined the revolt against Charles, Holy Roman Emperor, but after defeat at the Battle of Villalar, Madrid was besieged and occupied by the imperial troops. The city was however granted the titles of Coronada (Crowned) and Imperial. View of Madrid from the west, facing the Puerta de la Vega. Drawing by Anton van den Wyngaerde, 1562.

The poor population of the court was composed of ex-soldiers, foreigners, rogues and Ruanes, dissatisfied with the lack of food and high prices. In June 1561 Phillip II set his court in Madrid, installing it in the old alcázar.[48] Thanks to this, the city of Madrid became the political centre of the monarchy, being the capital of Spain except for a short period between 1601 and 1606, in which the Court was relocated to Valladolid (and the Madrid population temporarily plummeted accordingly). Being the capital was decisive for the evolution of the city and influenced its fate and during the rest of the reign of Philip II, the population boomed, going up from about 18,000 in 1561 to 80,000 in 1598.[49] View of Calle de Alcalá in 1750 by Antonio Joli During the early 17th century, although Madrid recovered from the loss of the capital status, with the return of diplomats, lords and affluent people, as well as an entourage of noted writers and artists together with them, extreme poverty was however rampant.[50] The century also was a time of heyday for theatre, represented in the so-called corrales de comedias.[51] The city changed hands several times during the War of the Spanish Succession: from the Bourbon control it passed to the allied "Austracist" army with Portuguese and English pres contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 40 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Madrid responseCode 3 200
