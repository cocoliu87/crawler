fcecpimmtibeamxkiqlmqcpatmvspkokxejebqjo length 6 166800 page 10008 A list of the articles chosen to be "Wikipedia:Today's featured article" in the last six months or so, to help those wanting to know whether there's been a recent article on a particular topic when considering nominating something at the requests page. It also provides details of page views, which may be helpful for determining correlations between reader views and subject areas. The first item in the "FA category" column reflects the article's location at Wikipedia:Featured articles; the following elements are unofficial attempts to help be more specific (within reason). The country reflects (in most cases) the current political entity without subdividing by state, etc. The "how chosen" column shows whether the article was nominated at the requests page or chosen by the TFA coordinators (Bencherlite for TFAs up to December 2014; Brianboulton, Crisco 1492, and Dank up to November 2016; Crisco 1492, Dank, Jimfbleak, and Mike Christie from December through March 2017; Dank, Jimfbleak, and Mike Christie from April to October 2017; Dank, Jimfbleak, Ealdgyth, and Wehwalt from October 2017 to February 2021; Dank, Jimfbleak, and Wehwalt until November 2021; Jimfbleak and Wehwalt from November 2021 through July 2023 and from 1 August 2023, Wehwalt, Dank and Gog the Mild). Archived nominations can be found at Category:Wikipedia Today's featured article nominations; the archive is complete from April 2014 to date, and is mostly complete from November 2012 onwards. Up until 30 September 2015, page view statistics are based on Henrik's page view tool at http://stats.grok.se/. Please note that at some point since December 2013 this tool began compiling days using a 23:00 to 22:59 (UTC) time range to match the range that wikiviewstats uses rather than the 00:00 to 23:59 (UTC) time range that it had previously used. Also, note that these statistics ignore mobile viewers. Only page views on the day the article was featured are counted, and not the following three days during which it appears below the featured article. If page view figures are missing for a particular day, it is because they have not been analysed by the page view tool (usually due to omissions in the source data). See Wikipedia:Today's featured article/Most viewed for a selected list of articles that have attracted over 100,000 page views on the day on which they were featured. Such articles are indicated on this list in bold text. Starting from 1 October 2015, page view statistics are based on MusikAnimal's tool at toollabs:pageviews, which uses a Wikimedia API. Please add TFAs in the following way (all dates in yyyy|mm|dd format): Date; article; category; country; promotion date; promotion date and TFA date; page view column; TFAR or coordinator |-
