The Balearic Islands (Catalan: Illes Balears [ˈiʎəz bəleˈas]; Spanish: Islas Baleares[1][2][3] [ˈislas βaleˈaɾes] /ˌbæliˈærɪk/ BAL-ee-ARR-ik or /bəˈlɪərɪk/ bə-LEER-ik[4][5]) are an archipelago in the western Mediterranean Sea, near the eastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula. The archipelago conforms a province and autonomous community of Spain, with Palma de Mallorca being its capital and largest city. Formerly part of the Kingdom of Mallorca, the islands conformed a province in the 19th century provincial division, which in 1983 received a Statute of Autonomy. In its later reform of 2007, the Statute designates the Balearic Islands as one of the nationalities of Spain.[6] The official languages of the Balearic Islands are Catalan and Spanish. The archipielago islands are further grouped in western Pytiuses (the largest being Ibiza and Formentera), and eastern Gymnesians (the largest being Mallorca and Menorca). Many of its minor islands and islets are close to the larger islands, including Cabrera, Dragonera, and S'Espalmador. The islands have a Mediterranean climate, and the four major islands are all popular tourist destinations. Ibiza, in particular, is known as an international party destination, attracting many of the world's most popular DJs to its nightclubs.[7] The islands' culture and cuisine are similar to those of the rest of Spain but have their own distinctive features. Etymology[edit] The official name of the Balearic Islands in Catalan is Illes Balears, while in Spanish, they are known as the Islas Baleares. The ancient Greeks usually adopted local names into their own language, but they called the islands Γυμνησίαι/Gymnesiai, unlike the native inhabitants of the islands, as well as the Carthaginians and Romans, who called them Βαλεαρεῖς/Baleareis.[8] The term "Balearic" may derive from Greek (Γυμνησίαι/Gymnesiae and Βαλλιαρεῖς/Balliareis).[9] In Latin, it was Baleares. Of the various theories on the origins of the two ancient Greek and Latin names for the islands—Gymnasiae and Baleares—classical sources provide two. According to Lycophron's Alexandra verses, the islands were called Γυμνησίαι/Gymnesiae (γυμνός/gymnos, meaning naked in Greek) because its inhabitants were often nude, probably because of the balmy year-round climate. However, Strabo thought that Gymnesiai probably referred to the light equipment used by the Balearic troops γυμνῆται/gymnetae.[10] Most of the ancient Greek and Roman writers thought that the name of the people, (βαλεαρεῖς/baleareis, from βάλλω/ballo: ancient Greek meaning "to launch") was based on their skill as slingers. However, Strabo thought the name was of Phoenician origin. He observed that it was the Phoenician word for lightly armoured soldiers, which the ancient Greeks called γυμνῆτας/gymnetas.[10] The root bal arguably suggests a Phoenician origin; Strabo, in Volume III, Book XIV of his Geography suggests that the name comes from the Phoenician balearides.[11] Geology[edit] The Balearic Islands are on a raised platform called the Balearic Promontory, and were formed by uplift. They are cut by a network of northwest to southeast faults.[12][13] Geography and hydrography[edit] Majorca in 2007 The main islands of the autonomous community are Majorca (Mallorca), Menorca/Minorca (Menorca), Ibiza (Eivissa/Ibiza), and Formentera, all popular tourist destinations. Amongst the minor islands is Cabrera, the location of the Cabrera Archipelago Maritime-Terrestrial National Park. Neighbours: Algeria (south), Spain's Catalonia and Valencian Community (west), France's South (north), and France's Corsica as well as Italy's Sardinia (east). Balearic Islands has the longest coastline of any provinces in Spain, with a length of coastline 1,428 kilometres. The islands can be further grouped, with Majorca, Menorca, and Cabrera as the Gymnesian Islands (Illes Gimnèsies), and Ibiza and Formentera as the Pityusic Islands (Illes Pitiüses officially in Catalan), also referred to as the Pityuses (or sometimes informally in English as the Pine Islands). Many minor islands or islets are close to the biggest islands, such as Es Conills, Es Vedrà, Sa Conillera, Dragonera, S'Espalmador, S'Espardell, Ses Bledes, Santa Eulària, Plana, Foradada, Tagomago, Na Redona, Colom, L'Aire, etc. The Balearic Front is a sea density regime north of the Balearic Islands on the shelf slope of the Balearic Islands, which is responsible for some of the surface-flow characteristics of the Balearic Sea.[14] Climate[edit] Located in the west of the Mediterranean Sea, the Balearic Islands have mostly typical hot-summer Mediterranean climates (Köppen: Csa) with some high altitude areas having a Warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csb) in the island of Majorca. The semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSh and BSk) is also found in the Balearic Islands, mostly on the islands of Ibiza and Formentera but also in the southern part of Majorca.[15] Climate data for Palma, Port (1981–2010) 3 metres (9.8 feet) (Satellite view) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Average high °C (°F) 15.4 (59.7) 15.5 (59.9) 17.2 (63.0) 19.2 (66.6) 22.5 (72.5) 26.5 (79.7) 29.4 (84.9) 29.8 (85.6) 27.1 (80.8) 23.7 (74.7) 19.3 (66.7) 16.5 (61.7) 21.8 (71.2) Daily mean °C (°F) 11.9 (53.4) 11.9 (53.4) 13.4 (56.1) 15.5 (59.9) 18.8 (65.8) 22.7 (72.9) 25.7 (78.3) 26.2 (79.2) 23.5 (74.3) 20.2 (68.4) 15.8 (60.4) 13.1 (55.6) 18.2 (64.8) Average low °C (°F) 8.3 (46.9) 8.4 (47.1) 9.6 (49.3) 11.7 (53.1) 15.1 (59.2) 18.9 (66.0) 21.9 (71.4) 22.5 (72.5) 19.9 (67.8) 16.6 (61.9) 12.3 (54.1) 9.7 (49.5) 14.6 (58.3) Average precipitation mm (inches) 43 (1.7) 37 (1.5) 28 (1.1) 39 (1.5) 36 (1.4) 11 (0.4) 6 (0.2) 22 (0.9) 52 (2.0) 69 (2.7) 59 (2.3) 48 (1.9) 449 (17.7) Average precipitation days (≥ 1 mm) 6 6 5 5 4 2 1 2 5 7 6 7 53 Mean monthly sunshine hours 167 170 205 237 284 315 346 316 227 205 161 151 2,779 Source: Agencia Estatal de Meteorología[16] Climate data for Ibiza Airport (1981–2010) 6 metres (20 feet) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Average high °C (°F) 15.7 (60.3) 15.9 (60.6) 17.7 (63.9) 19.7 (67.5) 22.7 (72.9) 26.8 (80.2) 29.7 (85.5) 30.3 (86.5) 27.7 (81.9) 24.0 (75.2) 19.6 (67.3) 16.7 (62.1) 22.2 (72.0) Daily mean °C (°F) 11.9 (53.4) 12.1 (53.8) 13.7 (56.7) 15.6 (60.1) 18.6 (65.5) 22.6 (72.7) 25.6 (78.1) 26.3 (79.3) 23.8 (74.8) 20.2 (68.4) 15.9 (60.6) 13.1 (55.6) 18.3 (64.9) Average low °C (°F) 8.1 (46.6) 8.3 (46.9) 9.6 (49.3) 11.4 (52.5) 14.6 (58.3) 18.4 (65.1) 21.4 (70.5) 22.2 (72.0) 19.9 (67.8) 16.5 (61.7) 12.3 (54.1) 9.5 (49.1) 14.3 (57.7) Average precipitation mm (inches) 37 (1.5) 36 (1.4) 27 (1.1) 31 (1.2) 27 (1.1) 11 (0.4) 5 (0.2) 18 (0.7) 57 (2.2) 58 (2.3) 53 (2.1) 52 (2.0) 413 (16.3) Mean monthly sunshine hours 162 166 211 246 272 299 334 305 236 205 157 151 2,744 Source: Agencia Estatal de Meteorología[17] Climate data for Menorca Airport (1981–2010) 91 metres (299 feet) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Average high °C (°F) 14.1 (57.4) 14.2 (57.6) 15.9 (60.6) 18.0 (64.4) 21.6 (70.9) 25.8 (78.4) 28.9 (84.0) 29.2 (84.6) 26.2 (79.2) 22.7 (72.9) 18.1 (64.6) 15.2 (59.4) 20.8 (69.4) Daily mean °C (°F) 10.8 (51.4) 10.8 (51.4) 12.3 (54.1) 14.3 (57.7) 17.8 (64.0) 21.8 (71.2) 24.9 (76.8) 25.4 (77.7) 22.6 (72.7) 19.4 (66.9) 14.9 (58.8) 12.1 (53.8) 17.2 (63.0) Average low °C (°F) 7.5 (45.5) 7.4 (45.3) 8.6 (47.5) 10.6 (51.1) 13.9 (57.0) 17.8 (64.0) 20.8 (69.4) 21.5 (70.7) 18.9 (66.0) 16.1 (61.0) 11.6 (52.9) 9.0 (48.2) 13.6 (56.5) Average precipitation mm (inches) 52 (2.0) 54 (2.1) 38 (1.5) 45 (1.8) 37 (1.5) 14 (0.6) 3 (0.1) 20 (0.8) 61 (2.4) 78 (3.1) 88 (3.5) 61 (2.4) 546 (21.5) Mean monthly sunshine hours 144 146 202 222 270 311 347 312 225 183 142 130 2,632 Source: Agencia Estatal de Meteorología[18] History[edit] Ancient history[edit] Map of the Balearic Islands, c. 2006 The earliest known evidence of inhabitation of the Balearic Islands is dated to the 3rd millennium BC, around 2500-2300 BC from the Iberian Peninsula or southern France, by people associated with the Bell Beaker culture.[19][20] Little is recorded on the inhabitants of the islands during classical antiquity, though many legends exist. The story, preserved by Lycophron, that certain shipwrecked Greek Boeotians were cast nude on the islands, was evidently invented to account for the name Gymnesiae (Ancient Greek: Γυμνήσιαι). In addition, Diodorus Siculus writes that the Greeks called the islands Gymnesiae because the inhabitants were naked (γυμνοί) during the summer time.[21] Also, a tradition holds that the islands were colonized by Rhodes after the Trojan War.[10] The islands had a very mixed population. Several stories describing them as having unusual habits. Some have it that they went naked year-round (a folk etymology claims this inspired the islands’ name), some say they went naked only in the summer, contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 50 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Balearic_Islands responseCode 3 200
