Although it is generally scheduled and edited by a small group of regular editors, anyone can contribute. If you have concerns about today's or tomorrow's POTDs, please place a message at Wikipedia:Main Page/Errors. If you have concerns about other upcoming POTDs, consider either fixing it yourself or placing a message at Wikipedia talk:Picture of the day. Today's featured picture In archaeology, the Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC), also known as the Oxus Civilization, refers to a Middle Bronze Age civilization of southern Central Asia, existing in its urban phase from circa 2400 to 1950 BC. Most of the BMAC's urban sites are actually located in Margiana (modern Turkmenistan) on the Marghab River delta, and in the Kopet Dag mountains. There are a few later sites in northern Bactria, in what is now southern Uzbekistan, but these are mostly graveyards belonging to the BMAC-related Sapalli culture. A single BMAC site lies in southern Bactria, in the north of modern Afghanistan. Sites found further east, in southwestern Tajikistan, though contemporary with the main BMAC sites in Margiana, are only graveyards, with no urban developments associated with them. This BMAC statuette of a seated female is an example of a "Bactrian princess", dating to between the late 3rd and early 2nd millennium BC. It is made of steatite or chlorite and alabaster, with dimensions of 3+9⁄16 in × 3+11⁄16 in × 1+7⁄8 in (9.0 cm × 9.4 cm × 4.8 cm). The sculpture is now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

To nominate a picture to be featured, see Featured picture candidates. Featured pictures are currently selected in roughly the order in which they were promoted (i.e. a first in, first out order). See the category of featured pictures that have not appeared on the Main Page for this order. Exceptions are made for birthdays, anniversaries of events, national holidays or other occasions worth commemorating. Linked articles must be up to scratch – at a minimum, the article should not be a stub, and the image used must appear in the article. All facts mentioned in the blurb must be found in the target article, or in the description linked to the image itself (if it's a specific detail not relevant to the article topic). All facts used in the blurb must have a citation to a reliable source, either in the linked article or in the image description page. Not all featured pictures will appear as the picture of the day. Wikipedia:Picture of the day/Unused has a list of those that have been skipped. Pictures of the day on your user page[edit] You can insert the picture of the day on your user page or talk page by adding the text {{Pic of the day}}. It will be displayed in a box of no more than 600 pixels wide and will include the blurb associated with the picture. A version without text is also available via {{POTD}}. It is also possible to create your own custom POTD layouts, in case you do not wish to use the existing versions. Mix and match the following components to make your own. This system will only work for pictures of the day beginning January 1, 2007. Be sure to replace [date] with an appropriate date value. For a dynamically updating version, use {{#time:Y-m-d}} (example: {{POTD/{{#time:Y-m-d}}|image}}).

Used on some of the Main Page alternatives and also suitable for user pages. {{POTD/{{#time:Y-m-d}}|row}}: This has the image and caption encapsulated in (usually) a single table row. This is the version used on the current Main Page. It is also possible to permanently feature a POTD for a selected day. Just add a specific value for the date you want. For example, today's picture of the day is {{POTD/2023-11-20|image}}. Likewise, you can use date parameters with the other templates as well. If you like the pre-made formats, you can use date parameters there as well, like this: {{Pic of the day|date=2023-11-20}} or {{POTD|date=2023-11-20}}. Again, this system will only work for pictures of the day beginning January 1, 2007. As a userbox[edit] Code Result {{User:CFeyecare/templates/POTD}} This user enjoys the Picture of the Day.¤ Usage Random picture of the day[edit] Use {{User:My Chemistry romantic/Templates/Random POTD}} to display a randomly selected picture of the day. {{User:Tyw7/picofday}} also displays a randomly selected POTD, but without the header and footer. As a thumbnail[edit] When you want to display the picture of the day like an ordinary thumbnail, similar to {{WP:Wikimedia Commons/POTD}}, you can use {{POTD Wikipedia}}. For instance, if you want a thumbnailed version, floated right, you can use {{POTD Wikipedia|float=right|title=yes|thumb=yes}}. Older pictures of the day[edit] If you want to permanently include a POTD that was selected between November 1, 2004 and December 31, 2006, use the following: {{Wikipedia:Picture of the day/[month] [day], [year]}} or {{Wikipedia:POTD/[month] [day], [year]}}. For example, {{Wikipedia:Picture of the day/December 31, 2006}}. Pictures of the day selected from May 2004 through October 2004 are only accessible in month-at-a-time archives (see below) and can only be placed on user pages by using standard image syntax.
