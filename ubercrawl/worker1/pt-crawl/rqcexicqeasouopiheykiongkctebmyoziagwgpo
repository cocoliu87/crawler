Russia accused Ukraine of being responsible for these attacks. Ukraine did not claim responsibility for most of the attacks and had formally denied being behind some of them. Shelling, drone strikes and sabotage February–March 2022 On 25 February 2022, the Millerovo air base was attacked, allegedly with Tochka-U missiles, presumedly by the Ukrainian 19th Missile Brigade.[3] On 1 March, there was an explosion on a military air base in Taganrog in Rostov Oblast. There were claims that it was due to Ukrainian action.[4] On 23 and 24 March, Governor of Belgorod Oblast Vyacheslav Gladkov reported that Zhuravlyovka and Nekhoteyevka came under shelling from the Ukrainian side. The next day, the Moscow Patriarchate claimed that chaplain Oleg Artyomov died in Zhuravlyovka as a result of a BM-30 Smerch strike by Ukraine.[5] On 29 March, local officials reported a series of explosions outside the city of Belgorod, close to the border with Ukraine. It was later reported that those explosions may have been caused by a fire.[6] April 2022 On 1 April, according to regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov and an unnamed US official, two Ukrainian Mi-24 helicopters attacked and set fire to a fuel depot in Belgorod in a low-altitude airstrike with no reported casualties.[7][8][9] Ukraine denied and dismissed the event as Russian propaganda.[10][11] Ukrainian security official Oleksiy Danilov denied Ukraine was behind the helicopter attack,[12][11] with a joke in which he blamed the "People's Republic of Belgorod" instead.[13][14][15] On the same day, a rocket exploded in a different part of the oblast, but its apparent trajectory and model led open-source researchers to suspect it was a failed Russian missile.[16] On 11 April, Belgorod, Bryansk, Kursk, and Voronezh Oblasts all raised their terror alert system to "yellow", the second tier in a three-class system.[17][18] The Republic of Crimea and Krasnodar Krai raised their alert levels in certain districts. Authorities in Belgorod ordered a two-week ban on fireworks and firecrackers.[17] On 14 April, the FSB border service reported that on 13 April, a border checkpoint near Novye Yurkovichi, Bryansk Oblast came under mortar fire from Ukraine while a group of around 30 Ukrainian refugees headed for Russia was present there. According to the official claims, two automobiles were damaged but no injuries were documented.[19][20][21][22] On the same day, regional and municipal authorities stated that Ukraine had shelled the village of Spodaryushino (near Mokraya Orlovka) in Belgorod Oblast, causing several explosions. While no injuries occurred, the village's population was temporarily evacuated, out of concerns about a possible escalation. A neighboring settlement also had its population relocated.[23] Governor of Belgorod Oblast Vyacheslav Gladkov said that the attack "had come from the Ukrainian side."[20] In a separate alleged attack a resident of Zhuravlyovka was injured, according to Gladkov.[24][25] On the same day, the Investigative Committee of Russia said Ukrainian attack helicopters had launched six missile strikes on residential areas in the town of Klimovo, Bryansk Oblast, damaging six buildings.[26][27] Officials at the Russian Health Ministry said that seven people had been injured, two of which had been hurt seriously.[27] According to personnel at the city's hospital, among those injured were a pregnant woman and a two-year-old child.[21][20] According to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, an unverified video of a house in Bryansk burning went viral on the internet.[21] The next day, Russian security services claimed they had shot down a Mil Mi-8 helicopter during the incident.[28] On 19 April, Belgorod's governor accused Ukrainian forces of striking the village of Golovchino, damaging more than 30 houses and lightly wounding 3 residents.[29] On 25 April, according to the Belgorod governor, at least two residents, a man and a woman, were injured in Zhuravlyovka as a result of shelling.[30] On the same day, another attack happened in Bryansk: in the morning, two large explosions and fires occurred at two oil facilities, a civilian one and a military one. Videos and images posted on social media showed large columns of black smoke several hours after the initial explosions. An analyst told The Guardian that the fires were likely an act of sabotage by Ukraine, although responsibility remained uncertain.[31][32] Unconfirmed reports in the Russian media suggested the fires could have been caused by a drone attack; on the same day, two Bayraktar TB2 drones were reportedly shot down in Bryansk Oblast.[33] On 29–30 April, a border checkpoint near Krupets in Rylsky District of Kursk Oblast was repeatedly shelled, according to the governor. The Bryansk governor said that his region was shelled as well.[34][35] May 2022 On 11 May, the Belgorod governor claimed that Solokhi was shelled from Ukraine. According to him, one person was killed and seven were injured as a result of the incident.[36] Videos online also showed damage to stores and private houses, local officials reportedly began evacuating the village after the attack.[37] The deceased was identified as Ruslan Nefyodov, aged 18.[38] On 15 May, Gladkov said that one person was injured with a shrapnel wound in Sereda [ru] after a Ukrainian strike,[39] as 10 shells were reportedly shot down by Russian air defense systems. Another 10 shells fell close to Novostroyevka-Vtoraya [ru], while another round of eight artillery shells reportedly damaged a power line and a number of farming structures in Zhuravlyovka.[40] On 17 May, Gladkov claimed that one more person was slightly injured in Bezymeno as it was shelled from the territory of Ukraine.[41] Kursk governor said that the border checkpoint at Tyotkino had been shelled once again on the same day, no victims were reported.[41] On 18 May, Gladkov declared that Solokhi was shelled again, and one person was reportedly injured.[42] Kursk governor Starovoyt reported that Alekseevka, Glushkovsky District [ru], was shelled.[43] On 19 May, Starovoyt claimed that a distillery in Tyotkino was shelled, a truck driver died, and at least one civili contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 90 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Attacks_in_Russia_during_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine responseCode 3 200
