On 7 October 2023, Hamas-led Palestinian militants[o] launched a multi-pronged invasion of southern Israel from the Gaza Strip.[48] The surprise attack comprised a barrage of rockets, while around 3,000 militants breached the Gaza–Israel barrier and attacked Israeli military bases and civilian population centres, as well as a music festival near Re'im. More than 800 Israeli civilians and more than 200 soldiers were killed during the invasion and an estimated 240[49] Israeli and foreign nationals were taken as captives or hostages to the Gaza Strip. As of Oct 11, at least 44 countries have condemned the attack as an act of terror, while other countries have criticized Israel’s occupation of Palestinian lands.[50][51] Hamas officials said their attack was a response to the blockade of the Gaza Strip, expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Israeli settler violence, restrictions on the movement of Palestinians, as well as aiming to liberate Israeli-occupied land, holy sites, and Palestinian prisoners[52][53][54][55] After clearing Hamas militants, the Israeli military responded by conducting an extensive aerial bombardment campaign in which 6,000 bombs were dropped on Gazan targets[56] over six days and by imposing a total blockade of the Gaza strip followed by a large-scale ground invasion of Gaza.[57][58] Israel's actions resulted in a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza.[59] Israel's declaration of a state of war marked the start of the most significant military escalation in the region since the Yom Kippur War in 1973. As of 14 November 2023[update] according to the Hamas-run Gazan Health Ministry, more than 13,000 Palestinians, including 5,500 children, have been killed.[60][17][61][62] Widespread civilian deaths have led to both Israel and Hamas being accused of war crimes.[63][64] Israel urged Gazans to evacuate northern Gaza, while Hamas called on residents to stay in their homes.[65][64][66] The United Nations reported that around 1.7 million Palestinians, over 70% of Gaza's population,[46] as well as around 500,000 Israelis have been internally displaced.[67] The war has led to a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The health system is on the brink of collapse, most hospitals are out of service,[68] and there are acute shortages of drinking water, food, fuel and medical supplies such as anesthetics for C-sections and amputations.[69][70] The United Nations has warned of the "immediate possibility" of starvation and the spread of disease in the region, due to the cutoff of water, fuel, food and electricity by Israel.[57][71][72] The war has sparked widespread global protests that have focused on ceasefire.[73][74][75] The United States vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire;[51] a week later, a non-binding advisory resolution passed overwhelmingly in the United Nations General Assembly.[76] Both Israel and Hamas have rejected calls for a ceasefire.[77] On 9 November, Israel agreed to daily four-hour "humanitarian pauses" to allow civilians to obtain food and medicine, as well as evacuate to the south.[78] On 15 November, the UN Security Council approved a resolution calling for "urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors throughout the Gaza Strip."[79] Israel's ambassador to the UN called the resolution "meaningless" and said Israel would ignore it.[79] Background See also: Israeli–Palestinian conflict and Gaza–Israel conflict The Gaza Strip and Israel have been in conflict since the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, which it had hitherto occupied since 1967. The United Nations and several human rights organizations continue to classify Gaza as held under Israeli occupation, due to its effective military control over the territory.[80][81] Hamas, an Islamist militant group, won the 2006 Palestinian legislative election and a subsequent battle in the Gaza Strip between it and Fatah, led to it taking over governance in the strip, which escalated tensions with Israel.[82][83] Israel, along with Egypt, imposed a blockade that significantly damaged Gaza's economy, citing security concerns as the justification.[84] International rights groups have characterized the blockade as a form of collective punishment,[85] while Israel defended it as necessary to prevent weapons and dual-use goods from entering the territory.[86][87] Since the blockade, Israel and Palestinian militants have had several clashes and made attacks on eac contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 63 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/2023_Israel%E2%80%93Hamas_war responseCode 3 200
