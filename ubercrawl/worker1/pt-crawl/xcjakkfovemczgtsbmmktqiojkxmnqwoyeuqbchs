Would it be possible to move the article up to 11 November, which would be his 49th birthday? I have created a blurb here. Feel free to change it any way you want. FrB.TG (talk) 17:15, 11 September 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Hi FrB.TG. 11 November is the anniversary of the end of the First World War, hence the war memorial article. That said, I see the logic of the DiCaprio article going there, so if you like I could start a discussion at TFAR and see what the community thinks. Gog the Mild (talk) 13:23, 12 September 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] FrB.TG: a rethink, I'll just do it. Gog the Mild (talk) 13:29, 12 September 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] questions about blurbs[edit] for a trial period, i plan to ask questions about tfa blurbs mostly on the monthly tfa archive talk pages instead of on fac nominator talk pages. i would appreciate any feedback on whether this is an improvement or not. dying (talk) 21:59, 17 October 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Hi dying, some initial feedback. I like the new system. Your copy edits and notes are excellent. The two weeks lead time gives time for the TFA and/or FAC nominator to respond. And if they haven't after two or three days, for me to do so. And time for a bit of back and forth to thrash out anything not straight forward. I feel that Rodrigues night heron is a good example of this leaving a happy nominator and coordinator - as well as an improved blurb - which would probably not have been the case previously. And it is an open and timely process subject to input from any editor who cares to comment - and so thoroughly Wikipedian. A couple of comments: Do you follow the discussions once you have posted your comments, or should I ping you if I want your attention or would like a response? Would it be possible to have a separate level two section for each blurb, rather that group all of them under "questions about blurbs"? Anything you would like to input on how this seems to be going from your perspective? I was weighing the benefits of putting a small tick "Y" in the title of a section when I considered it to be "closed". Obviously, any editor could still comment on any blurb, and you could remove the tick if you disagreed with me. But it would help me to keep track of what I still need to be checking for additional comments and where it had been agreed that your comments had been fully addressed. Your thoughts? @Dank and Wehwalt: any thoughts from you? Gog the Mild (talk) 21:38, 25 October 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] I'd like to be sure that the FAC nominator is aware of any discussion. Perhaps they could be pinged. Wehwalt (talk) 22:47, 25 October 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] dying believes that the nominator is pinged. Let us test that: article blurb nominator Blah, blah, blah. Does this ping you? Gog the Mild (talk) 23:09, 25 October 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] It did.--Wehwalt (talk) 00:51, 26 October 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Also, I'm planning on amending my standard notification that is left on FAC nominator's page to "This is to let you know that the above article has been scheduled as today's featured article for X December 2023. Please check that the article needs no amendments. Feel free to amend the draft blurb, which can be found at Wikipedia:Today's featured article/December 2023, or to make comments on other matters concerning the scheduling of this article at Wikipedia talk:Today's featured article/December 2023. Please keep an eye on that page, as comments regarding the draft blurb may be left there by user:dying, who assists the coordinators by making suggestions on the blurbs, or by others. I also suggest that you watchlist Wikipedia:Main Page/Errors from two days before it appears on the Main Page. Thanks and congratulations on your work!"—Wehwalt (talk) 22:51, 25 October 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] A sound thought. I shall shamelessly steal that. Gog the Mild (talk) 23:02, 25 October 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Everything seems to be running smoothly so far, both in October and November. I'll take another look in December. - Dank (push to talk) 22:47, 26 October 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] thanks for the feedback, Gog! yes, i follow the discussions. when i posted to user talk pages, i think i generally responded within a day or two, and i will try to continue to do so here. i admittedly needed to pull back from tfa for a few days recently as i was feeling burnt out from the temporary workload increase, but i should be able to return to the open issues below shortly. in any case, feel free to ping me whenever you wish, especially if it looks like i may have forgotten to respond to something. i think using level two sections for each blurb is a good idea, and have started doing so. i haven't changed the levels for the previous posts, just in case anyone has subscribed to the overarching level two section to keep track of comments for any specific blurb, but i won't mind if you changed them. i am also liking the new format. i had generally felt guilty about posting to user talk pages regarding these issues because i was worried that the messages might be taken as unwarranted criticism, especially if a nominator had no hand in drafting the blurb. i think having the messages in a centralized location makes it more clear that we are just trying to improve the blurbs, rather than trying to point fingers at anyone. (this is also why i use the link text "nominator" for the pings.) i believe centralizing these discussions may also put less pressure on fac nominators who do not wish to respond or deal with the blurb, as the comments are no longer directed specifically at them. in addition, i had previously felt that i had the implicit responsibility of bring up serious unresolved issues at wp:errors, and am glad that this seems to be no longer the case, since i am now assuming that a tfa coordinator will address any issues that need to be addressed. adding a small tick to help keep track of things is fine by me. i can't imagine a situation where i'd remove a tick, but if i ever end up having a follow-up question, i'd probably add it below the tick, to make it more clear that i had an additional concern. No, no; I am an old fart with concentration issues. If you add a comment to a section I have ticked, please remove the tick, you will be doing me a favour. Gog the Mild (talk) 23:09, 26 October 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] oh, i see what you mean now! for some reason, i had misunderstood the location of the ticks, thinking that you meant that you would add them in a comment, as is often done at wp:errors, even though your description was perfectly clear. in that case, if there's a tick for a section that i'm about to add a comment to, i'll remove it. thanks for letting me know! by the way, whenever i've promoted sets at dyk, i've generally adopted the practice of striking the section heading if i feel that the issues i've raised for a specific hook have been resolved. see, for example, here. (it's not my idea; i think i adopted it from RoySmith.) i thought i might offer it as another option in case you'd find it useful. dying (talk) 23:59, 26 October 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] I'd hate to think that how I do things at DYK is being held up anywhere as an example of best practice for anything :-) RoySmith (talk) 02:57, 27 October 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Perish the thought. We at TFA can surely find our own, novel, ways of fouling things up. Gog the Mild (talk) 21:16, 29 October 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Gog, i just wanted to let you know that i think i will refrain from removing ticks when i am adding comments to a section that has already been resolved and i don't think it is necessary to flag the additional comments for your attention. this way, it will hopefully be more clear that i also consider the issues resolved. for example, with this edit, i am also adding comments to the "smoking on my ex pack" section below, but i am not removing the tick because i have no issues with the current blurb. if you'd prefer that i continue to remove the tick in such cases, please let me know. thanks! dying (talk) 05:59, 7 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] dying (talk) 22:59, 26 October 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] That makes perfect sense to me. The tick is to indicate "no further attention needed", so I agree with you.
