The official languages of the OIC are Arabic, English, and French. It maintains various affiliated, specialized, and subsidiary organs within the framework of OIC Charter. The member states had a collective population of over 1.8 billion as of 2015,[1] accounting for just under a quarter of the world's population. The collective area is 31.66 m km2.[3] History On 21 August 1969, a fire was started in the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. Amin al-Husseini, the former Mufti of Jerusalem, called the arson a "Jewish crime" and called for all Muslim heads of state to convene a summit.[4] The fire, which "destroyed part of the old wooden roof and an 800-year-old pulpit"[5] was blamed on the mental illness of the perpetrator—Australian Christian fundamentalist Denis Michael Rohan—by Israel, and on Zionists and Zionism in general by the Islamic conference.[6] On 25 September 1969, an Islamic Conference, a summit of representatives of 24 Muslim majority countries (most of the representatives being heads of state), was held in Rabat, Morocco.[4][2] A resolution was passed stating that Muslim governments would consult with a view to promoting among themselves close cooperation and mutual assistance in the economic, scientific, cultural and spiritual fields, inspired by the immortal teachings of Islam.[4] Six months later in March 1970, the First Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers was held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.[6] In 1972, the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC, now the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation) was founded.[7] While the al-Aqsa fire is regarded as one of the catalysts for the formation of the OIC, many Muslims have aspired to a pan-Islamic institution that would serve the common political, economic, and social interests of the ummah (Muslim community) since the 19th century. In particular, the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the Caliphate after World War I left a vacuum.[citation needed] According to its charter, the OIC aims to preserve Islamic social and economic values; promote solidarity amongst member states; increase cooperation in social, economic, cultural, scientific, and political areas; uphold international peace and security; and advance education, particularly in the fields of science and technology.[2] The emblem of the OIC contains three main elements that reflect its vision and mission as incorporated in its new Charter. These elements are: the Kaaba, the Globe, and the Crescent.[citation needed] On 5 August 1990, 45 foreign ministers of the OIC adopted the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam to serve as a guidance for the member states in the matters of human rights in as much as they are compatible with the Sharia, or Quranic Law.[8] In March 2008, the OIC conducted a formal revision of its charter. The revised charter set out to promote human rights, fundamental freedoms, and good governance in all member states. The revisions also removed any mention of the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam. Within the revised charter, the OIC has chosen to support the Charter of the United Nations and international law, without mentioning the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.[9] On 28 June 2011, during the 38th Council of Foreign Ministers meeting (CFM) in Astana, Kazakhstan, the organisation changed its name from Organisation of the Islamic Conference (Arabic: منظمة المؤتمر الإسلامي; French: Organisation de la Conférence Islamique) to its current name.[10] The OIC also changed its logo at this time.[citation needed] Refugees According to the UNHCR, OIC countries hosted 18 million refugees by the end of 2010. Since then OIC members have absorbed refugees from other conflicts, including the uprising in Syria. In May 2012, the OIC addressed these concerns at the "Refugees in the Muslim World" conference in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan.[11] Member states Main article: Member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation A clickable Euler diagram showing the relationships between various multinational organisations within the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (note that Syria is currently suspended from all organizations affiliated with the OIC due to human rights abuses in the ongoing Syrian civil war).v • d • e The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation has 57 members, 56 of which are also member states of the United Nations, the exception being Palestine. Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Central African Republic, Thailand, Russia, and Northern Cyprus (under the name "Turkish Cypriot State") are observer states, and other organisations and groups also participate as observers.[12] Africa Algeria Benin Burkina Faso Cameroon Chad Comoros Djibouti Egypt Gabon Gambia Guinea Guinea-Bissau Ivory Coast Libya Mali Mauritania Morocco Mozambique Niger Nigeria Senegal Sierra Leone Somalia Sudan Togo Tunisia Uganda Asia / Afghanistan Azerbaijan Bahrain Bangladesh Brunei Indonesia Iran Iraq Jordan Kazakhstan Kuwait Kyrgyzstan Lebanon Malaysia Maldives Oman Pakistan Palestine Qatar Saudi Arabia Syria (Suspended)[13] Tajikistan Turkey Turkmenistan United Arab Emirates Uzbekistan Yemen Europe Albania Americas Guyana Suriname Positions The Parliamentary Union of the OIC Member States (PUOICM) was established in Iran in 1999, and its head office is situated in Tehran. Only OIC members are entitled to membership in the union.[14] On 27 June 2007, then-United States President George W. Bush announced that the United States would establish an envoy to the OIC. Bush said of the envoy, "Our special envoy will listen to and learn from representatives from Muslim states, and will share with them America's views and values."[15] As of June 2015[update], Arsalan Suleman is acting special envoy. He was appointed on 13 February 2015.[16] In an investigation of the accuracy of a series of chain emails, Snopes.com reported that during the October 2003 – April 2004 session of the General Assembly, 17 individual members of the OIC voted against the United States 88% of the time.[17] The OIC, on 28 March 2008, joined the criticism of the film Fitna by Dutch lawmaker Geert Wilders, which features disturbing images of violent acts juxtaposed with alleged verses from the Quran.[18] In March 2015, the OIC announced its support for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen against the Shia Houthis.[19] Israeli–Palestinian conflict The OIC supports a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.[20] The OIC has called for boycott of Israeli products in effort to pressure Israel into ending the occupation of the Palestinian territories.[21][22] There was a meeting in Conakry, Guinea, in 2013. Secretary-General Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu said that foreign ministers would discuss the possibility of cutting ties with any state that recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel or that moves its embassy to its environs.[23] In December 2017, the extraordinary meeting held to response Donald Trump's decision on recognizing Jerusalem, resulting "Istanbul Declaration on Freedom for Al Quds."[24] In September 2019, the OIC condemned Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to annex the eastern portion of the occupied West Bank known as the Jordan Valley.[25] Relationship with India Further information: Islam in India Islam is the second-largest religion in India after Hinduism, with over 200 million Muslims making up approximately 15% of the country's total population;[26][27] India has the largest Muslim population outside of Muslim-majority or Islamic states. However, India's relationship with Pakistan, the latter being an Islamic state, has been riddled with hostilities and armed conflict since the 1947 Partition of India. The poor relationship between the two states has had a direct impact on India–OIC relations due to Pakistan's status as a founding member of the organization. India has pushed for the OIC to accept it as a member state, arguing that Indian Muslims comprise 11% of the world's total Muslim population; Pakistan has staunchly opposed the entry of India into the organization.[28][29][30] Pakistan has cited its conflict with India over the Kashmir region as the reason for its opposition, and frequently accuses India of perpetrating widespread human rights abuses against Kashmiris in the Indian-administered territory of Jammu and Kashmir, which has wi contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 69 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation responseCode 3 200
