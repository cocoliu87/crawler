The stadium is situated on the outskirts of city limit of Pune in Gahunje village near Mumbai–Pune Expressway.[9] It is one of the premier stadiums of the country. Before its existence, Nehru Stadium of downtown Pune was the home ground of the Maharashtra Cricket team and venue for international matches organised by MCA.[10] MCA stadium was designed by Michael Hopkins of Hopkins architects. Its seating capacity is 42,700.[3] Arena's shape is like a deep bowl.[11][12] The venue hosted its first ever international match in December 2012.[13] Its ground's shape is round, with Bermuda grass surface. The ground has high-tech pop-up sprinklers.[14] Its final phase of construction is still yet to be completed.[12] The stadium's 75% seating area still does not have a roof.[15] It has floodlights to organise games at night.[13] On 1 April 2012, then ICC president Sharad Pawar inaugurated the MCA stadium.[2][16][17] The arena hosed its first ever first class match in December 2011, when Himachal Pradesh played against home side Maharashtra cricket team in 2011-12 Ranji trophy edition, hosted first IPL game (Pune Warriors v King's XI Punjab) in April 2012. MCA stadium hosted its first ever T20I match in December 2012 (between India-England) and first ever Test in February 2017.[17][18] The arena is set to host 5 games of 2023 ICC World Cup including the India - Bangladesh game.[19] History[edit] Background[edit] Outside view of this arena at night The MCA's decision to build a new Cricket stadium in Pune stemmed from a dispute with the Pune Municipal Corporation,[citation needed] regarding ticket allocations for Nehru Stadium. This conflict came to a head when an international match between India and Sri Lanka was moved to Kolkata, with the MCA stating they were in no position to host the match. Following this, the MCA decided a new stadium was needed.[citation needed] Construction[edit] The groundbreaking ceremony was performed on the construction site on 21 October 2007 by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Sharad Pawar. MCA granted the contract to construct the first phase of the construction to Shapoorji Pallonji & Co. Ltd in November 2009. The construction work started on 14 November 2007.[20] The stadium is designed by British architect Sir Michael Hopkins of Hopkins Architects, who also credited to designed Lord's mount stand and Ages bowl stadium of Southampton, England. The project's original deadline was November 2010 with cost of ₹ 1.50 billion, covering an area of 35 acres (140,000 m2). The construction of the stadium was held from 2010 to 2012, it faced various problems before complition in December 2011. Although it's claimed that major part of the stadium is built, the final phase of the construction is still yet to complete, 75% stands do not have roof and final phase of building is yet to started as of September 2023.[10][19] Maharashtra Cricket Association intended to host matches of 2011 World Cup, due to construction delayed, it was not able to do that.[14][19] The stadium and the seating arrangement were designed in such a way that an unobstructed view is assured from each location.The most important feature of this stadium is its rainwater drainage system. Often, matches are abandoned due to heavy downpour to overcome this problem, MCA opted for a sand-based outfield developed departmentally with technical assistance from STRI Limited, UK. Due to this technology, even during heavy showers, water on the outfield drains out fast, making it ready for play again just in few minutes.Zeolite supplied by G M Chemicals are used for Turf management.[21] It was inaugurated in a ceremony by the then ICC President and nation's Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar on 1 April 2012. Maharashtra's chief minister Prithviraj Chavan, deputy CM Ajit Pawar was invited.[22][18] In 2013, the Indian company Sahara India Pariwar bought the naming rights of the stadium, by virtue it was renamed as "Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium”. However, the name was changed back to the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium because Sahara paid only a part of the ₹ 200 crore that it had promised when acquiring the rights.[23] Began hosting games[edit] Before official inauguration, the stadium hosted a Ranji trophy match between Himachal Pradesh- Maharashtra on 21 December 2011 and some practice games.[10] In November 2015, the stadium was selected as the new Test venue of the country.[24] It hosted its first ever Test match in February 2017, it was the 1st match of the four match series, Steve Smith became first batter to score a test century in the stadium, Steve O'Keefe took six wickets in each inning, Australia won by 333 runs. [25] In 2010s, it served as the home ground for Pune Warriors India, Rising Pune Supergiant and Chennai Super Kings in different time.[citation needed] In 2015 IPL, Punjab Kings decided to move out of Mohali due to lukewarm spectator response at their primary home ground. Following the decision three home games were played at Pune. In 2018 IPL, due to members of some political parties protested outside the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai, political parties of Chennai demanded the IPL matches to be moved out of the city until the Cauvery Management Board[clarification needed] was set up as directed by the honourable Supreme Court of India. Additionally Chennai police expressed that they are unable to provide stadium sequrity. Chennai Super Kings relocated its remaining games to MCA stadium. [26] On 28 March 2021, MCA hosted its 50th game.[10] Controversy[edit] In 2017, Indian TV network India Today exposed this stadium's official pitch curator Salgaonkar in a sting operation. The network alleged Salgaonkar for malpractice before India vs New Zealand ODI match of New Zealand tour of India. In response to that Mahrashtra Cricket Association sacked Salgaonkar from the job. According to 'cricket.com.au', the pitch curator showed batting pitch to the men around the Pune, which is clear breach of the ICC rule governing access to the Cricket pitch in international cricket matches.[27] The second ODI went ahead on schedule after the pitch had been inspected by match referee Chris Broad. The India Today footage of Salgaonkar speaking with a reporter, who was posing as a bookmaker, was broadcast a few hours before the match.[28] India Today alleged that Salgaonkar shared information about the wicket to their undercover reporter about possible scores and Salgaonkar was ready to tamper wicket for bounce. As per India Today their undercover reporter accompanied by Salgaonkar was permitted to tap, walk, and stamp on the pitch. The curator guaranteed to doctor the pitch according to demand.[29] Salgaonkar was suspended for 6 months from the curator position by BCCI and ICC, after that he returned on the job at MCA as curator.[30] In 2017, the pitch used for the first test of India vs Australia series was rated poor by ICC match referee Chris Broad in his match report.[31] In 2018 Bombay High court restricted Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) from using Pavana river water for the maintenance of this stadium's ground. The court gave this verdict in response to a Public interest litigation field by a NGO, Loksatta movement. Maharashtra government granted the permission to use the water of Pavana river for industrial purpose to MCA. The judges of Bombay High court said that, "We are shocked to note that for a period of six years, the state government has allowed the MCA to draw water from the Pavana river for industrial purposes when admittedly the MCA is not running any industry. The water is being used for the stadium” and to do so was illegal.[32] Domestic cricket[edit] View from pavellion end.
