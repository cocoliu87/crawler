There are simplified versions of this page at Help:Introduction to images with Wiki Markup and Help:Introduction to images with VisualEditor. This tutorial explains how to insert pictures into Wikipedia articles using wikitext. This is one of the most frequently asked questions. It describes options for specifying placement, alt text, captions, sizes and links, and contains advice about panoramas and avoiding image stackups. There is also a technical document describing the syntax and a simple guide for beginners. The same syntax is used regardless of whether a file is from Wikipedia or Wikimedia Commons. If you need help uploading an image, or selecting a suitable image for an article, see the image use policy and the Manual of Style. Images on most websites are copyrighted and should not be uploaded; see the copyright policy. Please upload the highest resolution image possible, but keep the file size under 1,000 megabytes. Before you add an image to an article, view the image's image description page to make sure its copyright status is clearly stated, preferably with one of the image copyright tags.

For guidance on the syntax for doing this, see Help:Infobox picture. In very brief summary, one hurdle that trips up many people when attempting to add an image to an infobox template is that most internally provide the wiki code that "wraps" the image. Accordingly, you do not usually add the brackets, number of pixels, and other code details you will learn about below, when placing an image in infoboxes â€“ just the file name next to a field labeled | image =. Adding such extraneous code will cause many infoboxes to break. Also, be aware that some infoboxes require that the file's name be placed without the file/image namespace prefix. Thus, and for example, if File:Name.jpg does not work, try just Name.jpg. Thumbnails Instructions on this page may not work with VisualEditor. If you have opted in, you can use either VisualEditor or classic editing through wiki markup (wikitext) to edit most pages. The directions on this page, especially about what codes to type to produce formatting effects, are predominantly geared toward wikitext editing. For instructions on editing with VisualEditor, see Wikipedia:VisualEditor/User guide. An existing English Wikipedia or Wikimedia Commons image can be inserted into a page with the basic wikitext [[File:...|thumb|Caption text]]
 . (Image: can be substituted for File: with no change in effect; the choice between the two is purely a matter of editorial preference.) Using thumb generates a thumbnail picture, typically sized differently from the original image. For guidance on the caption text to associate with images, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Captions. Several options can affect a thumbnail's placement and size, described below. On the left By default a thumbnail is floated to the right of the page, with the text flowing around it. However, our first example specifies left. Just below the example you can see what the resulting picture looks like: [[File:Wikipedesketch.png|thumb|left|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Myriapoda]]''.]]
 The Wikipede edits Myriapoda. The above text gives the image file name "Wikipedesketch.png", the image type "thumb" and alignment "left", the alt text "A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.", and the caption "The Wikipede edits Myriapoda." A Wikipedia reader can click on the thumbnail, or on the small double-rectangle icon below it, to see the corresponding file page which will let the user see the image in its original size. Although the above text may appear in multiple lines for formatting purposes, the actual image text is on one line, as it uses spaces without any line breaks. The [[ and the first | must be on the same line; other spaces and line breaks are ignored if they are next to | characters or just inside the brackets. Some parts of the image syntax, such as the alt=, do not allow spaces or line breaks, and the easiest way to get it right is to omit unnecessary spaces and line breaks. Alt text is intended for visually impaired readers. Often the caption or article will describe the image adequately, and where this is the case you can write alt=caption or alt=see adjacent text. If additional alt text is added, it should be a succinct description that complies with the content policies; see WP:ALT for more information. Unlike alt text, a caption can contain Wiki markup like ''[[Myriapoda]]''. The caption text is placed underneath the picture. Here is the same example again, this time in the context of some colored lorem ipsum dummy text with asterisks (*) showing where the image syntax appears in the text: [[File:Wikipedesketch.png|thumb|left|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Myriapoda]]''.]]

Avoid referring to images as being "on the left". Image placement is different for viewers of the mobile version of Wikipedia, and is meaningless to people having pages read to them by assistive software. Instead, use captions to identify images. On the right The default placement for a thumbnail is on the right: [[File:Wikipedesketch.png|thumb|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Myriapoda]]''.]]
