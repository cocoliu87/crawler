This lesson is specifically about how to use Wikipedia to learn about Wikipedia. Here we will point out all the resources dedicated to help you help Wikipedia. This isn't just for beginners; below we cover how to learn in general, which can be applied to any particular skill or area of activity on Wikipedia. For the article on how and where you can help see contributing to Wikipedia. Learn your way around:[edit] Here's a quick overview of Wikipedia's structure: To access an encyclopedia article directly, type the topic or subject into Wikipedia's search box, and click "Go". If an article by that name exists, it will be displayed on your screen. If an article with that exact name doesn't exist, the program will automatically look for near matches (in the titles and content of pages) and display the matches it finds in a list for you to choose from. If you pressed "Go", and got an article you weren't looking for, press "Search" - that'll bypass the viewing and will execute the match search just described. For instructions on how to access other page types besides encyclopedia articles, see the section immediately below. By namespace[edit] Wikipedia can be considered to be two levels deep. The top level is the encyclopedia itself (the collection of articles about every subject under the sun, and beyond), and it is therefore the easiest to access - simply enter the name of the article you wish to view in Wikipedia's searchbox. The section of Wikipedia that the articles are on is called the "main namespace". It is Wikipedia's default namespace - pages from all other namespaces must have their namespace specified in searches or links (followed by a colon). But not articles in the main namespace. Because they're the whole point of Wikipedia. All of Wikipedia's namespaces other than the main namespace can be considered Wikipedia's 2nd level. For a list and explanation of these, see Help:Namespace. By link structure[edit] Almost every page on Wikipedia is connected within a massive web of links. Some pages are more centrally connected than others and serve as tables of contents or directories to the information on Wikipedia. These pages are presented in Wikipedia's 3 main navigation bars, found at the top of the very same pages, the navbars allowing for easy movement between and browsing of these pages. Each of these navbars is just one-click away... The following navbar presents the tables of contents to the encyclopedia itself, and is accessible from the Contents link on the sidebar, or from the top of the Main Page. Overviews Outlines Lists Portals Glossaries Categories Vital articles Featured content Good articles Indices Aâ€“Z index The next navbar shows the Wikipedia community's main directories and resource pages, and it is accessible from the Community Portal link in Wikipedia's navigation menu (in the sidebar). Note that policies and guidelines are listed on the shortcuts directory.

Other major link structures[edit] When looking for subjects relevant to any particular page you are viewing, be sure to check the page's "See also" section (if it has one), and also the "What links here" command in the toolbar menu on the sidebar on the left-side of your screen (the location of this command on the page varies if you have selected a skin in "my preferences").

Wikipedia:Village pump (technical)/Archive - like the help desk, but the questions and advice are far more complex, tricky, or expert-level. If you read a few thousand of these questions and their answers, you'll be a Wikipedia expert (or well on your way). Learn by asking[edit] If you can't figure something out or are having trouble finding what you need to know, ask. Keep in mind that most questions that have been asked before, and their answers, are immediately accessible. See Pre-answered questions, above.
