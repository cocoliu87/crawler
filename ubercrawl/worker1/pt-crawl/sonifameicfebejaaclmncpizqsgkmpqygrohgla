The tournament was hosted between 30 May and 14 July across 10 venues in England and a single venue in Wales. It was the fifth time that England had hosted the World Cup, while for Wales it was their third. The tournament was contested by 10 teams, a decrease from 14 teams in the previous edition, with the format of the tournament changing to a single round-robin group with the top four teams qualifying through to the knockout stage. After six weeks of round-robin matches, which saw four games not have a result, India, Australia, England, and New Zealand finished as the top four, with Pakistan missing out on net run rate. In the knockout stage, England and New Zealand won their respective semi-finals to qualify for the final, which was played at Lord's in London. The final ended in a tie after the match ended with both teams scoring 241 runs, followed by the first Super Over in an ODI; England won the title, their first, on the boundary countback rule after the Super Over also finished level. The total attendance throughout the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup was 752,000.[1] Overall, videos of the group stages amassed over 2.6 billion views from around the world, making it the most-watched cricket competition as of 2019.[update][2] Hosting[edit] The hosting rights were awarded in April 2006, after England and Wales withdrew their bid to host the 2015 Cricket World Cup, which was played in Australia and New Zealand. It was the fifth Cricket World Cup played in England, following the 1975, 1979, 1983 and 1999 World Cups. Wales also hosted matches at the 1983 and 1999 tournaments, the latter also seeing matches played in Scotland, Ireland and the Netherlands.[3][4] Qualification[edit] Highlighted are the countries that participated in the 2019 Cricket World Cup. Qualified as host Qualified via the ICC ODI Championship ranking Qualified via the 2018 qualifier Participated in the qualifier but failed to qualify Main article: 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier The 2019 World Cup featured 10 teams, a decrease from previous World Cups in 2011 and 2015, which each featured 14 teams.[5] The hosts (England) and the top seven other teams in the ICC One Day International rankings on 30 September 2017 earned an automatic qualification.[6] Results from 19 September 2017 confirmed that these teams were Australia, Bangladesh, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa and Sri Lanka.[7] The remaining two spots were decided by the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier.[6] At the time of the announcement of the qualification structure, ICC Associate and Affiliate Members, who were guaranteed four spots in the previous two World Cup tournaments, could now only be represented by at most two teams, and possibly none at all if they were beaten by the lowest-ranked Full Members in the Qualifier.[6] It also meant that at least two of the ten Test-playing nations at the time of the announcement would have to play in the qualifying tournament, and could miss the World Cup finals entirely. Thus, this was the first World Cup to be contested without all of the Full Member nations being present.[8] The final stage of the tournament was a "Super Six" group, from which the top two teams qualified for the 2019 World Cup. The West Indies were guaranteed a spot after defeating Scotland in the penultimate round.[9] Afghanistan joined them after defeating Ireland in the final over of their match.[10] This was the first time since 1983 that Zimbabwe had failed to qualify for a World Cup.[11] Ireland also missed the competition for the first time since 2007,[12] and, for the first time, no Associate nation participated.[13] Means of qualification Date Venue Berths Qualified[14] Host nation 30 September 2006[15] — 1 England ICC ODI Championship 30 September 2017 Various 7 Australia Bangladesh India New Zealand Pakistan South Africa Sri Lanka 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier 23 March 2018 Zimbabwe 2 Afghanistan West Indies Total 10 Venues[edit] The fixture list for the tournament was released on 26 April 2018 after the completion of an ICC meeting in Kolkata, India. London Stadium had been named as a possible venue in the planning stages,[16][17] and in January 2017, the ICC completed an inspection of the ground, confirming that the pitch dimensions would be compliant with the requirements to host ODI matches.[18] However, when the fixtures were announced, London Stadium was not included as a venue.[19][20] All of the venues used are in England except for Sophia Gardens, which is in Wales. The final was scheduled for 14 July 2019 at Lord's in London.[21] Birmingham Bristol Cardiff Chester-le-Street Edgbaston Bristol County Ground Sophia Gardens Riverside Ground Capacity: 25,000[20] Capacity: 17,500[20] Capacity: 15,643[20] Capacity: 17,000[20] Matches: 5 (including semi-final) Matches: 3 Matches: 4 Matches: 3 Leeds London Birmingham Bristol Cardiff Chester-le-Street Leeds Nottingham Manchester Lord's The Oval Southampton Taunton class=notpageimage| Venues in England and Wales Headingley Lord's The Oval Capacity: 18,350[20] Capacity: 30,000[20] Capacity: 25,500[22] Matches: 4 Matches: 5 (including final) Matches: 5 Manchester Nottingham Southampton Taunton Old Trafford Trent Bridge Rose Bowl County Ground Capacity: 26,000[20] Capacity: 17,500[20] Capacity: 25,000[20] Capacity: 12,500[20] Matches: 6 (including semi-final) Matches: 5 Matches: 5 Matches: 3 Squads[edit] Main article: 2019 Cricket World Cup squads All the participating teams had to submit the names of their respective World Cup squads by 23 April 2019.[23] The teams were allowed to change players in their 15-man squad anytime up to seven days before the start of the tournament.[24] New Zealand was the first team to announce their World Cup squad.[25] The oldest player of the tournament was South African player Imran Tahir, who was 40 years old, while the youngest was Afghan spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman, who was 18.[26][27] Match officials[edit] Main article: 2019 Cricket World Cup officials In April 2019, the ICC named the officials for the tournament, 16 umpires and six match referees.[28] Ian Gould announced that he would retire as an umpire following the conclusion of the tournament.[29] Prize money[edit] The International Cricket Council declared a total prize money pool of US$10 million for the tournament, the same as the 2015 edition.[30] England, the winning team, received US$4,000,000, the runner-up $2,000,000 and the losing semi-finalists $800,000. Teams that did not progress past the league stage received $100,000 and the winner of each league stage match received $40,000.[31] Warm-up matches[edit] Before the World Cup, the participating nations competed in 10 warm-up matches, which were played from 24 to 28 May 2019. These matches did not have either One Day International (ODI) status or List A status as teams were allowed to field all 15 members of their squad.[32][33][A] Warm-up matches 24 May 2019 10:30 Scorecard Pakistan 262 (47.5 overs) v Afghanistan 263/7 (49.4 overs) Babar Azam 112 (108) Mohammad Nabi 3/46 (10 overs) Hashmatullah Shahidi 74* (102) Wahab Riaz 3/46 (7.4 overs) Afghanistan won by 3 wickets Bristol County Ground, Bristol Umpires: Michael Gough (Eng) and Rod Tucker (Aus) Pakistan won the toss and elected to bat. 24 May 2019 10:30 Scorecard South Africa 338/7 (50 overs) v Sri Lanka 251 (42.3 overs) Faf du Plessis 88 (69) Suranga Lakmal 2/63 (9 overs) Dimuth Karunaratne 87 (92) Andile Phehlukwayo 4/36 (7 overs) South Africa won by 87 runs Sophia Gardens, Cardiff Umpires: Richard Illingworth (Eng) and Paul Wilson (Aus) Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to field. 25 May 2019 10:30 Scorecard Australia 297/9 (50 overs) v England 285 (49.3 overs) Steve Smith 116 (102) Liam Plunkett 4/69 (9 overs) James Vince 64 (76) Jason Behrendorff 2/43 (8 overs) Australia won by 12 runs Rose Bowl, Southampton Umpires: Marais Erasmus (SA) and Sundaram Ravi (Ind) England won the toss and elected to field. 25 May 2019 10:30 Scorecard India 179 (39.2 overs) v New Zealand 180/4 (37.1 overs) Ravindra Jadeja 54 (50) Trent Boult 4/33 (6.2 overs) Ross Taylor 71 (75) Jasprit Bumrah 1/2 (4 overs) New Zealand won by 6 wickets The Oval, London Umpires: Kumar Dharmasena (SL) and Bruce Oxenford (Aus) India won the toss and elected to bat. 26 May 2019 10:30 Scorecard South Africa 95/0 (12.4 overs) v West Indies Hashim Amla 51* (46) No result Bristol County Ground, Bristol Umpires: Aleem Dar (Pak) and Rod Tucker (Aus) West Indies won the toss and elected to field.
