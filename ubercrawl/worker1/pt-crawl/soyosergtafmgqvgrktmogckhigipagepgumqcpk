By May 12, 2021, the Australian Faunal Directory has collected information about 126,442 species and subspecies.[2] It includes the data from the discontinued Zoological Catalogue of Australia[3] and is regularly updated.[4] Started in the 1980s, it set a goal to compile a "list of all Australian fauna including terrestrial vertebrates, ants and marine fauna" and create an "Australian biotaxonomic information system".[5] This important electronic key and educative package enables faster and orderly identification of Australian centipede species .
