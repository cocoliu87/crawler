The first battle occurred between 15 and 20 April 2023, during which hundreds were reported dead.[8] A civilian-brokered ceasefire paused the fighting by April 20. Sporadic clashes broke out between May and July. In August 2023, the RSF launched an offensive on the city.[9] The SAF launched air campaigns against the RSF in Nyala, with many civilian casualties in Taiba and El Matar. In late September, the RSF besieged the headquarters the SAF's 16th Infantry Division headquarters, capturing it on October 26. Prelude[edit] In the early hours of the morning of 15 April 2023, soldiers loyal to the Rapid Support Forces started a series of assaults on key buildings in Khartoum, primarily the Khartoum International Airport. While the international airport was captured by the RSF, street battles continued throughout Khartoum and the neighboring cities of Omdurman and Bahri.[10][11] The RSF also captured the presidential palace, the residence of the former Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir, and attacked a military base.[12][13] Users on Facebook Live and Twitter documented the Sudanese Air Force flying above the city, and striking the RSF targets.[14] Origin in Darfur[edit] The history of conflicts in Sudan has consisted of foreign invasions and resistance, ethnic tensions, religious disputes, and competition over resources.[15][16] In its modern history, two civil wars between the central government and the southern regions killed 1.5 million people, and a continuing conflict in the western region of Darfur has displaced two million people and killed more than 200,000 people.[17] Since independence in 1956, Sudan has had more than fifteen military coups[18] and it has also been ruled by the military for the majority of the republic's existence, with only brief periods of democratic civilian parliamentary rule.[19] Before the War[edit] Nyala was one of the largest refugee havens in Darfur during the War in Darfur, and was also greatly targeted by warring armies. This has caused Nyala to be a city with an excessive amount of wars and battles between the last few decades. Timeline[edit] First Battle of Nyala (April 15–20)[edit] Conflict began early in the morning of April 15.[20] Due to the outbreak of fighting, all markets and schools in Nyala were closed, and civilians were urged to stay in their homes.[21] The Nyala hospital stated that six civilians were killed early on in the clashes.[22] Most clashes took place inside the city, and an attack on the al-Malja market killed three people.[23] The SAF also claimed to repel an attack by RSF on Nyala International Airport and the Sudanese army regional command bases next to it.[23] At least eleven people were killed in Nyala and Khartoum, and over sixteen injured, in Nyala on the first day of fighting.[24] Other local monitors claimed 22 people were killed on just the first day.[25] By April 16, Nyala recorded the most fatalities in the fighting, and clashes took place at the SAF bases and near the Nyala hospital.[26] The RSF took control of the Nyala Airport on April 16, after a 90-minute long attack pushed Sudanese forces to the eastern neighborhoods of the city.[27] In battles in Kabkabiya, three World Food Programme aid workers were killed, prompting the organization to suspend all activities in Darfur, including Nyala.[28] Little was known about the continued attacks on April 16 or the civilian death toll, due to fog of war.[29][30] Several UN agency offices were looted in Nyala by the RSF, including the WFP, UNHCR, and UNICEF.[31] Médecins Sans Frontières reported that they could no longer conduct relief activities in the city, as their offices in Nyala had been looted.[32] The RSF also captured the South Darfur Ministry of Finance that day, and clashes between army forces and the RSF in the neighborhoods of El Wadi, El Geer, and El Sereif caused civilians to flee.[33] The El-Salam refugee camp, adjacent to Nyala, was also cut off from supplies due to the fighting. The RSF also consolidated control over the headquarters of the Sudanese Army's 7th Regiment.[34] By April 18, fighting had simmered down partially, and unknown gunmen on rickshaws allegedly affiliated with the RSF patrolled the city, ransacking NGOs and looting businesses.[33] Theft took place at the Nyala Crops Exchange and police headquarters, in the industrial zone of the city.[35] In the evening of April 18, the Nyala Central Hospital ceased operations due to a lack of power.[36] Injured patients were brought to the Nyala Teaching Hospital and the Sudanese-Turkish hospital, the other two operating hospitals in the city. Other medical associations, including MSF, halted operations due to an inability to reach civilians through the fighting.[37] Most fighting continued to take place near Nyala International Airport and the Sudanese Army's 16th Division command next to it.[38] Further reports of the RSF-aligned gunmen emerged in Nyala on April 19, as violence settled further.[39] Around this time, the Sudanese Army controlled the 16th Division's military base, and the RSF controlled the airport, with a resident stating they "have 50-50 percent control of the area."[38] The day was relatively quiet in the city, although at night, protests by civilians occurred in neighborhoods against both the RSF and SAF.[40] On April 20, a civilian-brokered ceasefire halted fighting between the RSF and SAF.[41][42] The Nyala Central Hospital also began operations again, as electricity made its way back to the city.[43] Some fighting continued in the north of the city later in the day, and civilian barricades were not taken down.[41] By April 20, RSF forces were in El Matar, El Riyadh, and El Malja neighborhoods close to the airport.[41] The RSF were also in control of the South Darfur intelligence services and Nyala Police Headquarters, on the eastern side of the city.[44] The SAF were in control of many armories, ministries, and the army headquarters.[44] Ceasefire in effect (April 21–May 5)[edit] The ceasefire continued to hold through May. The Turkish hospital in Nyala announced that the area around the hospital had slowed down fighting and that most hospitals are able to return to work.[45] The Ministry of Education in the city was burned down on April 21, despite the truce.[42] Eight bodies were collected by civilians in the days following the battle in areas that were unable to reach due to fighting.[46] The market also returned, although prices were high. Meanwhile, inmates at the Nyala prison were released due to a lack of food and sufficient goods to hold them.[46] The provisional death toll of the battle saw over 60 civilians killed, and 279 injured.[42][41][44] Clashes broke out a second time in Nyala on May 6, after RSF militants attempted to loot warehouses in the SAF-controlled al-Nahba neighborhood.[44] The fighting then spread to two more neighborhoods. By May 7, Al Jazeera reported that Sudanese forces had pushed the RSF out of Nyala.[47] Afterwards, theft skyrocketed in the city, and many markets closed down.[48] Sporadic clashes (May 18–August 8)[edit] On May 15, 80 leaders of South Darfuri tribes signed a document urging the RSF and SAF to cease fighting.[49] However, clashes reignited on May 18 at the Nyala Central Bank after disgruntled RSF soldiers fought with SAF troops receiving their paychecks.[49] The day prior, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan's derecognition of the RSF prevented RSF soldiers from receiving government paychecks. On May 21, twenty-four girls, some as young as 14, were raped by RSF militants in the city's Aldaman hotel.[50] Some of the girls were able to escape.[50] In battles on May 19, RSF militants stormed and looted NGO offices, while civilians barricaded and dug ditches around their neighborhoods to prevent RSF attacks.[51] On May 20, the village of Abu Adam, near Nyala, was torched by alleged RSF militants, shown by satellite footage in late May. Numerous markets were also set ablaze in the city, with residents stating water pumps were out of service as well.[52] Clashes broke out in Nyala again on May 23, with 28 people killed between May 20 and May 23 in the city.[53] Several days later, more bodies were discovered in the Nyala market.[54] At the time, Nyala had a shaky internet connection due to RSF attacks on Sudatel towers on the outskirts of the city.[55] Local activists claimed 600,000 refugees were without aid in  contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 49 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Battle_of_Nyala responseCode 3 200
