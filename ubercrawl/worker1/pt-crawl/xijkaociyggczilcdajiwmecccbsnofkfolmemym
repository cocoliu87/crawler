He accused media affiliated with the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) of spreading lies to boost morale among RSF members. Al-Atta expressed gratitude to Saudi Arabia and the United States for mediating to end the conflict in Sudan but emphasized the army's goal of expelling rebel forces from Khartoum. He dismissed the possibility of the conflict turning into a civil war, asserting that the army represents all of Sudan's regions and tribes. Al-Atta also mentioned the presence of Wagner Group in the conflict and the issue of gold extraction in Sudan.[6] In July, al-Atta accused Kenyan President William Ruto of supporting the RSF, undermining his role in the East African peacekeeping mission. Sudan refuses to cooperate with the Quartet Group, led by Ruto, until he is replaced. al-Atta challenged Ruto to face the Sudanese army. Kenyan officials condemn these remarks.[1] In August, al-Atta stated that around 80% of the RSF have been incapacitated, continuing that the RSF continues to recruit inexperienced mercenaries, but the army repelled 6,000 new RSF fighters recently.[7] References[edit] ^ a b "Tension Between Sudan, Kenya's Ruto Impedes IGAD Mediation Effort in Sudan".
