This template is transcluded in one or more cascade-protected pages, so only administrators can edit it. This template is used on 415,000+ pages, or roughly 1% of all pages. To avoid major disruption and server load, any changes should be tested in the template's /sandbox or /testcases subpages, or in your own user subpage. The tested changes can be added to this page in a single edit. Consider discussing changes on the talk page before implementing them. This template uses Lua: Module:Citation/CS1 (sandbox) The Citation template generates a citation for a book, periodical, contribution in a collective work, or a web page. It determines the citation type by examining which parameters are used. As with other citation templates, this template can be used either in a footnote (between <ref>...</ref> tags) or in a section that lists sources. This template uses the same Lua code as citation style 1 (CS1) templates with parameters to change the displayed format to citation style 2 (CS2). If the correct parameters are used, this template produces output identical to that of the Cite templates, such as {{Cite book}} and {{Cite web}}, with one important exception: By default, this Citation template uses commas in places where the Cite templates use periods (full stops) by default; either type of template can use periods (full stops) or commas by using an optional parameter. Regardless of which citation templates are used or even if none are used at all, all citations should have the same format throughout an article in the saved, rendered text. Notes: All parameter names must be lowercase. Invisible unicode space characters (see list) will return an error message. Non-intentional invisible characters should be removed; intentional ones should be replaced with their corresponding HTML entity (e.g. &ZeroWidthSpace;). Simple citations This section covers the most commonly used parameters. You can copy the horizontal form or vertical form below and then add in extra parameters from the full list. Spacing and ordering of the parameters within the template is irrelevant and does not affect the final, rendered text. {{Citation |last= |first= |year= |title= |publisher= |publication-place= |page= |url= |access-date=}} {{Citation

}} last: The author's surname or last name. Don't use with the author parameter. first: The author's first or given name(s). year: Year of authorship or publication. Mandatory for use with links from Template:Harvard citation, unless |date= specifies both month and year. title: Title of the work. Mandatory for web references. publisher: The name of the publisher. Omit terms such as Publishers, Co., Inc., Ltd., etc., but retain the words Books or Press. Not normally included where the publication is a periodical which has its own Wikipedia article (e.g. Newsweek, Billboard). publication-place (or place or location): The city of publication. If more than one town/city is listed on the title page, give the first one or the location of the publisher's head office. Omit when the publication is a periodical whose name specifies the location (e.g. The New York Times, The Times of India) page: For use when one page is cited. Adds "p." before the page number. Do not use with pages. url: A url of an online location where the item can be found. If the url includes double quotes, these must be encoded as "%22". access-date: Date[n 1] when the url was accessed.

It includes deprecated parameters and does not include parameters that were added in the updates. These can be used for all types of publication. All are optional and indentation is used simply to group related items — these may be mutually exclusive where indicated. Some hyphenated names can also be placed without hyphens. {{Citation

 Parameters Syntax Nested parameters rely on their parent parameters: parent OR: parent2—may be used instead of parent child—may be used with parent (and is ignored if parent is not used) OR: child2—may be used instead of child (and is ignored if parent2 is not used) Where aliases are listed, only one of the parameters may be defined; if multiple aliased parameters are defined, then only one will show. By default, sets of fields are terminated with a comma (,). COinS This template embeds COinS metadata in the HTML output, allowing reference management software to retrieve bibliographic metadata. See Wikipedia:COinS. As a general rule, only one data item per parameter. Do not include explanatory or alternate text: use |date=27 September 2007 not |date=27 September 2007 (print version 25 September) Use of templates within the citation template is discouraged because many of these templates will add extraneous HTML or CSS that will be included raw in the metadata. Also, HTML entities, for example &nbsp;, &ndash;, etc., should not be used in parameters that contribute to the metadata. COinS metadata is created for these parameters Note: This table of metadata is displayed in the documentation of all Citation Style 1 templates. Not all of these parameters are supported by every CS1 template. Some of these parameters are mutually exclusive, some are aliases of another parameter, and some require other parameters to be present. A full list of this template's supported parameters, their aliases, and their dependencies is shown in the Usage section near the top of this documentation page. |periodical=, |journal=, |newspaper=, |magazine=, |work=, |website=, |encyclopedia=, |encyclopaedia=, |dictionary= |chapter=, |script-chapter=, |contribution=, |script-contribution=, |entry=, |script-entry=, |article=, |script-article=, |section=, |script-section= |title=, |script-title=, |book-title= |publication-place=, |place=, |location= |date=, |year=, |publication-date= |series=, |version= |volume=, |issue=, |number= |page=, |pages=, |at=, |quote-page=, |quote-pages= |edition= |publisher=, |institution= |url=, |chapter-url=, |contribution-url=, |section-url= |author-last=, |author-last#=, |author#-last=, |author-surname=, |author-surname#=, |author#-surname=, |last=, |last#=, |surname=, |surname#=, |author=, |author#=, |subject=, |subject#=, |host=, |host#= |author-first=, |author-first#=, |author#-first=, |author-given=, |author-given#=, |author#-given=, |first=, |first#=, |given=, |given#= |degree= |arxiv=, |bibcode=, |biorxiv=, |citeseerx=, |doi=, |eissn=, |eprint=, |hdl=, |isbn=, |issn=, |jfm=, |jstor=, |lccn=, |message-id=, |mr=, |oclc=, |osti=, |pmc=, |pmid=, |rfc=, |ssrn=, |s2cid=, |zbl= What's new What's new or changed recently Parameter Description Date |author-given= added aliases (including enumerated forms) for |author-first= October 2020 |author-surname= added aliases (including enumerated forms) for |author-last= October 2020 |display-subjects= added alias for |display-authors= for usage with |subject= October 2020 |interviewer-given= added aliases (including enumerated forms) for |interviewer-first= October 2020 |interviewer-surname= added aliases (including enumerated forms) for |interviewer-last= October 2020 |orig-date= added canonical form for alias |orig-year= October 2020 |quote-page= added single page specifier for |quote= October 2020 |quote-pages= added multiple pages specifier for |quote= October 2020 |sbn= added identifier parameter for Standard Book Numbers April 2020 |script-quote= added non-Latin script text facility for |quote= October 2020 |subject-mask= added aliases (including enumerated forms) to |author-mask= for usage with |subject= October 2020 |s2cid= added identifier parameter for Semantic Scholar corpus ID April 2020 |s2cid-access= added access-icon parameter for |s2cid= April 2020 |title-link= added special tokens none/doi/pmc to override/disable auto-linking ({{cite journal}} only) October 2020 |trans-quote= added translated text facility for |quote= October 2020 accept-this-as-written-markup added for |doi=, |eissn=, |isbn=, |issn=, |sbn= October 2020 Deprecated Deprecated CS1/CS2 parameters Deprecated parameter Replace with Date none deprecated at present Recently removed CS1/CS2 parameters Removed parameter Replace with Date Note |deadurl=yes |url-status=dead September 2019 Gets reinserted into contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 51 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Template:Citation responseCode 3 200
