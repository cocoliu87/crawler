K.a.c.e.a.c (talk) 04:56, 26 February 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] The sections are already really long. I think you can add Early 2022 into 2021 dry for sure. The reason they are split like this right now is because you see more fighting during the dry seasons. Also the civil war isn't based on the NUG declaration only. There are sources that talk about it starting in May or earlier of 2021. I intend to do some editing later today to try and cut down the size of the article. EmeraldRange (talk/contribs) 15:06, 26 February 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Draft:Battle of Mindat[edit] It's been noted that there are a lot of battle pages that are needed, but have yet to be made- I've started one for the Battle of Mindat. If anyone would like to help with it, that'd be appreciated. Presidentofyes12 (talk) 20:53, 26 June 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] War crime committed by the junta of the Myanmar civil war[edit] I think there should be a section on the war crimes committed by the junta Monochromemelo1 (talk) 16:26, 1 July 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Sure why not? Put it somewhere near the Humanitarian conditions section, Be WP:BOLD and also remember to keep a neutral point of view. EmeraldRange (talk/contribs) 17:45, 1 July 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Okay I'll start working on it later! Monochromemelo1 (talk) 21:34, 1 July 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Rohingya Resistance[edit] Where do the Rohingya Resistance Groups fit into this page despite the migrant crisis in Bangladesh because there are small Rohingya groups that are fighting the Junta. Koreanidentity10000 (talk) 22:11, 17 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Yes, like you said there are small Rohingya groups, like there are small Myaungmya groups or small [insert ethnic-minority] groups. Overall, not particularly mentioned in reliable sources. EmeraldRange (talk/contribs) 01:41, 18 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] So should the Rohingya resistance groups such as the ARSA and the RSO be included into the Allied ethnic armed organisations sections and the infobox? Koreanidentity10000 (talk) 01:41, 29 August 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] I don't see why they would not be included in the Allied ethnic armed section so long as we can source reliable sources to backup the existance of the groups and their alliances. Jurisdicta (talk) 03:48, 14 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Map[edit] Does anyone have any good sources on mapping for the conflict? I can't find anything River10000 (talk) 15:58, 6 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Unfortunately there are no easy mapping answers- it's kind of hard given the daily changes in control and lack of coverage. There's a few options: IISS heat map, a recently updated version of an unreliable 2022 map from twitter or this outdated 2022 township level map. Really the only feasible wikipedia option is for a wikipedian to map it but it's a lot of work and hard to verify given it is contested and controversial, requiring a lot of region-specific WP:RS to back up without engaging in WP:OR. EmeraldRange (talk/contribs) 17:18, 6 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Yeah. What a shame it's not mapped out by something fully like live-map; just goes to show that the civil war has really just gotten no coverage in western media despite how many lives it's affecting River10000 (talk) 15:21, 7 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] https://myanmar.iiss.org/ Doyna Yar (talk) 14:38, 17 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Proposed Rename: Myanmar civil war (2021–present) -> Myanmar civil war[edit] Is there any basis for the additional clarification of (2021-present)? We do not have any articles for other Myanmar civil wars. Dazzling4 (talk) 20:39, 14 November 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply] Internal conflict in Myanmar, of which this is only a renewed stage of conflict- especially true given that half of the fighting is with  contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 79 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Talk:Myanmar_civil_war_(2021%E2%80%93present) responseCode 3 200
