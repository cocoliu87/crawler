It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Singaporean telecommunications company Singtel. Optus is the second-largest wireless carrier in Australia, with over 10 million subscribers as of 2022, and its mobile network covers 98.5% of the Australian population.[2][3] History[edit] AUSSAT and deregulation (1981–1990)[edit] Optus can trace its beginnings back to the formation of the Government-owned AUSSAT Pty Limited in 1981. In 1982, Aussat selected the Hughes 376 for their initial satellites, with the first, AUSSAT A1, launched in August 1985.[4] AUSSAT satellites were used for both military and civilian satellite communications, and delivering television services to remote outback communities. See also: Optus fleet of satellites With Aussat operating at a loss and with moves to deregulate telecommunications in Australia, the government decided to sell Aussat, coupled with a telecommunications licence. The licence was sold to Optus Communications – a consortium including:[5] logistics firm Mayne Nickless (24.99%);[6] UK telecommunications company Cable & Wireless (24.50%); US telecommunications company BellSouth (24.50%); AIDC Limited (10.00%); insurance and investment company AMP (10.00%); and insurance and investment company National Mutual (6.02%). The new telecommunications company was designed to provide competition to then government owned telecommunications company Telecom Australia, now known as Telstra. Founding of Optus (1991–present)[edit] Original 1990s logo Optus gained the second general carrier licence in January 1991.[7] After privatisation, AUSSAT became Optus and its first offering to the general public was to offer long-distance calls at cheaper rates than that of its competitor Telstra. The long-distance calling rates on offer were initially available by consumers dialing 1 before the area code and phone number. Following this, a ballot process was conducted by then regulator AUSTEL, with customers choosing their default long-distance carrier.[8] Customers who made no choice or did not respond to the mailout campaign automatically remained as a Telstra long-distance customer. Customers who remained with Telstra could dial the override code of 1456 before the area code and phone number to manually select Optus as the carrier for that single call. Since 1 July 1998, consumers have the choice of preselecting their preferred long-distance carrier or dialling the override code before dialling a telephone number. The group began by building an interstate fibre optic cable and a series of exchanges between Optus' interstate network and Telstra's local network. It also laid fibre optics into major office buildings and industrial areas, and focused on high bandwidth local, (interstate) long distance, and interstate calls for business. In its early years, Optus was only able to offer local and long-distance calls to residential customers through Telstra's local phone network. Telstra would carry residential to residential calls to Optus' exchanges, and then the calls would be switched to Optus' long-distance fibre optic network. Optus was the main sponsor of the 1997 ARL season.[citation needed] Incidents[edit] 2022 cyberattack[edit] Main article: 2022 Optus data breach Around 22 September 2022, Optus systems sustained a significant cyberattack that resulted in a major data breach of both current and former customers' personal information, including customers’ names, dates of birth, phone numbers and email addresses, with a smaller subset of customers having their street addresses, driving licence details and passport numbers leaked. Optus CEO Kelly Bayer Rosmarin urged customers to exercise "heightened awareness" regarding transactions with their Optus and other accounts. Rosmarin emphasised that passwords were not compromised.[9][10] The CEO said that the "worst-case scenario" regarding the number of customers whose data had been leaked was 9.8 million customers, but believes the actual number to be far lower.[11] On 24 September 2022, Australian news outlets The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Optus was investigating the authenticity of a ransom demand of US$1 million made on a hacking forum. The demand gave Optus one week to pay the ransom in cryptocurrency else the data will be sold for US$300,000 to whoever else wants it.[12] On 6 October, the Australian Federal Police announced the arrest of a 19-year-old man who had allegedly threatened 93 Optus customers by saying that he would use their information leaked in the attack to commit financial crimes, unless they paid AUD $2,000.[13][14] In response to the cyberattack, the Australian federal government announced emergency regulation on 6 October, in the form of a 12-month amendment to the Telecommunications Regulations 2021 to "enable telecommunications companies to temporarily share approved government identifier information with regulated financial services entities."[15][16][17] On 11 October, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner launched an investigation, the aim of which is to explore the company's handling of customers' data.[18] 2023 nationwide outage[edit] Main article: 2023 Optus outage Early on 8 November 2023, an undetermined issue caused a nationwide outage in Optus Mobile and Fixed Internet services. The outage directly impacted more than 10 million customers, including government services, hospitals and businesses. Optus Mobile customers reported that their phones showed 'SOS' on the signal indicator, which is a sign the regular network is down, but mobile phones still have access to alternate networks in the event of an emergency call by using a so-called camping mechanism; however, Optus landlines were unable to make emergency triple-zero calls.[19][20] The outage affected the communication systems for Melbourne's train network, so for safety reasons the whole network was halted until backup communications commenced, leading to major delays and cancellations throughout the day.[21][22][23] Dodo, Amaysim and Coles Mobile rely on the Optus network as resellers, and, as a result, they also experienced outages across the country.[24] Corporate affairs[edit] Chief Executive Officer[edit] Kelly Bayer Rosmarin commenced as CEO of Optus and Consumer Australia on 1 April 2020. She resigned on 20 November 2023.[25] The hybrid fibre-coax rollout[edit] This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources.

(June 2012) (template removal help) Former Optus building in Adelaide, South Australia These practices meant that Optus was the largest customer of Telstra. To become competitive Optus would need to lay its own local phone network. To provide a killer application for this, the Australian Federal government sold subscription television licences. Optus, as well as the Seven Network, businessman Kerry Stokes and American cable company Cablevision, formed the Optus Vision consortium. News Corporation and Telstra created the rival Foxtel consortium. Telstra's local phone network did not have the capability to deliver Foxtel pay television to consumers in the early 1990s, so Telstra identified a need to create a broadband network to support this new product. As Telstra and Optus could not agree on terms for a joint broadband cable roll out, they laid two competing cable networks, in addition to Telstra's existing copper network, at a combined cost estimated of over A$6bn. Whilst Telstra focused on creating a broadband network specifically for broadcast, Optus designed their cable network to provide telephony services in addition to broadcast television. Optus is no longer a customer of Telstra's after deciding to move the funding used to lease Telstra's copper network into constructing their hybrid fibre-coaxial network, the first in Australia. Takeovers[edit] Cable and Wireless with 24.5% stakeholder bought out Bell South's equal 24.5% shareholding in July 1997.[26] The company returned to profitability in 1998 and changed its name to Cable and Wireless Optus Pty Limited.[27] Government relaxation of foreign ownership restrictions paved the way for the company to be floated - with Cable and Wireless increasing its holding to 52.5%)[28][29] - and listed on the Australian Stock Exchange on 17 November 1998.[30] During 2001, Singtel launched a takeover bid for Cable and Wireless Optus[31] which was ultimately successful[32] and the company became known as Singtel Optus Pty Limited. In May 2004, Optus announced a $226.8 million bid for UEComm.[33] The takeover was approved in July[34] and completed in August.[35] In July 2005, Optus announced it would acquire Alphawest Ltd. for A$25.9 million.[36] The buyout was completed in November 2005 and Alphawest is now an operating division of Optus Business. On 12 January 2006, Optus acquired the remaining 74.15% of Virgin Mobile Australia for U$22.6 m, giving it 100% ownership.
