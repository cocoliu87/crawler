Vertices connected in pairs by edges A graph with six vertices and seven edges In discrete mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory, a graph is a structure amounting to a set of objects in which some pairs of the objects are in some sense "related". The objects correspond to mathematical abstractions called vertices (also called nodes or points) and each of the related pairs of vertices is called an edge (also called link or line).[1] Typically, a graph is depicted in diagrammatic form as a set of dots or circles for the vertices, joined by lines or curves for the edges. Graphs are one of the objects of study in discrete mathematics. The edges may be directed or undirected. For example, if the vertices represent people at a party, and there is an edge between two people if they shake hands, then this graph is undirected because any person A can shake hands with a person B only if B also shakes hands with A. In contrast, if an edge from a person A to a person B means that A owes money to B, then this graph is directed, because owing money is not necessarily reciprocated. Graphs are the basic subject studied by graph theory. The word "graph" was first used in this sense by J. J. Sylvester in 1878 due to a direct relation between mathematics and chemical structure (what he called a chemico-graphical image).[2][3] Definitions[edit] Definitions in graph theory vary. The following are some of the more basic ways of defining graphs and related mathematical structures. Graph[edit] A graph with three vertices and three edges A graph (sometimes called an undirected graph to distinguish it from a directed graph, or a simple graph to distinguish it from a multigraph)[4][5] is a pair G = (V, E), where V is a set whose elements are called vertices (singular: vertex), and E is a set of paired vertices, whose elements are called edges (sometimes links or lines). The vertices x and y of an edge {x, y} are called the endpoints of the edge. The edge is said to join x and y and to be incident on x and y. A vertex may belong to no edge, in which case it is not joined to any other vertex. A multigraph is a generalization that allows multiple edges to have the same pair of endpoints. In some texts, multigraphs are simply called graphs.[6][7] Sometimes, graphs are allowed to contain loops, which are edges that join a vertex to itself. To allow loops, the pairs of vertices in E must be allowed to have the same node twice. Such generalized graphs are called graphs with loops or simply graphs when it is clear from the context that loops are allowed. Generally, the set of vertices V is supposed to be finite; this implies that the set of edges is also finite. Infinite graphs are sometimes considered, but are more often viewed as a special kind of binary relation, as most results on finite graphs do not extend to the infinite case, or need a rather different proof. An empty graph is a graph that has an empty set of vertices (and thus an empty set of edges). The order of a graph is its number of vertices |V|. The size of a graph is its number of edges |E|. However, in some contexts, such as for expressing the computational complexity of algorithms, the size is |V| + |E| (otherwise, a non-empty graph could have size 0). The degree or valency of a vertex is the number of edges that are incident to it; for graphs [1]with loops, a loop is counted twice. In a graph of order n, the maximum degree of each vertex is n − 1 (or n + 1 if loops are allowed, because a loop contributes 2 to the degree), and the maximum number of edges is n(n − 1)/2 (or n(n + 1)/2 if loops are allowed). The edges of a graph define a symmetric relation on the vertices, called the adjacency relation. Specifically, two vertices x and y are adjacent if {x, y} is an edge. A graph may be fully specified by its adjacency matrix A, which is an n × n square matrix, with Aij specifying the number of connections from vertex i to vertex j. For a simple graph, Aij is either 0, indicating disconnection, or 1, indicating connection; moreover Aii = 0 because an edge in a simple graph cannot start and end at the same vertex. Graphs with self-loops will be characterized by some or all Aii being equal to a positive integer, and multigraphs (with multiple edges between vertices) will be characterized by some or all Aij being equal to a positive integer. Undirected graphs will have a symmetric adjacency matrix (meaning Aij = Aji). Directed graph[edit] Main article: Directed graph A directed graph with three vertices and four directed edges (the double arrow represents an edge in each direction) A directed graph or digraph is a graph in which edges have orientations. In one restricted but very common sense of the term,[8] a directed graph is a pair G = (V, E) comprising: V, a set of vertices (also called nodes or points); E, a set of edges (also called directed edges, directed links, directed lines, arrows, or arcs), which are ordered pairs of distinct vertices: E ⊆ { ( x , y ) ∣ ( x , y ) ∈ V 2 and x ≠ y } {\displaystyle E\subseteq \{(x,y)\mid (x,y)\in V^{2}\;{\textrm {and}}\;x\neq y\}} . To avoid ambiguity, this type of object may be called precisely a directed simple graph. In the edge (x, y) directed from x to y, the vertices x and y are called the endpoints of the edge, x the tail of the edge and y the head of the edge. The edge is said to join x and y and to be incident on x and on y. A vertex may exist in a graph and not belong to an edge. The edge (y, x) is called the inverted edge of (x, y). Multiple edges, not allowed under the definition above, are two or more edges with both the same tail and the same head. In one more general sense of the term allowing multiple edges,[8] a directed graph is sometimes defined to be an ordered triple G = (V, E, ϕ) comprising: V, a set of vertices (also called nodes or points); E, a set of edges (also called directed edges, directed links, directed lines, arrows or arcs); ϕ, an incidence function mapping every edge to an ordered pair of vertices (that is, an edge is associated with two distinct vertices): ϕ : E → { ( x , y ) ∣ ( x , y ) ∈ V 2 and x ≠ y } {\displaystyle \phi :E\to \{(x,y)\mid (x,y)\in V^{2}\;{\textrm {and}}\;x\neq y\}} . To avoid ambiguity, this type of object may be called precisely a directed multigraph. A loop is an edge that joins a vertex to itself. Directed graphs as defined in the two definitions above cannot have loops, because a loop joining a vertex x {\displaystyle x} to itself is the edge (for a directed simple graph) or is incident on (for a directed multigraph) ( x , x ) {\displaystyle (x,x)} which is not in { ( x , y ) ∣ ( x , y ) ∈ V 2 and x ≠ y } {\displaystyle \{(x,y)\mid (x,y)\in V^{2}\;{\textrm {and}}\;x\neq y\}} . So to allow loops the definitions must be expanded. For directed simple graphs, the definition of E {\displaystyle E} should be modified to E ⊆ { ( x , y ) ∣ ( x , y ) ∈ V 2 } {\displaystyle E\subseteq \{(x,y)\mid (x,y)\in V^{2}\}} . For directed multigraphs, the definition of ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } should be modified to ϕ : E → { ( x , y ) ∣ ( x , y ) ∈ V 2 } {\displaystyle \phi :E\to \{(x,y)\mid (x,y)\in V^{2}\}} . To avoid ambiguity, these types of objects may be called precisely a directed simple graph permitting loops and a directed multigraph permitting loops (or a quiver) respectively. The edges of a directed simple graph permitting loops G is a homogeneous relation ~ on the vertices of G that is called the adjacency relation of G. Specifically, for each edge (x, y), its endpoints x and y are said to be adjacent to one another, which is denoted x ~ y. Mixed graph[edit] Main article: Mixed graph A mixed graph is a graph in which some edges may be directed and some may be undirected. It is an ordered triple G = (V, E, A) for a mixed simple graph and G = (V, E, A, ϕE, ϕA) for a mixed multigraph with V, E (the undirected edges), A (the directed edges), ϕE and ϕA defined as above. Directed and undirected graphs are special cases. Weighted graph[edit] A weighted graph with ten vertices and twelve edges A weighted graph or a network[9][10] is a graph in which a number (the weight) is assigned to each edge.[11] Such weights might represent for example costs, lengths or capacities, depending on the problem at hand. Such graphs arise in many contexts, for example in shortest path problems such as the traveling salesman problem. Types of graphs[edit] Oriented graph[edit] One definition of an oriented graph is that it is a directed graph in which at most one of (x, y) and (y, x) may be edges of the graph. That is, it is a directed graph that can be formed as an orientation of an undirected (simple) graph. Some authors use "oriented graph" to mean the same as "directed graph". Some authors use "oriented graph" to mean any orientation of a given undirected graph or multigraph. Regular graph[edit] Main article: Regular graph A regular graph is a graph in which each vertex has the same number of neighbours, i.e., every vertex has the same degree. A regular graph with vertices of degree k is called a k‑regular graph or regular graph of degree k. Complete graph[edit] Main article: Complete graph A complete graph with five vertices and ten edges. Each vertex has an edge to every other vertex. A complete graph is a graph in which each pair of vertices is joined by an edge. A complete graph contains all possible edges. Finite graph[edit] A finite graph is a graph in which the vertex set and the edge set are finite sets. Otherwise, it is called an infinite graph. Most commonly in graph theory it is implied that the graphs discussed are finite. If the graphs are infinite, that is usually specifically stated. Connected graph[edit] Main article: Connectivity (graph theory) In an undirected graph, an unordered pair of vertices {x, y} is called conn contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 54 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Graph_(graph_theory) responseCode 3 200
