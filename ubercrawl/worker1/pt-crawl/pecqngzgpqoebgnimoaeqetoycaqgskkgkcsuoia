The cabinet comprises members of the PSOE (including its sister party, the Socialists' Party of Catalonia, PSC) and Unidas Podemos—with the involvement of Podemos, United Left (IU), the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) and En Comú Podem (ECP)—as well as independents proposed by both parties, to become the first nationwide coalition government to be formed in Spain since the Second Spanish Republic.[2][3] It has been alternatively dubbed as the "progressive coalition" (Spanish: coalición progresista), after the name of the political agreement signed by PSOE and Unidas Podemos.[4][5] It was automatically dismissed on 24 July 2023 as a consequence of the 2023 general election, but remains in acting capacity until the next government is sworn in.[6][7] At 22 ministries, it is the second largest cabinet in Spain since the country's transition to democracy, only behind the third Súarez government; the first time that a government includes four deputy prime ministers; and the third oldest government to be formed, with a median age of 54.2 upon its formation.[8][9] After the July 2021 cabinet reshuffle, the median age of the government lowered to 50, and the proportion of women at ministerial posts increased to 63.6% (14 out of 22).[10] Investiture[edit] Further information: April 2019 Spanish general election, November 2019 Spanish general election, and 2019–2020 Spanish government formation Investiture Pedro Sánchez (PSOE) Ballot → 5 January 2020 7 January 2020 Required majority → 176 out of 350 N Simple Y Yes • PSOE (120) • UP–ECP–GeC (35) (34 on 5 Jan) • PNV (6) • Más País (2) • Compromís (1) • NCa (1) • BNG (1) • TE (1) 166 / 350 167 / 350 No • PP (88) • Vox (52) • Cs (10) • JxCat (8) • CUP (2) • NA+ (2) • CCa (1) • PRC (1) • FAC (1) 165 / 350 165 / 350 Abstentions • ERC (13) • EH Bildu (5) 18 / 350 18 / 350 Absentees • UP–ECP–GeC (1) (on 5 Jan) 1 / 350 0 / 350 Sources[11][12] Cabinet changes[edit] Sánchez's second government saw a number of cabinet changes during its tenure: On 30 December 2020, it was announced that Salvador Illa would be stepping down as Minister of Health in order to run as the Socialists' Party of Catalonia (PSC)'s leading candidate for President of the Government of Catalonia in the upcoming 2021 Catalan regional election.[13] Minister of Territorial Policy and Civil Service Carolina Darias was proposed to replace him in his post due to her knowledge and cooperation in Illa's ministry's management of the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas outgoing PSC candidate Miquel Iceta was commented as a likely pick for Darias's former ministry.[14][15] After the surprise announcement on 10 March 2021 by Madrilenian president Isabel Díaz Ayuso to expel Citizens (Cs) from her government and call a snap election in the Community of Madrid for 4 May, as a result of a foiled attempt from both PSOE and Cs to bring down the Murcian government of Fernando López Miras, the second deputy prime minister Pablo Iglesias announced that he would be stepping down in shortly from his cabinet posts in order to run as the Unidas Podemos leading candidate in the regional election.[16] Iglesias pointed to Labour and Social Economy minister Yolanda Díaz as his successor in the Unidas Podemos leadership, whereas State Secretary for the 2030 Agenda, Ione Belarra, would replace him at the helm of the Ministry of Social Rights and 2030 Agenda.[17][18] Díaz would be appointed as new third deputy prime minister as a way to compensate for her strong labour portfolio, whereas Nadia Calviño was to ascend as new second deputy.[19] On 10 July 2021, Pedro Sánchez unveiled one of the largest cabinet reshuffles in Spanish democracy: seven ministers—Carmen Calvo (First Deputy and Presidency), Arancha González Laya (Foreign Affairs), Juan Carlos Campo (Justice), José Luis Ábalos (Transport), Isabel Celaá (Education), José Manuel Rodríguez Uribes (Culture) and Pedro Duque (Science)—were replaced by new officeholders, with further two ministries (Finance and Territorial Policy) seeing changes in their structures, with civil service competences being transferred from the latter to the former, as well as the office of the spokesperson of the Government. After Calvo's dismissal from the cabinet, the third remaining deputy prime ministers (Nadia Calviño, Yolanda Díaz and Teresa Ribera) were promoted, with the post of the fourth deputy prime minister being disestablished.[20] The changes were effective from 12 July, with the new ministers taking their posts on that day.[21] On 16 December 2021, Manuel Castells announced his will to resign as Ministry of Universities due to health concerns, being replaced in the post on 20 December by Joan Subirats, former councillor in the City Council of Barcelona under mayoress Ada Colau.[22] On 14 and 17 November 2022, Industry and Health ministers Reyes Maroto and Carolina Darias were announced as PSOE candidates for the mayorships of Madrid and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, respectively.[23][24] They were both replaced in their posts by Héctor Gómez and José Miñones on 28 March 2023, one week ahead of the official call of the 28 May local elections.[25] Council of Ministers[edit] The Council of Ministers is structured into the offices for the prime minister, the four deputy prime ministers, 22 ministries and the post of the spokesperson of the Government.[26][27][28][29] From July 2021, the Council would include only three deputy prime ministers.[30] ← Sánchez II Government → (13 January 2020 – 21 November 2023) Portfolio Name Party Took office Left office Ref.
