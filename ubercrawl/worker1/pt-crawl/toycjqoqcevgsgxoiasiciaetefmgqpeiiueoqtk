This was the first Asia Cup hosted by Pakistan; previously political tensions between India and Pakistan did not permit Pakistan to host the event in 1993. It was broadcast in India by Star Cricket and ESPN[2] and in Pakistan by Geo Super.[3] Sri Lanka won the tournament after beating India by 100 runs in the final.[4] Format[edit] Originally, the ninth version of the Cup was supposed to take place in 2006, however packed international cricket schedules did not allow for the tournament to be held.[5] Group A consisted of Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates. Group B consisted of India, Pakistan and Hong Kong. The two groups first had a separate round-robin competition. The top two teams from each group advanced to the Super Fours. There was again a round-robin competition between the teams in the Super Four, the first two from which advanced to the final. Venues[edit] 13 matches were played in 2008 Asia Cup at National Stadium, Karachi and Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore.
