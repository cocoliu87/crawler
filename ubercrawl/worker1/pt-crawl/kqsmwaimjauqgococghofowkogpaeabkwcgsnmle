Adele and Tobias Jesso Jr. wrote the song, and Ariel Rechtshaid produced it. The song was written within three days in Los Angeles, after Adele struggled with writer's block during unfruitful early sessions for the album. XL Recordings released it as the album's second single on 22 January 2016. A soul ballad, the song has piano instrumentation that places emphasis on Adele's vocals. Inspired by the vision of meeting acquaintances at a party at an older age, it explores the fear of getting older and the loss of one's youth. "When We Were Young" received acclaim from music critics, with praise directed towards its production and emotional lyrics. The song reached the top 10 in 11 countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, and Scotland. It received a 5× Platinum certification in Canada, a 3× Platinum certification in the UK, and a 2× Platinum certification in Denmark and Norway. A performance filmed at The Church Studios in London was released on Vevo. Adele performed the song during her television specials, and at Saturday Night Live, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, and the Brit Awards 2016. Background and release[edit] American record producer Ariel Rechtshaid produced the song. Adele announced in February 2013 that she was holding various meetings related to her third studio album.[1] Initial recording sessions for the album were unfruitful, she recounted: "I felt like I was never going to finish this record. It was a long process. I wanted to give up a lot because I couldn't do it. I thought I'd run out of ideas and I'd lost my ability to write a song."[2] Adele struggled with writer's block and her manager, who was also unsure about the material, asked Rick Rubin, a producer of many songs on her sophomore studio album 21 (2011). Rubin claimed he didn't believe in the songs. Adele, too, admitted she felt it was a little rushed.[3] In early 2015, she flew to Los Angeles to work with new songwriters and producers for two months, including Canadian musician Tobias Jesso Jr.,[3] after discovering his song "Hollywood".[4] Their managers talked about the collaboration, and they spent about three days writing,[5] conceiving "When We Were Young". The song was written in a house in Los Angeles, at Philip Glass' piano that Jesso had inherited.[5][6] They started the song from scratch, as Jesso "would play chords while Adele improvised melodies and lyrics".[3] As Jesso recounted, "There was no studio, just a piano and us, and we wrote a lot. I mean a lot lot."[7] American record producer Ariel Rechtshaid heard rumours that Adele and Jesso wanted to work with him. He flew to London and produced two songs for her. After Adele told him that she loved the track, but had a lot of ballads on the album already, he returned to Los Angeles and started creating a rhythm track for it. Rechtshaid recalled struggling not to make it "over-the-top dramatic, kind of epic". He thought the song had "an old soul vibe", and desired to have it "a little bit more modern". Rechtshaid told The Fader that it only took two takes to record the song, and during the middle eight, he pushed Adele beyond her means, since he "felt that it needed to have a little bit more cry to it".[8] On 16 November 2015, Australian TV program 60 Minutes broadcast a preview of "When We Were Young".[9] A day later, the song's performance at the Church Studios in London was uploaded to Vevo.[10] On 26 November 2015, Billboard wrote an article questioning what would be 25's next single, indicating either "When We Were Young" or "Send My Love (To Your New Lover)" would be their pick.[11] On 12 December 2015, the magazine confirmed "When We Were Young" as the album's second single, through a source at Columbia Records.[12] It was released for radio airplay in Italy on 22 January 2016,[13] and for digital download in various countries on 29 January 2016.[14][15][16] The official artwork features "a throwback picture of her younger self".[17] Lindsay Sullivan of Billboard called it "adorable",[18] while Lewis Corner of Digital Spy wondered, "How much more cute can you get than a primary school Adele, grinning from ear to ear with her two front teeth missing?"[17] Composition and lyrical interpretation[edit] "When We Were Young" A 29-second sample of the song's chorus, where Adele nostalgically reminisces about past memories with an old acquaintance.[19] Problems playing this file?

There's only her begging for a photo, because she's worried the future won't ever be as good as the past was."[26] In an interview with Sirius XM, Adele said the song "was based on us being older, and being at a party at this house, and seeing everyone that you've ever fallen out with, everyone that you've ever loved, everyone that you've never loved".[27] In a song by song analysis by The New York Times, she recounted having "a vision of my best friend putting makeup on me for the first time when I was 17" while performing the song during rehearsals, which she appreciated: "Every time a new memory comes back in one of my songs for myself, I love it. It's like remembering your life through song."[28] When interviewed by Nick Grimshaw on BBC Radio 1, Adele said that "When We Were Young" was her favourite track off 25.[29] Critical reception[edit] "When We Were Young" was met with acclaim from music critics. Gordon named it "Best New Track" and praised Adele's vocal performance and how she was "capable of elevating maudlin sentiment into high art".[23] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic selected the song as one of the album's highlights, noting that she took a risk enlisting Retchshaid to produce the track.[30] Leah Greenblatt from Entertainment Weekly considered it one of the three best tracks of the album, noting that she was sincere with the nostalgic theme.[31] Steven Arroyo of Consequence of Sound selected the song as one of the essential tracks on 25.[32] Rob Garratt from The National was positive about Adele's writing skills, and praised her "fragilely affecting, but ultimately affirming" performance.[33] Writing for Inquirer, Joseph R. Atilano remarked, "A single like this further showcases how lyrically intelligent she is as a composer as well as one of the greatest pure singers alive today."[34] Matt Bagwell of The Huffington Post called it "stunning", and named it "the album's 'Someone Like You' – in other words, the 'big ballad'".[35] Corner noted that the lyrics "will squeeze your heart and give you a minor midlife crisis. That won't stop you from playing it over and over, though."[36] Corbin Reiff from The A.V. Club praised Adele's "incredible, gritty sultriness on the verses".[37] Justin Charity of Complex was also positive about her vocals, calling it "the wildest blossom of Adele's voice".[38] Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone labelled the song a "mature [...] torchy ballad",[39] while T. Cole Rachel of Spin defined it as "the kind of mawkish, overcooked melodrama that one imagines Adele could perform in her sleep".[40] Chris Gerard from PopMatters was praiseful, naming the song "a bittersweet epic", and adding, "'When We Were Young' is breathtaking, an example of how great Adele can be when all the stars align.
