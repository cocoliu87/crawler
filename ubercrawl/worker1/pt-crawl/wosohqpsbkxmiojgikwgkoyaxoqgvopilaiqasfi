There is a simplified version of this page at Help:How to move a page. On Wikipedia, a page can usually be renamed if the already existing title is incorrect or needs to be changed; this is called moving a page. A page may also be moved to another namespace without changing the base title—for example, a userspace draft may be moved to article space. Autoconfirmed rights are required for page moving, but you may request a page move at Wikipedia:Requested moves if you are not yet autoconfirmed, if there is a technical barrier to the move, or if the retitling is expected to be controversial and you need to seek consensus for the name change. Files (images and media) can be moved only by Wikipedia administrators and file movers, but moves can be requested. Category moves should be investigated and planned before they are initiated. Please post requests for category moves at Wikipedia:Categories for discussion if you are, or expect to be, unable to complete the process. Do not move or rename a page by cutting and pasting its content, because doing so fragments the edit history. Instead, please follow the instructions given below. Reasons for moving a page There are many reasons why you might wish to move a page: The title does not follow Wikipedia's naming conventions, such as that it is not the common name of the subject or it is overprecise. The subject of the article has changed its name and the new name has come into majority use. The title has been misspelled, does not contain standard capitalization or punctuation, or is misleading or inaccurate. It needs to be disambiguated in some way to avoid confusion with an existing, similarly named topic, or it exists at a disambiguated name but should not because it is the primary topic. It is an article at a descriptive name and the scope of the article has been reduced, extended or otherwise changed. It is an article that has been created as a subpage of a Wikipedian's user or user talk space for development purposes and it is ready to be posted to the mainspace or to draft space. It is a draft article that has been created or edited in draft space for development purposes and it is ready to be posted to the mainspace. Technical restrictions Technical restrictions prevent the storage of titles beginning with a lowercase letter, containing certain characters, and using formatting such as italics. Templates which may be used as workarounds include: Title changing or correcting templates + magic word view talk edit Wiki markup Transclusion from template: Involves Correct name Actual article name {{Italic title}} Title in italics To Kill a Mockingbird To Kill a Mockingbird {{Italic title|all=yes}} Complete title in italics, including parentheses Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) {{Italic title|string=Ally McBeal}} Phrase of |string= in italics List of Ally McBeal episodes List of Ally McBeal episodes {{Italic title|all=yes|string=Fringe}} Phrase of |string= in italics; also looks in parentheses Peter (Fringe episode) Peter (Fringe episode) {{Italic disambiguation}} Disambiguation in italics The End (Lost) The End (Lost) {{Lowercase title}} Lowercase first character eBay EBay {{Lowercase title|italic=yes}} Lowercase first character and place title in italics, not including disambiguation iCarly (soundtrack) ICarly (soundtrack) {{Lowercase title|italic=yes|force=yes}} Lowercase first character and place title in italics, including disambiguation {{Lowercase title|dab=yes}} Lowercase first character and place disambiguation in italics iSpy (Modern Family) ISpy (Modern Family) {{Correct title|reason=bracket}} < > [ ] { } Benzo[a]pyrene Benzo(a)pyrene {{Correct title|reason=#}} # Pilot #5 Pilot No. 5 {{Correct title|reason=:}} : DK: King of Swing DK King of Swing Magic word: {{DISPLAYTITLE}} Various _NSAKEY NSAKEY Before moving a page Shortcut WP:BEFOREMOVING Consider listing pages that you want to have renamed/moved at Wikipedia:Requested moves. List them at Wikipedia:Requested moves/Technical requests if it appears unlikely that anyone would reasonably disagree with the move, and: You are unable to move the page because your account is too new (the account must be autoconfirmed) You are unable to move the page because the target page exists The page is protected from moves The target page is protected from creation For other cases, follow the instructions for controversial and potentially controversial moves: If you believe the move might be controversial If you are unsure about the best page name, despite reading Wikipedia:Article naming guidelines If you believe your proposed move would benefit from wider community input Do not move or rename a page by copying/pasting its content, because doing so fragments the edit history. (Wikipedia's copyright license requires acknowledgement of all contributors, and editors continue to hold copyright on their contributions unless they specifically give up this right. Hence, it is required that edit histories be preserved for all major contributions until the normal copyright expires. See also Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia.) If you find a cut-and-paste move that needs to be fixed, please follow the instructions at Wikipedia:Requests for history merge to have an administrator take care of the problem. If you need technical help in a simple page move situation which is blocked by history at the target of the move, list the page at Wikipedia:Requested moves/Technical requests following the listing procedure outlined there. How to move a page Parts of this Wikipedia page (those related to section) need to be updated. The reason given is: Description and images don't quite match WP:VECTOR2022. Please help update this Wikipedia page to reflect recent events or newly available information. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. See also: Help:How to move a page The move option in the Vector skin appears when you move your mouse cursor over the small drop-down menu, shown here. A common example: moving a userspace draft into place. The intended article name is entered without any prefixes. To be able to move pages yourself, you must be logged in and you must have an autoconfirmed account (i.e., generally you must have had the account for four days and made at least ten article edits with it). Moreover, the move will fail if a page already exists at the target name, unless it is simply a redirect to the present name that has never been modified, in which case you can move over the redirect (check the edit history). If you cannot move a page yourself because of a technical restriction, and you expect the move to be uncontroversial, you can list it at the technical section of requested moves. Otherwise, you can make your request at its section for controversial and potentially controversial moves. To move a page: Go to the page that you want to move. There is no need to click "Edit". Locate the "Move" option at the top of the page. Most users will find the "Move" option in a drop-down menu at the top right of the screen, labelled "More", after "History" and the "Watchlist" star (see picture). It may be under a menu labelled "Page" if you have enabled "MoreMenu" at Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-gadgets. The layout of the screen will be different if you have selected a "skin" other than the default Vector in your preferences. In the Monobook skin, it is a tab at the top. If there is no "move" link at the top of the page at all, the page is most likely protected from moving. Ask for the page to be moved at the technical move request page. Click the "Move" option, and fill in the details of your move. If the page is for the main encyclopedia, choose "(Article)" from the drop-down box. Otherwise choose the appropriate namespace prefix. To the right of the text box, enter the new name of the page as the "New title". Give a reason for the move (which is like an edit summary). Although filling out the "Reason" field isn't required, you should state a reason for the page move. Choose whether to also move the page's talk page (this box should usually be left checked). This box is not present if the page has no talk page. When ready, click the Move page button and, if successful, the page will be renamed to the new title. The old title will become a redirect page, so any links to the old title will still go to the new page. However, note that double redirects (pages that redirect to the original page), will not automatically follow to the new page, so you will have to refer them manually (as explained at How to fix a double redirect and Checking for double redirects). A successful page move will be recorded in the Move Log (against the old page name) and a "move has succeeded" message will be displayed, on a page looking like this: MediaWiki:Movepage-moved. If the old page was protected, its protection settings will be generally automatically copied to the new page, and thus be recorded in the Protection Log (against the new page name). If Pending changes was enabled, the settings will be moved but they will not be logged against the new page title.
