It is not one of Wikipedia's policies or guidelines, but rather intends to describe some aspect(s) of Wikipedia's norms, customs, technicalities, or practices. It may reflect varying levels of consensus and vetting. Shortcut WP:MPRP This page in a nutshell: Re-designing Wikipedia's main page has been a perennial proposal since the last major revamp in 2006. There have been periodic attempts to revamp the design of Wikipedia's main page. In 2003, 2004, and 2006, there were successful main page redesign proposals. Since 2006, there have been no successful proposals to significantly redesign the main page. However, it is always possible to request feedback from other editors on proposed changes, usually through discussion or requests for comment at Talk:Main Page, Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals) or Wikipedia:Village pump (idea lab). You can test changes in your user sandbox or another subpage. Enacted changes[edit] Changes to content used in the main page, such as to the list of sister projects, are not listed. All archives linked display the current content; for archives of the content on particular days, see Wikipedia:Main Page history.
