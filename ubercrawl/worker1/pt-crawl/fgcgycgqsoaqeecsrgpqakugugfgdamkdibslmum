A symbol of the city, it is known for its density within the capital's territorial limits, uniform architecture and unique entrances influenced by Art Nouveau. The system is 226.9 kilometres (141.0 mi) long, mostly underground.[3] It has 308 stations of which 64 have transfers between lines.[1][4] There are 16 lines (with an additional four under construction), numbered 1 to 14, with two lines, 3bis and 7bis, named because they started out as branches of Line 3 and Line 7, respectively. Line 1, Line 4[5] and Line 14 are automated. Lines are identified on maps by number and colour, with the direction of travel indicated by the terminus. It is the second busiest metro system in Europe, after the Moscow Metro, as well as the tenth-busiest in the world.[6] It carried 1.498 billion passengers in 2019, roughly 4.1 million passengers a day, which makes it the most used public transport system in Paris.[7] It is one of the densest metro systems in the world, with 244 stations within the 105.4 km2 (41 sq mi) of the City of Paris. Châtelet–Les Halles, with five Métro and three RER lines, is one of the world's largest metro stations.[8] However, the system generally has poor accessibility since most stations had been built underground well before ease of access was taken into consideration. The first line opened without ceremony on 19 July 1900, during the World's Fair (Exposition Universelle).[3] The system expanded quickly until World War I and the core was complete by the 1920s; extensions into suburbs were built in the 1930s. The network reached saturation after World War II with new trains to allow higher traffic, but further improvements have been limited by the design of the network and, in particular, the short distances between stations. Besides the Métro, central Paris and its urban area are served by five RER lines (587 km (365 mi) with 257 stations), thirteen tramway lines (164 km (102 mi) with 248 stations),[9] eight Transilien suburban trains (1,299 km (807 mi) with 392 stations),[10] as well as three VAL lines at Charles de Gaulle Airport and Orly Airport.[11] In the late 1990s, Line 14 was put into service to relieve RER A. Line 12 reaching Mairie d'Aubervilliers in 2022[12] is the network's most recent extension. A large expansion programme (Grand Paris Express) is currently under construction with four new orbital Métro lines (15, 16, 17 and 18) around the Île-de-France region, outside the Paris city limits. Other extensions are currently under construction on Line 11 and Line 14. Further plans exist for Line 1 and Line 10 and for a merger of Line 3bis and Line 7bis. Naming[edit] Métro signage Métro is the abbreviated name of the company that originally operated most of the network: the Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris S.A. ("Paris Metropolitan Railway Company Ltd."), shortened to "Le Métropolitain". It was quickly abbreviated to Métro, which became a common designation and brand name for rapid transit systems in France and in many cities elsewhere. The Métro is operated by the Régie autonome des transports parisiens (RATP), a public transport authority that also operates part of the RER network, light rail lines and many bus routes. The name Métro was adopted in many languages, making it the most used word for a (generally underground) urban transit system. It is possible that "Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain" was copied from the name of London's pioneering underground railway company,[13] the Metropolitan Railway, which had been in business for almost 40 years prior to the inauguration of Paris's first line.[14] History[edit] During the initial construction of the Métro, the tunnels were excavated in open sites and then covered. Bastille station at the beginning of the 20th century By 1845, Paris and the railway companies were already thinking about an urban railway system to link inner districts of the city. The railway companies and the French government wanted to extend mainline railways into a new underground network, whereas the Parisians favoured a new and independent network and feared national takeover of any system it built.[15] The disagreement lasted from 1856 to 1890. Meanwhile, the population became denser and traffic congestion grew massively. The deadlock put pressure on the authorities and gave the city the green light. Prior to 1845, the urban transport network consisted primarily of a large number of omnibus lines, consolidated by the French government into a regulated system with fixed and unconflicting routes and schedules.[16] The first concrete proposal for an urban rail system in Paris was put forward by civil engineer Florence de Kérizouet. This plan called for a surface cable car system.[17] In 1855, civil engineers Edouard Brame and Eugène Flachat proposed an underground freight urban railroad, due to the high rate of accidents on surface rail lines.[17] On 19 November 1871 the General Council of the Seine commissioned a team of 40 engineers to plan an urban rail network.[18] This team proposed a network with a pattern of routes "resembling a cross enclosed in a circle" with axial routes following large boulevards. On 11 May 1872 the Council endorsed the plan, but the French government turned down the plan.[18] After this point, a serious debate occurred over whether the new system should consist of elevated lines or of mostly underground lines; this debate involved numerous parties in France, including Victor Hugo, Guy de Maupassant, and the Eiffel Society of Gustave Eiffel, and continued until 1892.[19] Eventually the underground option emerged as the preferred solution because of the high cost of buying land for rights-of-way in central Paris required for elevated lines, estimated at 70,000 francs per metre of line for a 20 meters (65 ft 7 in)-wide railroad.[20] The last remaining hurdle was the city's concern about national interference in its urban rail system. The city commissioned renowned engineer Jean-Baptiste Berlier, who designed Paris' postal network of pneumatic tubes, to design and plan its rail system in the early 1890s.[20] Berlier recommended a special track gauge of 1,300 mm ( 4 ft 3+3⁄16 in) (versus the standard gauge of 1,435 mm or 4 ft 8+1⁄2 in) to protect the system from national takeover, which inflamed the issue substantially.[21] The issue was finally settled when the Minister of Public Works begrudgingly recognized the city's right to build a local system on 22 November 1895, and by the city's secret designing of the trains and tunnels to be too narrow for mainline trains, while adopting standard gauge as a compromise with the state.[21] Fulgence Bienvenüe project[edit] Construction of Chevaleret station, 1903 Line 2 near Jaurès station On 20 April 1896, Paris adopted the Fulgence Bienvenüe project, which was to serve only the city proper of Paris. Many Parisians worried that extending lines to industrial suburbs would reduce the safety of the city. Paris forbade lines to the inner suburbs and, as a guarantee, Métro trains were to run on the right, as opposed to existing suburban lines, which ran on the left. Unlike many other subway systems (such as that of London), this system was designed from the outset as a system of (initially) nine lines.[22] Such a large project required a private-public arrangement right from the outset – the city would build most of the permanent way, while a private concessionaire company would supply the trains and power stations, and lease the system (each line separately, for initially 39-year leases).[further explanation needed][22] In July 1897, six bidders competed, and The Compagnie Generale de Traction, owned by the Belgian Baron Édouard Empain, won the contract; thi contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 50 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Paris_M%C3%A9tro responseCode 3 200
