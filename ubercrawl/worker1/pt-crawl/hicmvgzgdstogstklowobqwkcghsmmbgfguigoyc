The comments were part of a growing rift between him and army leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan.[22][23] In April 2023, Dagalo mobilized the RSF against al-Burhan's government, claiming to capture key government sites, though al-Burhan has disputed this.[24] According to Human Rights Watch[25] and professor Eric Reeves,[26] the RSF[11][12] was responsible for crimes against humanity, including systematic killings of civilians and rapes, in Darfur in 2014 and 2015. Hemetti was also involved in the 23 November 2004 attack on the village of Adwa which resulted in a massacre and rape, and said that the attacks had been planned for months.[27] According to Al Jazeera and The Daily Beast, the Sudanese Transitional Military Council, headed by the RSF, holds major responsibility for the 3 June 2019 Khartoum massacre.[4][5] Childhood and youth[edit] Sources differ on Hemetti's date of birth, with various publications placing it at differing points between 1973 and 1975.[2][1][9] The nephew of Juma Dagalo, chief of the Rizeigat tribe of the nomadic Baggara Arabs, Hemetti attended primary school up to third grade[9] and received no other formal education.[28] He moved to North Darfur and then settled in South Darfur in 1987.[2] He is a member of the Awlad Mansour sub-section of the Mahariya tribe,[2] which is part of the camel-herding (Abbala) Northern Rizeigat tribal confederation.[29] Hemetti may have traded camels prior to the War in Darfur.[9][28] This claim was called into question with at least one source instead calling him "a highwayman."[30] However this claim was later debunked by Jerome Tubiana, a researcher, journalist and the International Crisis Group’s former senior Sudan analyst.[31] Paramilitary career and criminal allegations[edit] See also: International Criminal Court investigation in Darfur He was one of the perpetrators of the Darfur genocide.[32] Hemetti became a leader of the Janjaweed during the War in Darfur that started in 2003[9] and an "amir" in the Border Guards in the same year.[2] He was appointed brigadier–general in the newly created Rapid Support Forces (RSF) by the 1989–2019 government of Omar al-Bashir, who, as of 10 June 2019[update], is a fugitive indicted for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide by the International Criminal Court (ICC).[33][34] The RSF was created in 2013 under the leadership of Hemetti, out of former Janjaweed groups of fighters, several of whose leaders and supporters (Ahmed Haroun, Ali Kushayb, Abdel Rahim Mohammed Hussein, in addition to al-Bashir) have been indicted for war crimes by the ICC.[9][10] Sudanese political cartoonist Khalid Albaih claimed that the soldiers commanded by Hemetti "committed countless war crimes" during the war.[5] A European diplomat interviewed by The National claimed that Hemetti aims to "distance himself" from the war crimes that occurred during the war.[1] Niemat Ahmadi, the founder of the Darfur Women Action Group, stated that Hemetti became well known during the War in Darfur "because of the people he killed, the number of villages he destroyed, the many women who were raped".[35] Sudan researcher Eric Reeves estimated that it is "likely" that Hemetti has "accumulated more Sudanese blood on his hands in conflict in Darfur and [in the conflict in] South Kordofan—as well as in Khartoum and elsewhere—than any other man in the country" and that Hemetti's management of the war was "by means of serial atrocity crimes, including genocide and crimes against humanity".[26] 23 November 2004 Adwa massacre[edit] Hemetti was the leader of one of the Rizeigat militias who killed 126 villagers in Adwa in South Darfur in a methodical, systematic attack starting on 23 November 2004 at 6am. The militias burned all the houses, and burned some bodies and threw others in wells to hide evidence of the massacre. The militias shot male villagers immediately, raped young girls and detained women for two days. Hemetti stated to African Union officials that the massacre had been planned in coordination with government soldiers over several months.[27] 2014–2015 crimes against humanity in Darfur[edit] In 2014, the RSF, led by Hemetti, carried out the "Operation Decisive Summer" in South Darfur and North Darfur from late February to early May 2014, during which they carried out "killings, mass rape and torture of civilians; the forced displacement of entire communities; the destruction of the physical infrastructure necessary for sustaining life in the harsh desert environment including wells, food stores, shelter, and farming implements." RSF members under Hemetti's command repeatedly attacked and burned 10 towns in South Darfur, mostly during the two days starting 27 February 2014. Witnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported killings of civilians and rapes by RSF personnel.[25] Sudan Liberation Movement/Army rebels of Minni Minawi's faction (SLA/MM) had been present in some of the towns but had left them at the time of the crimes against humanity carried out under Hemetti's command. Witnesses reported men shot in the head by the RSF after having been forced to lie on the ground, and women selected for rape in the bush. Khalil, a witness from Hiraiga, stated that he saw Hemetti enter Hiraiga with other RSF members on the day that seven women, whom Khalil named, were raped either in Hiraiga or in Afouna nearby. In the village of Um Bargarain, Hemetti's RSF separated the men from the children and assassinated the men.[25] In March 2014, Hemetti's RSF moved to North Darfur and continued to destroy villages in which the SLA/MM was absent and shoot and rape civilians. In "Operation Decisive Summer" phase II, the RSF, together with other government soldiers, carried out a campaign of killings of civilians and rapes in Jebel Marra and East Jebel Marra from December 2014 to May 2015.[25] Ibrahim, a defector from RSF interviewed by HRW, stated that Hemetti and other RSF officers gave orders to "abuse women". Ibrahim saw 11 women raped during an RSF attack on Hijer Tunyo and admitted to killing one woman whom he tried to rape.[25] Crimes against humanity in Yemen[edit] See also: Human rights violations during the Yemeni civil war (2014–present) Hemetti recruited fighters from Sudan to fight as mercenaries in the Saudi–Emirati intervention in the Yemeni civil war.[36] Hemetti's RSF and other Sudanese security forces killed civilians, destroyed infrastructure and committed other war crimes.[37][38][39] Business interests[edit] Hemetti used the RSF to take over gold mines and arrest rival Janjaweed leader Musa Hilal in November 2017, with the result that Hemetti became the biggest gold trader in Sudan via his company al-Junaid.[17] This gave him considerable financial power in Sudan since gold trade constituted forty percent of Sudanese exports in 2017.[17] Al-Junaid (or Al Gunade[40]) is run by Hemetti's brother Abdul Rahim Hamdan Dagalo, the deputy head of the RSF,[41] and two of Abdul Rahim's sons.[40] Hemetti was on the Al Junaid Board of Directors in 2009.[40] By around 2019, al-Junaid had expanded to deal in "investment, mining, transpo contentType 24 text/html; charset=UTF-8 url 41 https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Hemedti responseCode 3 200
